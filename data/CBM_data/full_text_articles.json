            "The development of long-term symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) more than four weeks after primary infection, termed “long COVID” or post-acute sequela of COVID-19 (PASC), can implicate persistent neurological complications in up to one third of patients and present as fatigue, “brain fog”, headaches, cognitive impairment, dysautonomia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, anosmia, hypogeusia, and peripheral neuropathy. Pathogenic mechanisms of these symptoms of long COVID remain largely unclear; however, several hypotheses implicate both nervous system and systemic pathogenic mechanisms such as SARS-CoV2 viral persistence and neuroinvasion, abnormal immunological response, autoimmunity, coagulopathies, and endotheliopathy. Outside of the CNS, SARS-CoV-2 can invade the support and stem cells of the olfactory epithelium leading to persistent alterations to olfactory function. SARS-CoV-2 infection may induce abnormalities in innate and adaptive immunity including monocyte expansion, T-cell exhaustion, and prolonged cytokine release, which may cause neuroinflammatory responses and microglia activation, white matter abnormalities, and microvascular changes. Additionally, microvascular clot formation can occlude capillaries and endotheliopathy, due to SARS-CoV-2 protease activity and complement activation, can contribute to hypoxic neuronal injury and blood–brain barrier dysfunction, respectively. Current therapeutics target pathological mechanisms by employing antivirals, decreasing inflammation, and promoting olfactory epithelium regeneration. Thus, from laboratory evidence and clinical trials in the literature, we sought to synthesize the pathophysiological pathways underlying neurological symptoms of long COVID and potential therapeutics.",
            "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multi-system disease caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers long COVID-19 to be present when symptoms last longer than four weeks after the initial infection. The collection of symptoms goes by many names, including but not limited to “long COVID,” “chronic COVID,” “post-acute sequelae of COVID-19,” and “post-COVID conditions.” Prior studies have reported different frequencies of long COVID, ranging from 13.3% to 54% of patients after initial SARS-CoV-2 infection [1,2]. Notably, one subtype of long COVID includes neurological sequelae, which some reports have identified as being present in one third of patients in the first six months following acute COVID-19 infection. These symptoms manifest as objective abnormalities on neurological examination, such as motor/sensory deficits, hyposmia, cognitive deficits, and postural tremor [3].",
            "While prior studies have proposed potential mechanisms for the symptoms of long COVID, there are limited reports that synthesize and evaluate the pathophysiology of neurological manifestations of long COVID and its therapeutic options. In doing so, we connect basic science research, translational research, and the findings of epidemiological and clinical studies.",
            "In a meta-analysis of 257,348 COVID-19 patients, some of the most common long COVID symptoms at three to six months included fatigue (32%), dyspnea (25%), and concentration difficulty (22%), reflecting the multisystemic nature of long COVID [4].",
            "In addition to these symptoms, there is a specific cluster of specific neurological symptoms and sequelae of long COVID. For instance, in a sample of 10,530 long COVID patients at a 12-week follow-up, some of the most common neurological symptoms included fatigue (37%), brain fog (32%), memory issues (28%), attention disorder (22%), myalgia (28%), anosmia (12%), dysgeusia (10%), and headaches (15%) [5]. Some of these symptoms continue to persist at longer follow-up periods—including six-month and one-year follow-ups after initial diagnosis [6,7,8]. Considering these studies, it is evident that cognitive symptoms, headaches, sleep disorders, neuropathies, and autonomic dysfunction are some of the most common neurological manifestations of long COVID. Other, less frequent, neurological sequelae include dysexecutive syndrome, ataxia, and motor disturbances [9,10]. In all, these symptoms can lead to significant dysfunction and disability, with around 30% of long COVID patients aged 30–59 indicating that their neurological symptoms made them severely unable to function at work [10].",
            "Specific demographic risk factors for long COVID have been identified. Females were reported to have a higher risk of developing long COVID symptomatology [1,11,12,13,14,15]. Information on age is less unanimous. Several studies have reported that older patients (vs. younger) are at increased risk of developing long COVID [1,14,15,16,17]. However, other studies have shown that younger patients are at increased risk, while some studies have shown no association between age and the development of long COVID [11,12,16,18]. Regarding race/ethnicity, a study of 8325 patients with long COVID reported that non-Hispanic white patients were more likely to develop long COVID while non-Hispanic black patients were less likely to develop long COVID [14]. Alternatively, in a longitudinal analysis of 1038 patients, race/ethnicity had no significant association with long COVID occurrence [17].",
            "However, there are sparse data on the specific risk factors for neurological manifestations of long COVID. In one study, female sex and older age were shown to be associated with the neurological manifestations of long COVID, while race/ethnicity, COVID-19 severity, and other comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and congestive heart failure, were not [19]. Additionally, it has been noted that an increased severity of neurological symptoms is associated with a diminished CD4+ T cell response against the spike protein, suggesting that the T cell response is necessary to counteract the severity of neurological long COVID. In this cohort, mRNA COVID-19 vaccination elevated the T cell response and helped diminish the severity of neurological symptoms in long COVID [20].",
            "Yet overall, the impact of demographic factors such as race/ethnicity, as well as comorbidities on long COVID, needs more dedicated epidemiological studies as many of the previous studies are influenced by geographical and recruitment biases.",
            "Focusing on biological and medical factors influencing long COVID, studies have focused on the magnitude and severity derived from the acute phase of COVID-19. For patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission in the acute phase of COVID-19, long-term impairment following ICU discharge appears to be frequent. For example, in a study of 117 patients that required high-flow nasal cannulae, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or invasive mechanical ventilation, 86% reported long COVID symptoms at a six-month follow-up. These included, but were not limited to, fatigue, muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, and smell/taste disorders [6,17]. Metabolic risk factors such as a high body mass index, the presence of insulin resistance, and diabetes mellitus have been associated with long COVID [14,15,16,21,22]. Not surprisingly, patients who were “hospitalized” in the acute phase of COVID-19 were more likely to develop long COVID symptoms [15,17]. Other risk factors include Epstein–Barr virus reactivation, history of smoking, exposure to air toxicants and pollutants, and the presence of chronic comorbid conditions [13,14,20,22,23].",
            "An increased risk of mortality has been observed in COVID-19 patients with post-acute sequelae (defined as at least 365 days of follow-up time for long COVID symptoms). In a large study of 13,638 patients, an increased 12-month mortality risk after recovery from the initial infection was observed as compared with patients with suspected COVID-19 and who had a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test [24]. Additionally, long COVID patients with more severe initial infections (defined by occurrence of hospitalization) had an increased 12-month mortality risk after recovery from the initial infection and subsequent development of post-acute sequelae in comparison with patients with moderate or mild initial COVID-19 infections [24]. Furthermore, age, male sex, unvaccinated status, and baseline comorbidities were associated with higher mortality in patients with long COVID when followed over time [25]. Regarding vaccination, a systematic review of 989,174 patients across different studies demonstrated that vaccination before acute COVID-19 infection was associated with a reduced risk (RR = 0.71) of developing non-neurological symptoms of long COVID [26]. Likewise, in a survey of long COVID patients who had not yet been vaccinated, most patients had an improved average symptom score, suggesting that vaccination may play a role in mitigating the symptoms of long COVID [27].",
            "Much of the available literature focuses on mortality outcomes related to long COVID broadly. To our knowledge, there are no studies that report mortality outcomes on the neurological symptoms of long COVID specifically.",
            "The SARS-CoV-2 virus is known to invade human cells through engagement with specific membrane cell receptors which include angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) transmembrane receptor and activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) cleavage. Undoubtedly, polymorphisms that alter the ACE2 and spike protein interaction, the TMPRSS2 proteolytic cleavage site, and ACE2 expression correlate with the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 with some ACE2 variants incurring up to a three-fold increase in the development of severe disease [28,29]. Since the severity of disease is associated with the incidence of long COVID symptoms [30], there is a possibility that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 polymorphisms could potentiate long COVID as well. To our knowledge, the only study to have investigated this relationship found no predisposition of formerly identified ACE2 and TMPRSS2 polymorphisms linked to disease severity for long COVID symptoms in patients who were previously hospitalized for COVID-19 [31].",
            "Relating specifically to neurological symptoms of long COVID, receptors are expressed by endothelial and nervous system cells such as neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes [32,33,34,35,36]. However, the possibility for viral invasion of neural tissue remains highly debated. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in cortical neurons from autopsy studies and replicative potential of SARS-CoV-2 in human brain organoids implicates the neurotropic effects of the virus in the pathogenesis of neurological symptoms to some extent [36], but the possibility and mechanism of direct viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) still remain unclear. Current proposed pathways include transsynaptic invasion by transport along the olfactory tract [37], which is highly unlikely due to the lack of ACE2 receptors and TMPRSS2 on olfactory neurons [38,39,40], and hematogenous spread through invasion of choroid plexus cells and pericytes [41,42]. The latter has been shown to occur in human neural organoid models where ACE2 receptors are heavily expressed on the apical side of the choroid epithelium, allowing for SARS-CoV-2 invasion through the vasculature, subsequent ependymal cell death, and blood–CSF barrier (B-CSF-B) disruption [41]. Despite this potential for viral neuroinvasion through hematogenous means, there is overwhelming evidence showing a lack of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms [43,44], globally in the brain tissue from autopsy studies [45,46], and even within the choroid plexus of individuals with severe disease [47].",
            "In contrast, persistent anosmia is a symptom of long COVID that likely results from lasting effects of direct viral damage of the olfactory epithelium. In acute COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 can infect non-neural cell types that express ACE2 in the olfactory epithelium, specifically stem cells, perivascular cells, sustentacular cells, and Bowman’s gland cells (Figure 1), that leads to cell death and loss of uniformity demonstrated in humanized ACE2 mice [38,48]. Unlike with transient anosmia observed in other respiratory infections, imaging studies performed on patients with persistent COVID-19 anosmia demonstrated extensive damage to the olfactory epithelium; this manifests as thinning of olfactory filia and reduction in olfactory bulb volumes [39,49]. Additionally, biopsies of olfactory mucosa from patients with persistent anosmia of varying etiologies reinforce the connection between thinning of olfactory epithelium and enduring symptoms [50]. Thus, the loss of stem cells and support cells in the neuroepithelium causes failure of epithelial repair, resulting in the thinning and loss of olfactory dendrites likely accounting for long-standing anosmia [51]. In addition, persistent inflammation evidenced by elevated levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), type I interferon (IFN), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) within the olfactory epithelium, secondary to invasion, appears to contribute to long-standing anosmia [52]. Altogether, SARS-CoV-2 invasion of supportive cells and subsequent long-lasting local inflammation causes irreversible damage to the olfactory epithelium and are thus the main drivers of persistent hyposmia, anosmia, and dysgeusia.",
            "The invasion of the olfactory epithelium by SARS-CoV-2, however, does not necessarily serve as a window of opportunity for neuroinvasion. Although early in vitro and in vivo studies may suggest the possibility for neuroinvasion of the CNS in the pathogenesis of disease in long COVID, they are limited by neuropathological evidence for SARS-CoV-2 in the brain parenchyma or CSF of patients. Additionally, anatomical barriers to neuroinvasion, such as the perineurial olfactory nerve fibroblasts that wrap olfactory axon fascicles and the added absence of ACE2 receptors for entry on olfactory neurons [51], further call into question the feasibility for this mechanism of pathogenesis. Thus, to this date, there has not been a validated demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 invasion of, and replication in, the CNS.",
            "Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral shedding has been shown to persist in the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium for a median of 30.9 days and 32.5 days, respectively, in severe COVID-19 [53,54]. Due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to cause persistent symbiont depletion and gut dysbiosis in the GI tract [55], prolonged viral shedding maintains microbiome perturbations, likely resulting in brain–gut axis dysfunction [56]. Additional evidence of brain–gut axis alteration from a co-expression analysis in SARS-CoV-2-infected human intestinal organoids revealed ACE2 co-regulation of dopa-decarboxylase (DDC) and clusters of genes involved in the dopamine metabolic pathway and absorption of amino acid precursors to neurotransmitters (Figure 1) [57]. Thus, the involvement of gut dysbiosis and brain–gut axis alterations that persist due to continual viral shedding have been suggested as a possible mechanism in neurological manifestations of long COVID [7].",
            "Aside from SARS-CoV-2 viral persistence, reactivation of viruses of the herpesviridae family, including Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), have also been well documented in long COVID patients. EBV and VZV, a lymphotropic gammaherpesvirus and neurotrophic alphaherpesvirus respectively, can independently affect more than 90% of people worldwide [58,59]. Both viruses can remain latent in host cells after primary infection (in memory B cells in EBV and the neurons of sensory ganglia in VZV) such that the onset of a stressor, such as another acute viral infection, can lead to the reactivation of these herpes viruses and cause inflammation and neurological symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 can act as that stressor and precipitate reactivation of other viruses in COVID-19 and long COVID symptomatology.",
            "According to an early retrospective study of acute COVID patients post-hospitalization, 25% of patients with severe disease had increased serological titers of early antigen IgG (EA-IgG) and viral capsid antigen IgG (VCA-IgG) which serve as proxy markers for reactivation of EBV [60]. More specific to long COVID, a survey study found that two thirds of patients with symptoms 90 days after primary SARS-CoV-2 infection were positive for EBV reactivation, which was also indicated by positive titers of VCA-IgG and early antigen-diffuse IgG (EA-D IgG) [61]. Higher frequency of long COVID symptoms experienced by patients were also significantly correlated with increased EA-IgG titers. Similarly, a longitudinal study of 309 patients tracked from primary infection to convalescence revealed EBV viremia to be one of the four main risk factors for developing long COVID symptoms, with the other three being type II diabetes, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, and autoantibodies formation [20]. EBV reactivation has been specifically associated with memory and fatigue in long COVID. Apart from COVID-19, the immune response to EBV reactivation has been shown to reflect that of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) which could link EBV viremia to the development of ME/CFS-like symptoms in long COVID [62,63]. This immune profile has been identified in a cross-sectional study with 215 long COVID patients where there was an elevated antibody reactivity to EBV gp23, gp42, and EA-D which all were correlated with interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-6 producing CD4+ T cells [64].",
            "The same study also identified significant levels of antibody reactivity to the VZV glycoprotein E which was similarly associated with the immune profile mentioned above. VZV manifestations are also common in COVID-19, occurring in about 17.9% of patients mostly and in the form of dermatome rashes, with rare instances of encephalitis-meningitis and vasculitis [65]. Although less prominent in long COVID pathogenesis than EBV reactivation, VZV reactivation can still contribute to neurological symptoms due to its involvement with the CNS.",
            "The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 through viral shedding provides an impetus to the consideration of antiviral drugs as potential long COVID therapies. Antiviral drugs used in the treatment of acute COVID-19, specifically remdesivir, molnupiravir, fluvoxamine and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir combination (Paxlovid), have demonstrated substantial reductions in mortality and hospitalization [66,67]. Unlike its counterparts, nirmatrelvir is a highly specific competitive inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2-3CL protease and therefore of its viral replication. Ritonavir increases the bioavailability of nirmatrelvir by preventing its hepatic metabolism [68]. An RCT in high-risk non-hospitalized adults with acute COVID-19 showed that Paxlovid reduced viral load rapidly (by day five) as well as mortality and hospitalization (Table 1) [67]. Paxlovid may be vital in reducing neurological symptoms of long COVID, secondary to viral load/shedding, such as persistent cognitive impairment and insomnia. In a recent study (preprint), Xie et al. compared patients who received no antiviral or antibody treatment during acute COVID-19 infection (N = 47,123) with those treated with oral nirmatrelvir within five days of a positive COVID-19 test (N = 9217). Compared with the controls, patients acutely treated with nirmatrelvir had substantially lower risk of developing long COVID symptoms [69]. Their definition of long COVID symptomatology involved 12 outcomes, including myalgia and neurocognitive impairment [69]. While the exact indications for its use in long COVID patients remain to be defined by RCT protocols (Table 2, NCT05576662), Paxlovid demonstrates promise. We posit that Paxlovid may be useful in reducing persistent viral shedding from infected epithelium, and can therefore reduce mechanisms secondary to SARS-CoV-2 invasion such as the previously mentioned gut dysbiosis and inflammation of the olfactory mucosa.",
            "The use of antivirals to address the issue of viral reactivation in long COVID, including treatments for herpesviruses such as acyclovir and valacyclovir, has been documented but their efficacy in alleviating neurological symptoms of long COVID have yet to be assessed [65]. One retrospective study in Wuhan assessed 28-day mortality outcomes for 88 COVID-19 patients with EBV reactivation that were treated with ganciclovir compared with those of matched controls [60]. Ganciclovir treated patients had a significantly higher survival rate than controls, however, specific neurological symptoms were not assessed. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of antivirals specific to herpesvirus reactivation in long COVID patients.",
            "In addition to the specific use of antivirals, other agents, such as cannabidiol, may have some antiviral efficacy as a therapy for long COVID. It is known that the active metabolite in cannabidiol, 7-OH-CBD, can block SARS-CoV-2 replication by inhibiting viral gene expression, upregulating interferon expression, and promoting antiviral signaling pathways [76]. Notably, cannabidiol has been reported to downregulate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [77]—key enzymes involved in the SARS-CoV-2 virus invasion process and the potential evolution to long COVID. A phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04997395) has begun looking into the feasibility of using cannabidiol as a treatment for long COVID (Table 2). Additionally, Cannabidiol has been shown to induce neuroprotective effects [78,79]. Taken together, this suggests that cannabidiol can help ameliorate the neurological symptoms of long COVID, although future clinical trials are needed to provide further evidence.",
            "Regeneration of olfactory mucosa occurred with administration of intranasal insulin in non-COVID-19 patients. Insulin, through its action as a phosphodiesterase enzyme inhibitor, can increase cyclic adenylate monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanylate monophosphate (cGMP) levels by interacting with the nitric oxide cycle [80]. These growth factors are known to stimulate the olfactory epithelium and promote regeneration [80]. In their pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a small population (N = 38), Rezaian et al. assessed the success of twice weekly intranasal protamine insulin gel foam therapy (vs. normal saline placebo) on patients with mild to severe post-infectious hyposmia (Table 1) [74]. They determined that olfaction (via Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Centre score) at four weeks was notably better in the insulin treated groups (5.0 ± 0.7) versus the placebo group (3.8 ± 1.1, p < 0.05) [74]. A larger trial in COVID-19 patients is ongoing (Table 2, NCT05104424). More novel interventions have also demonstrated promise. Indeed, 40 patients with anosmia post COVID-19 infection were randomized to either intranasal insulin film vs. normal saline (placebo). At 30 min after administration, patients in the treatment group had significantly greater odor detection compared with both their baseline and the placebo group [73]. Although RCTs with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up are necessary, these findings are promising in treating persistent anosmia in long COVID.",
            "Due to the damaging effects of local inflammation on the olfactory epithelium, corticosteroids have been used in certain patients to hasten the recovery and repopulation of the olfactory epithelium [71,81]. In 2021, an RCT of mometasone nasal spray, which included one hundred COVID-19 patients with post-infection anosmia, assigned patients to two treatment branches: mometasone furoate nasal spray with olfactory training for three weeks (N = 50) or the control group with only olfactory training (N = 50). There was no significant difference in duration of smell loss, from anosmia onset to self-reported complete recovery, between groups (p = 0.31). However, a significant improvement in smell score was recorded in both groups by week three [71]. Despite this, Singh et al. were able to demonstrate significant improvements in smell (on day five) compared with baseline (day one) using fluticasone nasal spray compared with no intervention (Table 1) [70].",
            "It should be noted that many agents for the treatment of postinfectious hyposmia have been studied previously for non-COVID-19 patients including pentoxifylline, caffeine, theophylline, statins, minocycline, zinc, intranasal vitamin A, omega-3, and melatonin. An in-depth evaluation of their use in non-COVID-19 anosmia is outside the scope of this review. However, in their detailed systematic review, Khani et al. posit that different combinations of the above agents may be of use in long COVID depending on the etiology (viral invasion vs. inflammatory damage) [81].",
            "With a unique range of immune cell phenotypes, chemokine and cytokine production, and inflammatory molecules, the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been widely investigated to rationalize some of the neurological symptoms of long COVID. Although autoantibody generation has been proposed, this inflammatory response has been better characterized with persistent systemic inflammation leading to expansion of monocyte subsets and T cell dysregulation, which in turn is associated with BBB dysfunction, neural glial cell reactivity, and subcortical white matter demyelination (Figure 2).",
            "After SARS-CoV-2 infection, a variety of systemic inflammatory processes are upregulated, and specific immune cell populations are expanded; this disturbance of the peripheral immune system can persist for many months after the infection, which can lead to neurological symptoms. Broadly speaking, when compared with healthy controls, recovered COVID-19 individuals exhibited differences in the populations of innate immune cells, such as natural killer cells, mast cells, and C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3+ (CXCR3+) macrophages, as well as adaptive immune cells, such as T-helper cells and regulatory T cells ([82], p. 2). With non-naive phenotypes, these cells tend to secrete and be activated by increased levels of cytokines and inflammatory markers, including, but not limited, to interferon β (IFN-β), interferon λ1 (IFN-λ1), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), CXCL10, interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-6, and interleukin 17 (IL-17) [83,84]. Several studies have drawn a striking similarity between the symptomatology of long COVID and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), wherein aberrant mast cell activation promotes excessive release of inflammatory mediators, such as type 1 IFNs, and cytokine activation of microglia [85,86]. Triggered by viral entry, these mast cells are commonly found at tissue–environment interfaces and may contribute to persistent systemic inflammation microvascular dysfunction with CNS disturbances in long COVID [85,86]. SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses have also been described to have increased breadth and magnitude. These signature T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 increase with higher viral loads, indicated by significantly elevated levels of nucleocapsid-specific interferon gamma (IFN-γ) producing CD8+ cells in serum samples of patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity [87,88].",
            "Furthermore, a study using flow cytometry on the peripheral blood of long COVID patients detected elevated expansion of non-classical monocytes (CD14dimCD16+) and intermediate monocytes (CD14+CD16+) up to 15 months post infection when compared with healthy controls [89]. Physiologically, non-classical monocytes are involved in complement-mediated and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis against viral insults and are commonly found along the luminal side of vascular endothelium, thereby contributing to BBB integrity. For example, severe long COVID patients were found to have increased levels of macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1), signifying a high degree of peripheral macrophage activation that can in turn disrupt the BBB and cause tissue damage [90]. Alternatively, intermediate monocytes specialize in antigen presentation and simultaneous secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although this marked systemic hyperinflammatory state has not been shown to directly cause neuropsychiatric manifestations, it may contribute to disease progression via chronic activation of specific monocyte and T cell populations and neurovascular dysfunction of the BBB. These mechanisms can result in the spread of inflammatory molecules and immune cells from the periphery into the CNS, inducing a persistent neuroinflammatory response.",
            "With several parallels to the described systemic inflammation, the CNS exhibits persisting trends of monocyte expansion and T cell exhaustion after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the latter of which refers to T cells adopting a distinct cytokine profile with poor effector function. Similar to systemic trends, monocyte expansion in the CNS refers to an increase in the population of non-classical monocytes (CD14dimCD16+) and intermediate monocytes (CD14+CD16+) in CSF of long COVID patients [91,92]. Indeed, monocyte pools analyzed in long COVID patients exhibit a reduction of classical monocytes, indicated by lower levels of pan-monocytic markers and CNS border-associated macrophage phenotypes [91]. While the function of monocytes may be less understood in a chronic disease setting, the expansion of monocyte subsets with antiviral and antigen-presenting phenotypes may be implicated in long COVID symptoms due to its role in BBB disruption and neuroinflammation.",
            "As a result of chronic stimulation by antigens, T cells can assume a distinct cytokine profile with increased inhibitory transcription factor expression and decreased effector function, a process termed exhaustion. More common in CD8+ T cells, this signature process implicates phenotypic and functional defects that can limit T cell functional responsiveness in clearing infection in chronic settings [93]. Persisting for months post infection to prevent recurring illness, CD8+ memory T cells in serum samples of long COVID patients were found to increase in number with higher levels of cytolytic granule expression but with limited breadth and reduced antigen-specific activation [94]. Although the secretion of cytolytic granzymes, IL-6, and nucleocapsid-specific IFN-γ increase in long COVID, these T cells present with limited polyfunctionality and decreased diversity of effector expression; this altered profile was strongly associated with symptoms of depression and decreased executive function [94]. Regarding localization, this population of T cells producing higher granzyme levels can be seen in certain anatomic niches, such as in microglial nodules which are hotspots for immune response activation [95]. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells also congregate near vasculature and produce a surge of cytokines that disrupts the BBB, causing vascular leakage and the propagation of inflammation [95,96]. Evidence against T cell expansion and exhaustion also exists, as one immunophenotyping study shows that persistent T cell changes and neurological deficits are associated with age rather than ongoing illness and fatigue [92].",
            "In summary, though there is a degree of heterogeneity in respect to inflammatory molecules and immune cell populations, long COVID patients with neurological symptoms exhibit persistent systemic inflammation with pronounced differences in circulating myeloid and lymphocyte populations, including prominent peripheral B cell activation with a greater humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 [64]. Elevated levels of non-classical monocytes and intermediate monocytes can bring about altered vascular homeostasis and chronic inflammatory processes, which are largely mediated by Th1 cytokines. Increased amounts of exhausted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with decreased central memory CD4+ T cells implicate a distinct immunological signature with decreased effector function and resulting aberrant immune engagement [64].",
            "Autoantibody generation has been hypothesized to contribute to the persisting abnormal immunological response observed post infection. Rather than being caused by the virus directly, the autoimmune antibody reaction is suggested to be a product of the pronounced immune and inflammatory reaction [22,97]. The serologically detected autoantibodies can be categorized into antibodies against extracellular, cell surface and membrane, or intracellular targets, which include immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against cytokines [98], angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (anti-ACE2) [99], and nuclear proteins (ANA), respectively [100].",
            "Following activation of B cells in the periphery and cytokine abnormalities, these serologic IgG and IgA antibodies exhibit a polyclonal distribution, affect cytokine function and endothelial integrity, and can enter the CNS given the BBB disruption [90]. Although there are limited reports, these autoimmune responses have been proposed to be present with acute-onset encephalitis, seizures, meningitis, polyradiculitis, myelopathy, and neuropsychiatric symptoms [101,102,103,104,105]. Persistent ANA autoreactivity has been linked with long-term symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and brain fog seen in long COVID [106]. Anti-ACE2 antibodies, which are associated with fatigue and myelitis, can elicit an abnormal renin–angiotensin response, cause malignant hypertension-related ischemia and upregulate thrombo-inflammatory pathways [97]. While these antibodies have been associated with neurological manifestations after SARS-CoV-2 infection, they have also been limited to parainfection and acute post-infection time periods. Furthermore, small studies have reported the lack of autoantibodies in acute COVID-19 patients presenting with encephalitis [107]. More convincingly, a recent exploratory, cross sectional study illustrated that despite patients exhibiting an array of autoantigen reactivities, the total levels of autoantibodies were definitively not elevated in the extracellular proteome of patients with long COVID compared with convalescent controls [64].",
            "Perhaps sparked by previous demonstrations of peripheral B cell activation, research supporting autoantibody generation in the neurological manifestations of long COVID have been mostly limited to various case reports and studies that, due to sample size and timescale constraints, have limited generalizability. Though autoantibodies can drive inflammation, neuronal dysfunction, and subsequent neurodegeneration, which are all observed in long COVID, this mechanism is not as well understood and warrants further investigations to implicate it in the pathogenesis of long COVID.",
            "Control of inflammation post-infection may attenuate persistent cytokine release, immune cell activation, and the pronounced neural immune response, thereby alleviating neurological symptoms of long COVID. Support for this rationale derives from the studies that showed lower prevalence of long COVID in those with less robust inflammatory and immune responses to acute infection, such as vaccinated patients [69,108] and those treated with antivirals [109,110]. Here, we review several promising anti-inflammatory therapies for those with long COVID.",
            "A currently recruiting double-blinded placebo-controlled RCT assessing the efficacy of oral lithium (10 mg daily) aims to determine if fatigue, brain fog, anxiety and cognitive outcome scores improve after three weeks of lithium therapy (NCT05618587). Despite the anti-inflammatory effects of lithium, good CNS penetrance, and efficacy in reducing inflammation in patients with acute COVID-19 [111], lithium’s efficacy and benefit–risk profile in patients with long COVID and neurological symptoms have not been proven.",
            "RSLV-132 is a novel RNase fusion protein that digests ribonucleic acid contained in autoantibodies and immune complexes generated by the humoral immune response. Therefore, RSLV-132 has applications in both autoimmune disease and post-viral syndromes caused by autoantibody generation, such as long COVID. When compared with the placebo in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome, RSLV-132 decreased fatigue, which was assessed using Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT), Fatigue Visual Analogue Score, and Profile of Fatigue Score at week 14 [112]. The phase 2 clinical trial of RSLV-132 (NCT04944121) follows patients 10 weeks after the start of treatment and assesses fatigue using Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS), FACIT scores and long COVID symptoms via questionnaires. The precise indication for RSLV-132 requires further study, as patients with long COVID may have sub-threshold or absent autoantibody levels as previously mentioned [107].",
            "RCTs assessing the efficacy of conventional anti-inflammatory agents, such as steroids or IV immunoglobulin, are ongoing: one upcoming trial involves the randomized treatment of patients with either IV methylprednisolone, IV immunoglobulin or IV saline (NCT05350774). Depression, anxiety, and cognitive assessment scores will be compared at the end of the three-month (minimum) follow-up period. Ongoing RCTs of anti-inflammatory agents are summarized in Table 2.",
            "Additionally, brain fog and fatigue, which are the most prevalent neurological symptoms of long COVID [5], might arise from the prolonged neuroinflammation secondary to the innate immune activation (immune cell migration across the BBB and chemokine release) and humoral activation (autoantibody generation) described above. While current trials are investigating various agents that control the systemic inflammation discussed above, dextroamphetamine–amphetamine (NCT05597722) may be suitable for use in long COVID patients to improve brain fog, given its use in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. In a similar vein, low-dose naltrexone has shown promise in improving brain fog and fatigue (self-reported via questionnaire) [72]; an upcoming placebo-controlled RCT (NCT05430152) will provide greater clarity on its efficacy. Along with other mast cell mediator blockers and stabilizers used in MCAS that target mast cell overactivation and subsequent inflammation, antihistamine treatment via a combined histamine H1/H2 receptor blockade has been associated with significant symptomatic improvement in long COVID patients according to a recent observational study [75]. However, further studies are required to determine the optimal patients for the above interventions.",
            "One of the most prominent hypothesized mechanisms of long COVID symptomatology involves the activation of the neuroimmune system through the interplay of neural cells and glial cells, namely astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. Astrocytes are critical for CNS homeostasis as they play roles in neuron–glial cell interaction, synaptic function, and blood–brain barrier integrity. Microglia are fundamental for processes of innate immunity within the CNS and are central to synaptic function, maintaining neural networks, and supporting homeostatic repair mechanisms upon injury to the micro-environment. However, with altered cytokine activity and brain injury, glial cells can become overactivated. Evidenced by increased levels of ezrin (EZR) in long COVID patients, these reactive astrocytes upregulate NF-κB, which can cause endothelial cell death and increase extracellular glutamate, resulting in BBB disruption and hyperexcitability-induced neurodegeneration, respectively [90,113,114,115]. Similarly, it is suspected that reactive microglia lose their plasticity-promoting function and facilitate disruption of neural circuitry with the release of microglial cytokines.",
            "Patients with neurological symptoms of long COVID were also found to have increased levels of the C-C motif chemokine ligand 11 (CCL11), an immunoregulatory chemokine that can recruit eosinophils, cross the BBB, induce microglial migration, disrupt hippocampal neurogenesis, and cause cognitive dysfunction (e.g., brain fog) [45,116]. Decreased ramification of microglia is partially stimulated by CCL11, causing the release of microglial cytokines and the death of vulnerable neuroglial cells, such as the myelinating oligodendrocytes which assist in the tuning of neural circuitry and the provision of metabolic support to axons. Mouse models and brain tissue samples of long COVID patients have shown extensive white matter-selective microglial and astrocytic reactivity, with subsequent loss of oligodendrocytes and subcortical white matter demyelination (Figure 2). As a result, circuit integrity may be compromised, thereby leading to persisting neurological symptoms [116]. Moreover, novel brain organoid models have demonstrated marked microgliosis 72 h post infection with upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes and microglial phagocytosis leading to engulfment of nerve termini and synapse elimination [117]. This observed postsynaptic destruction may persist along with chronic microglial reactivity to further propagate neurodegeneration in long COVID. Lastly, the most severe long COVID patients exhibited increased levels of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 11b (TNFRSF11B), an osteoblast-secreted decoy receptor that has been implicated in neuroinflammatory processes and in contributing to microglia overstimulation [90]. Associated with a variety of symptoms, such as cognitive dysfunction, poor psychomotor coordination, and working memory deficits, this mechanism of neural cell reactivity is not specific to COVID-19 and is in fact, strikingly similar to cancer therapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) [116].",
            "The pathogenesis and neurological manifestations of long COVID implicate disturbances of neuroglial cells with resulting glial cell reactivity that can be localized to specific brain regions, such as the olfactory bulb, brainstem, and basal ganglia [45]. With persistent cytokine abnormalities and brain injury, reactive neuroglia can influence vascular and endothelial function, compromising the integrity of the BBB, and cause neurodegeneration with marked increases in extracellular glutamate leading to toxic hyperexcitability. Reactive microglia respond to increased levels of CCL11 and release microglial cytokines that can damage neural circuitry. This overactive state of microgliosis leads to a decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis, which is linked with deficits in memory and cognitive function, as well as the death of myelinating oligodendrocytes alongside white-matter selective demyelination. In summary, the most consistent neuropathological observation in all autopsy-based studies of COVID-19 patients is the prominent astroglial and microglial over-reactivity. At present, with the exception of a few anecdotal case reports, there are no neuropathological studies of long COVID conditions. Nevertheless, the neuroglial disturbances and ensuing cytotoxicity appear to facilitate persistent inflammation and subsequent axonal dysfunction in the CNS environment, leading to attention deficits, brain fog, fatigue, and anosmia [45,95].",
            "COVID-19 is known to increase the risk for hemorrhages, ischemic infarcts, and hypoxic changes in the CNS during the acute phase of infection, implicating endotheliopathy and coagulopathy as important mechanisms of pathogenesis [46]. Although these neurological symptoms are not observed in high frequency among long COVID patients, small vessel thromboses (microclots) and microvascular dysfunction due to persisting mechanisms of endotheliopathy and coagulopathy could account for the neurological symptoms of long COVID that are associated with cerebrovascular disease and hypoxic-neuronal injury (Figure 3) [63].",
            "A major mechanism of thrombosis in long COVID involves a unique signature of fibrinolysis-resistant, large anomalous amyloid microclot formation present in the serum of patients with long COVID [118]. Thioflavin T staining and microscopy have determined the size of these microclots to reach upwards of 200 µm, which can adequately occlude microcapillaries, reducing cerebral blood flow and causing ischemic neuronal injury [118,119]. Microclot formation occurs due to the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with fibrinogen, which causes increased clot density, spike-enhanced release of reactive oxygen species, fibrin-induced inflammation at sites of vascular damage, and delayed fibrinolysis [119,120,121]. Additionally, interaction of the nine-residue segment SK9 located on the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein with serum amyloid A (SAA) increases fibril formation and stability, thus contributing to the amyloid nature of the microclots [122]. Proteomics pairwise analysis of digested microclot samples from long COVID patients revealed significantly elevated levels of fibrinogen alpha chains and SAA which both contribute to fibrinolysis resistance and subsequent microclot persistence (Figure 3) [118]. The same study also revealed that the inflammatory molecule α2-antiplasmin (α2AP), a potent inhibitor of plasmin, was significantly elevated in microclots from long COVID patients in comparison with patients with acute COVID; likely contributing to an aberrant fibrinolytic system in addition to anomalous microclot formation [118].",
            "Hypercoagulability can also be precipitated by prothrombotic autoantibody formation in long COVID. Prothrombotic autoantibodies targeting phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins (aPLs), including anticardiolipin, anti-beta2 glycoprotein I, and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin, were found to be present in 52% of serum samples of patients hospitalized with acute COVID-19 [123]. It is currently hypothesized that aPLs can form through molecular mimicry, neoepitope formation, or both [124]. The S1 and S2 subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could form a phospholipid-like epitope as a mechanism of molecular mimicry or, alternatively, oxidative stress due to SARS-CoV-2 may lead to the conformational change of beta2-glycoprotein I as a way of neoepitope generation. These proposed mechanisms can both result in aPL formation; however, in-vitro experimentation is needed to verify these pathologies in long COVID [124,125]. Antiphospholipid antibodies are then able to cause thrombosis through either the induction of adhesion molecule and tissue factor expression or the upregulation of IL-6, interleukin 8 (IL-8), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and nitric oxide synthase [124]. However, studies specific to these mechanisms have not yet been undertaken in the setting of long COVID. Alternatively, COVID-19-specific mechanisms of aPL-induced thrombosis include elevated platelet counts and neutrophil hyperactivity [123]. Specifically, IgG was purified from serum of COVID-19 patients with high titers of aPL and added to cultured neutrophils, increasing neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release (Figure 3) [123]. With the persistence of the S1 subunit of the spike protein within CD16+ monocytes for up to 15 months post-infection as an epitope for aPL generation [89], aPL levels can remain elevated in long COVID.",
            "It is still important, however, to take into account the previously mentioned insignificant autoantibody generation to the exoproteome in long COVID patients when considering the role of aPL in disease pathogenesis [64]. Thus, the interplay between anomalous microclot formation, fibrinolytic system dysfunction, and possible aPL formation likely contribute to persistent coagulopathies leading to ischemic neuronal injury in long COVID.",
            "Persistent endotheliopathy, independent of the acute COVID-19 response, has been implicated in BBB disruption and neurovascular injury. Levels of plasma markers for endotheliopathy, including von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen, VWF propeptide, soluble thrombomodulin, and endothelial colony-forming cells, remained elevated in a cohort of patients assessed at a median of 68 days post-infection [126,127]. This prolonged endotheliopathy in long COVID can be attributed to the sustained effect by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) proinflammatory cytokines [128], complement activation by immunoglobulin complexes [129], oxidative stress evidenced by elevated malondialdehyde levels [130], or by direct viral invasion of endothelial cells [113]. With regards to the immune-mediated processes, although cytokines themselves can directly activate endothelial cells, immune complexes positive for IgG and immunoglobulin M (IgM) at the vascular wall of post-mortem tissue of patients with acute COVID-19 were co-localized with membrane attack complexes (MAC) composed of activated C5b-9 complement factors [129]. The presence of MAC, paired with the previously mentioned evidence of autoantibodies to ACE2 receptors on endothelial cell surfaces [99], could very well lead to endothelial cell death. Additionally, in regards to viral invasion of endothelial cells, in vitro and in vivo experiments have elucidated the ability of SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro to cleave NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) in endothelial cells (Figure 3), resulting in cell death, empty basement membrane tube formation (also known as string vessels), and BBB dysfunction in mice [130].",
            "BBB dysfunction has been hypothesized to be at the center of the mechanisms of long-term COVID complications. BBB alterations in permeability after addition of extracted SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been observed in microfluidic models, likely due to endotheliopathy from a pro-inflammatory response [131]. The resulting BBB permeability and microvascular injury have been indicated by perivascular leakage of fibrinogen and persistent capillary rarefaction in an autopsy and a sublingual video microscopy study of long COVID patients, respectively [129,132]. BBB dysfunction can then allow for infiltration of immune cells and cytokines from the systemic circulation that can then propagate neuroinflammation mechanisms in the CNS. Notably, the same autopsy study revealed perivascular invasion of CD68+ macrophages and CD8+ T cells (Figure 3) along with notable reactive astrogliosis which might serve a currently unidentified role in perpetuating BBB leakage [129]. This loss of BBB function is thought to be more pronounced in areas of the cerebellum and brainstem, where most pathological abnormalities have been found with prominent hypometabolism in the bilateral pons, medulla, and cerebellum of long COVID patients (Figure 1) [45,46,133]. The increased permeability at the blood and CNS interface could allow for microglial activation by systemic inflammation evidenced by the presence of microglial nodules associated with neuronophagia and neuronal loss in the hindbrain of patients with acute COVID-19 [129], likely accounting for the persisting hypometabolic pathology. Subsequent neuronal degeneration and brainstem dysfunction could explain the similarities between long COVID symptoms and ME/CFS since the association between severity of ME/CFS symptoms and brainstem dysfunction has been elucidated in previous imaging studies [134,135,136,137]. Together, all endothelial-associated mechanisms can lead to the spread of inflammatory cytokines and immune cells into the CNS, infected leukocyte extravasation across the BBB, and microhemorrhage, ultimately contributing to underlying neurological and cognitive symptoms in long COVID. Current interventions that aim to ameliorate risk of thrombotic complications are not COVID-19 specific, however, due to the implication of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in endotheliopathy, the role of nirmatrelvir or Paxlovid as Mpro inhibitors could possibly lessen BBB dysfunction. Still, a pharmacological challenge remains in demonstrating the benefit of traditional anticoagulation in patients with long COVID.",
            "Neurological manifestations of long COVID exist as a major complication of COVID-19 post-infection, affecting up to one third of patients with COVID symptoms lasting longer than four weeks. Although SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, viral-induced coagulopathy, endothelial disruption, systemic inflammation, cytokine overactivation and neuroglial dysfunction have been hypothesized as mechanisms associated with pathogenesis of long COVID condition, further clinical, neuropathological, and experimental models are needed to address many of the unknown questions about pathogenesis. Similarly, current and potential therapeutics to target these hypothesized pathogenic mechanisms using anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and neuro-regenerative agents are potentially able to reverse neurological sequelae but still require well designed clinical trials studies to prove their efficacy.",

            "Neuroinvasion and persistent viral shedding. SARS-CoV-2 employs the ACE2 receptor to invade the stem cells, perivascular cells, sustentacular cells, and Bowman’s gland cells in the olfactory epithelium; this leads to chronic thinning of filia and loss of olfactory bulb volume. Additionally, there is an association between areas of hypometabolism in the cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem with the spatial distribution of ACE2 receptors, though there is little evidence for direct neuroinvasion in these areas. Rather, it is hypothesized that these regions experience elevated levels of microglial activation, cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration and demyelination secondary to neuroinvasion. These mechanisms likely persist due to the chronic presence of viral shedding specifically in the gastrointestinal tract where there exists ACE2 co-regulation of DDC and involvement of the dopamine metabolic pathway. Figure was created with the BioRender software.",
            "Systemic and neurological immune response. The systemic immune and inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection can continue for months after the acute recovery phase, inducing a state of persistent systemic inflammation with upregulated cytokines, such as IFN-β, IFN-λ1, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL10. This prolonged cytokine release has been linked to activation of specific immune cell populations, such as non-classical and intermediate monocytes, as well as other cell types, such as fibroblasts and myeloid cells. From an aberrant Th2 cytokine pool, production of CCL11 is induced and leads to neuroinflammation with activation of resting microglia, which can further release increased levels of CCL11. This microglial reactivity can in turn cause reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, loss of myelinating oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursors, and ensuing subcortical white matter demyelination. These systemic and neurological mechanisms have been strongly associated with a range of cognitive impairments and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Figure was created with the BioRender software.",
            "Blood–brain barrier disruption and microclot formation. SARS-CoV-2 can cause increased microclot formation through spike protein interactions with fibrinogen and serum protein A that promote fibril formation and resist fibrinolysis. Antiphospholipid antibodies are also present in long COVID and can precipitate microclot formation through IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, nitric oxide synthase, and NET release. These microclots also contain α2AP which inhibit plasmin and thus prevent the degradation of fibrin, further contributing to their fibrinolysis-resistant nature. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 can induce BBB disruption through Mpro cleavage of NEMO in endothelial cells leading to cell death and string vessel formation.

            "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a severe multiorgan pathology which, besides cardio-respiratory manifestations, affects the function of the central nervous system (CNS). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), similarly to other coronaviruses demonstrate neurotropism; the viral infection of the brain stem may complicate the course of the disease through damaging central cardio-respiratory control. The systemic inflammation as well as neuroinflammatory changes are associated with massive increase of the brain pro-inflammatory molecules, neuroglial reactivity, altered neurochemical landscape and pathological remodelling of neuronal networks. These organic changes, emerging in concert with environmental stress caused by experiences of intensive therapy wards, pandemic fears and social restrictions, promote neuropsychiatric pathologies including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder (BD), various psychoses, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. The neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 represent serious clinical challenge that has to be considered for future complex therapies.",
            "Human civilisation has always co-existed with parasitic forms of life represented by bacteria and viruses that invariably took the toll of life. When social, biological and economic factors aligned, the infections became widespread reaching the level of pandemic, which caused massive death and misery; pandemics shaken the foundations of society and turned the course of history and mindset of humanity. The typhoid fever devastated Athens in 490 BC thus giving the military society of Sparta upper hand in Peloponnesian war, the Plague of Justinian doomed the reincarnation of Roman empire, while the Black Death, caused by Yersinia pestis that killed a third of population of Europe, instigated tectonic changes in economic relations that ultimately disposed of serfdom and feudalism and laid foundations of Renaissance. The last global epidemic of Spanish flu responsible for 20–50 millions deaths has coincided with First World War, internecine conflicts and birth of bolshevism, which all together brought the greatest confusion to mankind. Movements of great masses of soldiers from the US brought the H1N1 influenza A virus to Europe; disruption of the health services, poor hygiene associated with movements of people, devastations of war and malnutrition all sparkled the superinfection with unusually high death toll1.",
            "All major pandemic, being associated with severe environmental stress, affected human way of thinking and human psychological health. Systematic studies aimed at identifying pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for the onset of psychiatric diseases following viral epidemics begun in 19 century. The eminent English doctor, Henry Holland in 1839 proclaimed that the flu was responsible “of featured impairments of mental functions almost in the same ratio of the body ……. and that the behavioural alterations were not comparable to those secondary to other fevers”1. Eighty years later Karl Menniger confirmed the association between viral infection and psychiatric morbidity: “one hundred cases of mental disease associated with influenza in the recent pandemic have been studied at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital. The variety of mental disturbance manifested is wide… they are readily classifiable into four groups: delirium, dementia praecox, other psychoses, and unclassified. Of these, dementia praecox is the largest group numerically” 2.",
            "Over the years the accumulated clinical evidence has strengthened our knowledge of psychiatric features of cerebral disease. In the past few decades the interest in the putative aetiologic role of viruses has gradually enhanced to enclose not only the organic mental disorders induced by acute viral encephalitis and the slow viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) but also to encompass the so-called functional psychiatric diseases such psychosis, depression and bipolar disorder (BD). It has became universally acknowledged that combination of systemic infection, viral neurotropism and environmental stress facilitates or even induces development of psychiatric pathologies that exacerbate the course of pandemic and present a significant therapeutic challenge.",
            "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic revives a long-forgotten challenge for humanity that lived in (illusionary) mass infection free environment. Grappling with the uncertainties of a newly emerged disease, against which neither vaccine nor effective treatment protocol exists, the mankind will likely subsist in a new reality for months if not years before implementation of a global remedy. How the virus interacts with our body and which are the pathophysiological scenarios for acute phase of the disease and long-lasting outcomes are the critical questions to be addressed to identify medical strategies.",
            "The COVID-19 results from the infection with a novel coronavirus that was first identified in China following an initial outbreak in 20192. This coronavirus, named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to group 2B of β-coronavirus family3. The SARS-CoV-2 is recognised as the seventh component of the coronavirus family and has been included in the orthocoronavirinae subfamily4. Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses generally related to respiratory illness; they also (albeit less frequently) may instigate gastrointestinal and neurological disorders in a wide variety of mammals and birds. The coronaviruses have high rates of mutation and recombination as well as a propensity of cross-species transmission5. The SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell following binding to plasmalemmal ACE2 enzyme with subsequent endocytic internalisation6,7. The primary targets for the virus are represented by epithelial cells of the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Endocytosis of the ACE2-virus complex also leads to a depletion of plasmalemmal pool of ACE2 with consequent reduction in conversion of Angiotensin II to Angiotensin 1–7; the latter peptide possesses marked anti-inflammatory properties8,9 and the reduction of Arg 1–7 significantly contributes to lung failure and the massive occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis described in patients with COVID-1910. Whether SARS-CoV-2 could penetrate cells through alternative routes remains unclear, although in contrast to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 does not bind to plasmalemmal receptors such as aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase11.",
            "The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is dominated by respiratory signs with less frequent occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms. The virus invasion is not limited to these two organs, particularly considering that significant expression of ACE2 is detected in other tissues, including heart, kidney, endothelium and CNS12. Viral infection of the brain13 may have multiple neurological and psychiatric consequences, contributing to both the acute phase of disease and its potential sequelae Fig.1. The neurotropism has been well documented for several β-coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and the HEV 67 N virus of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis14–19. Arguably, the primary way for SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2 expressed in neurones and in neuroglia20–22 The ACE2 expressing neural cells are found in the circumventricular organs, such as the subfornical organ, the paraventricular nucleus, the solitary tract and in the rostral ventrolateral medulla21. All these regions have little protection of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and all are involved in cardiovascular and respiratory regulation. The lack of BBB makes these CNS sites vulnerable in many pathologies, such as various types of systemic inflammation including sepsis-associated encephalopathy, neuroinfection with bacteria, viruses or parasites, stress and autoimmune encephalitis23,24. Microglial cells localised in CVO seems to be in a state of chronic activation in the attempt to limit the entry of circulating neurotoxic molecules or invasive agents into the parenchyma and to preserve cerebral homoeostasis25. The SARS-CoV-2, similarly to other respiratory viruses, could gain access to CNS through several routes, for example by migrating through axons of the olfactory nerve26. The intranasal infection of SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV27 was shown to result in rapid spread of viral particles into the brain possibly through the olfactory bulb by a retrograde axonal transport; viruses replicating in the nasal cavity may utilise the direct link with the olfactory bulb to colonise the CNS. In this paradigm the virus is transported through the axons of olfactory bulb neurones with subsequent infection of the specific type of neuroglia the sustentacular cells of the olfactory bulb28. When the virus was administered intranasally in extremely low doses, only the CNS was disseminated5, strengthening the concept of an intrinsic neurotropism of coronaviruses. In rodents ablation of the olfactory bulb prevented viral spread following nasal infection29. Further support for the role of nasal-olfactory route comes from clinical observations according to which anosmia develops early in SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects30. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present for 20 or more days in oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal secretion samples of 30% of COVID-19 survivors, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can linger for a long time at both upper and lower respiratory tract31.Fig. 1Neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19.The SARS-COV-2 enters the body through various routes and causes systemic and tissue inflammation. Systemic inflammation compromises the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and floods the brain with pro-inflammatory factors. The virus may also cross the BBB at the level of the circumventricular organs or through retrograde axonal transport via olfactory bulb and infect the brain, thus instigating reactive gliosis, which leads to an increased production and secretion of cytokines and other pro-inflammatory factors. The combination of systemic inflammation, hypoxia resulting from respiratory failure and neuroinflammation may trigger or exacerbate psychiatric diseases.",

            "The virus can also enter the brain through infecting endothelial cells lining brain vasculature; an electron-microscopic analysis of the frontal lobe identified SARS-COV-2 viral particles in the endothelium with some indications for virus transit to the neuropil32. The SARS-Cov-2 can enter the CNS using perivascular spaces of the glymphatic system33. Furthermore, viruses can invade the brain through other nerves, such as the trigeminal nerve, which projects nociceptive terminals to nasal cavities34. Similarly, sensory fibres of the vagus nerve, that innervate the respiratory tract, can present another invasion route35. Further evidence of the SARS-CoV-2 neuroinfection, oedema and neuronal degeneration were reported in post-mortem brain samples, while in a case of encephalitis genome sequencing confirmed viral presence in the cerebrospinal fluid36. Post-mortem analysis of nervous tissue from tissue of a 54 years-old man who died from severe respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 identified SARS-COV-2 viral particles in the olfactory nerve, in the gyrus rectus and in the brainstem with signs of profound damage to all elements of the tissue including glial cells, neurones, their axons and myelin37.",
            "It seems therefore that SARS-CoV-2, similarly to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infects the brainstem, in which the respiratory neuronal circuits are located, and, by analogy, a similar infection could occur and contribute to the respiratory failure, observed in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Breathing depends on a central pattern generator located in the dorsolateral pons, in the nucleus of the solitary tract, and in ventrolateral medulla; this patter generator is responsible for respiratory rhythms and control of motor neurones innervating respiratory muscles38,39. In a sub-population of COVID-19 patients’ respiratory failure is manifested by a decreased breathing rate with hypoxia and hypercapnia. Many of these patients remain in a coma for days, despite the suspension of sedative treatment and the absence of apparent metabolic alteration, indicating viral encephalitis, which often is resolved without major sequelae40. This is not always the case, however, and when the extent of respiratory failure is overwhelming, patients die before the virus-induced brain damage can become evident41. Given the viral load in the brain stem, the subsequent reduction of ACE2 expression associated with the neuronal death, could lead to an alteration in baroreceptors function associated with an increase in the sympathetic tone and a severe, life threatening rise in blood pressure42,43. The encephalitis, reported as a complication of coronavirus infection, invariably affects not only the brain stem but also thalamus and white matter26,44,45. These aspects have to be taken in account by clinicians dealing with COVID-19 patients displaying severe cardiovascular and respiratory failure. Recognizing that respiratory symptoms may, at least in part, originate from the encephalitic damage to the brain stem, may help to design more effective treatments.",
            "The damage to the brain stem as well as to other brain structures can also result from systemic inflammation, often referred to as systemic inflammatory response syndrome or “cytokine storm”46,47. At the same time the brain is a target for infectious toxic encephalopathy, associated with systemic toxaemia or hypoxia that accompany acute infectious diseases. Toxic encephalopathies have massive neurological and psychiatric presentations and even cerebral oedema, which however develops without accumulation of inflammatory markers in cerebrospinal fluid48. In addition, systemic infection and high levels of circulating cytokines often damage microcirculation, inducing oedema and thrombosis; the tromboembolia being reported in up to 30% of patients49. The cytokines, furthermore, activate autonomic nerves and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis which affect blood pressure. All these factors together stipulate ischaemic damage to the brain and are associated with occurrence of strokes which further increase mortality in COVID-19 patients50.",
            "Despite the existence of BBB, the brain and the spinal cord communicate with the peripheral immune system, and hence every systemic inflammation affects the CNS51. In the context of COVID-19 the damage to BBB mediated by a massive increase in circulating pro-inflammatory factors is highly likely52. Compromised BBB allows an inflammatory storm to engulf CNS leading to functional damage. Once in the brain, peripheral inflammatory molecules as well as inflammatory cells instigate neuroinflammation thus perturbing homoeostasis, altering neural networks and inducing neuronal death53,54.",
            "In the initial phases of systemic inflammation, antiviral immunity can effectively blunt viral dissemination, since reactivity of neuroglia and influx of surveying T cells can remove infectious elements, preventing spread without any further tissue damage55. In severe COVID-19, substantial release of chemokines and interleukins associated with systemic inflammation and the marked lymphopenia allow higher and a more prolonged persistence of a viral load; consequently deficient clearance of the virus together with the reactive gliosis can perpetuate neuroinflammation56–58. Even in mild cases, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia causes hypoxia, which on its own can trigger or exacerbate inflammatory response of the CNS. Cerebral hypoxia activates key inflammatory transcription factors, including NF-κB and hypoxia inducible factor which stimulate overproduction of pro-inflammatory messengers59, trigger glial reactivity60,61, induce mitochondrial oxidative damage, and activate promoter region of numerous miRNAs, crucial for regulating gene expression during inflammation62. An excessive glial reactivity due to persistent exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines also contributes to synapse loss and neuronal death63,64.",
            "The impact of SARS-COV-2 infection on the brain is associated with excessive physical and psychological stress that stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis thus further exacerbating neuroinflammatory status65. The duration and frequency of exposure to stressors impacts neuroinflammation. In this sense while a response to short and moderate stressors could be beneficial, repeated or extended exposure to strong stressors exacerbates inflammation66. Exposure to long-lasting stress enhances inflammatory response through the release of several pro-inflammatory factors, which trigger down-stream signalling pathways, including NF-κB-dependent transcription. Contribution of glucocorticoids, associated with stress response, to sustaining and promoting neuroinflammation is complex, going beyond effects deriving from the activation of the signals downstream of their receptors67. Microarray experiments demonstrated that glucocorticoids drive expression of specific gene profiles, whereas concurrent co-activation of glucocorticoid receptors and NF-κB-dependent transcription induces a peculiar pattern of gene expression different from the one resulting from separate activation of each signalling pathway68. Neuroinflammation is a significant aetiological factor for a large number of neuropsychiatric and neuro-cognitive diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders69–71, depression72, psychosis73, autism74, drug abuse75, sleep disorders76 and epilepsy77. The neuropsychiatric burden of this pandemic is currently unknown, but is likely to be considerable. Based on the results from investigations of recent epidemics by corona respiratory viruses, SARS-COV-1 and MERS-COV, it is possible to assume that a significant percentage of subjects recovering from pneumonia do not fully regain their previous emotional state and cognitive abilities. Indeed, a study of neuropsychiatric consequences of SARS-COV-1 performed at 30–50 months after the infection demonstrated an occurrence of 40% of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 36.4% of depression, 15.6% of obsessive convulsive disorder, and an equal incidence for anxiety disorders78. Furthermore, a meta-analysis among SARS-COV-1 patients of mixed conditions showed neurocognitive deficits up to 18 months post-discharge79, including mild cognitive impairment80. Given this evidence the burden of long-term post-SARS-CoV-2 delirium and dementia may be notable, especially for elderly subjects who are more vulnerable to post-infectious neurocognitive sequelae. The average age of the subjects with severe COVID-19 is around 63 years, whereas patients under the age of fifty represent only 26% of all clinical cases. The ageing itself is the major risk factor for cognitive pathologies and neurodegeneration; severe systemic diseases as well as stress are known to provoke or accelerate cognitive decline in elderly. In the aged brain the neurogenesis is dwindling, synaptic plasticity deteriorates, metabolism is reduced and overall brain vulnerability to exogenous insults is increased. Ageing of the human brain is also associated with degeneration and atrophy of microglia and astrocytes which diminishes homoeostatic and neuroprotective support and again increases brain susceptibility to pathology81–84. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 (even in moderate clinical cases) thus promotes cognitive disorders with emergence of delirium, acute psychosis, exacerbation of mild cognitive impairment or with accelerating of dementia associated with various neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD)85,86. Conceptually, neuroinflammation contributes to the pathological development of neurodegeneration and often is considered as a common, even unifying feature of neurodegeneration87, while brain infection and ischaemic insults by themselves can trigger neurodegenerative process and instigate dementia88.",
            "It is a truth universally acknowledged that systemic inflammatory challenge accelerates cognitive impairment, which implicates that the infection itself, as well as aberrations of the innate immune system, is responsible for the cognitive deficits89. Epidemiological observations as well as neuropathological analysis support the notion of a direct correlation between systemic infections, neuroinflammation and cognitive disorders, such as delirium and AD90,91. In this context, cohort studies identified pneumonia as the pre-eminent pathology responsible for hastening and boosting cognitive decline92. At the same time vaccinations against bacteria or viruses reduce the risk of the progressive evolution of dementia93. Close correlation between pneumonia and delirium in the elderly is a long-standing observation, and delirium, which represents the most common event of acute brain dysfunction, is a frequent complication of COV-19 clinical progression, perhaps due to the neurovirulence, severe peripheral inflammation, profound stress; even “social distancing” and loneliness which elderly experience during pandemic contribute to psychotic episodes94.",
            "Systemic and tissue immune response contribute to the pathophysiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases through modifying neurochemical environment, synaptic transmission and plasticity, synthesis and secretion of neurotrophic factors, neurogenesis, and brain connectome. In this context, the major depression disorder (MDD) is one of the most frequent neuropsychiatric disorders linked to inflammatory injury to the brain. A large body of evidence has associated depression symptoms to pro-inflammatory factors95 and neuroglial failure96. This link specifically applies to subtypes of depression occurring in the elderly. Ageing substantially affects the levels and the activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CNS. Systemic infection can itself trigger major depression in elderly patients, because of age-dependent decrease of immune homoeostasis97. In particular increased serum levels of interleukin-1β directly correlate with emergence of late life MDD98. Similarly, a correlation has been observed between inflammatory factors and some specific symptoms, for example, high levels of TNF-α and IL-2 associate with apathy and motor inhibition, whereas IL-6 associates with anhedonia and suicidality99. The levels of cytokines decrease when patients recover normal mood levels; conversely cytokines remain elevated in patients resistant to treatment100,101.",
            "Severe cases of COVID-19 are almost invariably accompanied with excessive host immune response, mainly characterised by a massive increase in plasma levels of IL-6, which directly correlates with an unfavourable outcome of the disease102. At the same time abnormally high concentrations of IL-6 were detected in the cerebral spinal fluid of suicide attempters103, of subjects suffering from either depression or schizophrenia104, of old depressed patients105,106 and of mothers with post-partum depression107. A large body of evidence demonstrated that changes in IL-6 levels, both in plasma and in the brain, are implicated in the emergence of depression, although other factors, environmental or genetic in nature, provide an important contribution108. In the CNS IL-6 acts as a pro-inflammatory mediator, which promotes synthesis and secretion of additional inflammatory factors and acute phase proteins by astrocytes and microglia109. Thus IL-6, together with TNF-α and IL-1β, can be considered as one of the primary regulators of the immune response in the brain, while astrocytes and microglia are the major responders to IL-6, as well as prominent producers of IL-6 stimulated by damage and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (including viruses and their components), neurotransmitters and pro-inflammatory messengers63,110–113. Physiological plasma levels of IL-6 in adults range between 1–10 pg/ml whereas in a systemic inflammation is raises to several ng/ml;114 and even higher concentrations were reported for COVID 19115. Incidentally, high levels of IL-6 have been detected in the plasma, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the post-mortem prefrontal cortex of subjects with suicidal ideation, with non-fatal suicide attempts or committed suicides116. At the same time no direct correlation was found between plasma and CSF concentrations of IL-6 in subjects with suicide attempts, nor such correlation was detected for scores of depression severity117. The IL-6 levels in circulation also correlated with suicide endophenotypic behaviours, such as personality trait disorders, aggressivity and impulsivity118. This is in agreement with numerous findings proving the role of cytokines in regulating emotions and behaviours through interacting with specific brain areas and different neuronal pathways119. COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant changes in lifestyle and interpersonal relationships condemning many to prolonged loneliness. These conditions of psychosocial stress can also have a detrimental effect on the most fragile subjects affecting their ability to modulate emotions120. Decreased control over impulsivity and feelings of fear in combination with inflammatory challenges to the brain might increase the risk of suicide.",
            "Abnormal balance between the pro-inflammatory (IL-6 and TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the CNS and in the plasma have been repeatedly observed in patients with BD supporting the notion that neuroimmune response may be a prominent factor contributing to aetiopathogenesis of this illness121,122. In acute phases of BD either during manic or depressive episode, an activation of inflammatory cascades were reported, which was considered by many, but not by all, a characteristic feature of the acute illness, rather than a persistent trait of the disease123. Several cytokines, such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, interferon-γ were found to increase in circulation in acute phases of BD, with a parallel reduction in the anti-inflammatory factors IL-10 and transforming growth factor β-1, especially in the manic phase123,124.",
            "Analysis of the presence of pro-inflammatory molecules in the CSF in BD patients revealed contradictory results. Somewhat high CSF levels of IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1(MCP-1 / CCL-2), and neurofilament light chain were detected in BD subjects, although these biomarkers did not correlate with the outcome of the disease125. A meta-analysis of CSF cytokines content in BD subjects revealed increased levels of IL-1β, the IL-8 showed statistically insignificant rise and no changes for IL-6 were detected126. The disparity between the levels of interleukins and chemokines in blood serum and in the CSF is another controversial issue. It is of course tempting to assume that this discrepancy is lost in COVID-19 since the overload of interleukins and chemokines, compromised BBB and activation of CNS resident and invading immune cells exacerbates the neuroinflammation and promotes a bidirectional flow of inflammatory messengers through a permeable barrier. Such a scenario, however, remains highly hypothetic and much more investigations and analysis are needed to reveal possible association of viral infection in general and COVID-19 in particular with BD.",
            "A wide spectrum of immune system dysregulations as well as infections (together of course with genetic vulnerability, abnormalities in neurotransmission, stress and exposure to environmental factors such as childhood maltreatment) are recognised as potential pathogenetic factors of reactive psychosis127. Enhanced inflammation in psychosis has been confirmed by meta-analyses showing increased concentrations of cytokines and their receptors in chronic schizophrenia, as well as in drug-naïve patients in their first episode of psychosis (FEP)128. A recent study aimed at investigating pro-inflammatory cytokine profile in FEP patients showed an up-regulation of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β, which was not found in healthy siblings, suggesting familiar vulnerability is not involved in generating the inflammatory-related psychotic reactions129.",
            "In an attempt to conceptualise the risk of the emergence of psychosis in subjects infected with SARS-COV-2, it should be emphasised that high levels of IL-6, correlate with reduced hippocampal size in schizophrenic subjects accounting, at least partially, for their cognitive deficits130. Moreover, elevated levels of IL-6 were detected in CSF of schizophrenic subjects104. Even more intriguing is the observation that high levels of IL-6 in adolescents correlate positively with the occurrence of psychosis later in life131.",
            "A growing body of literature reported the occurrence of obsessions and compulsions in patients who had recently recovered from viral encephalitis132. Already in 1930s more than a third of cases of obsessive and compulsive disorders (OCD) were recognised an organic in pathogenesis, and linked with Von Economo’s encephalitis133. Subsequently, neuropsychiatric literature was dotted with numerous case reports ranging from those of obsessive syndromes with post-encephalitic parkinsonism134, to those of post-encephalitic subjects in which diabetes insipidus coexisted with OCD135, to the six OCD patients with anamnesis of viral encephalitis136. Beside these early examples, more recently, high levels of Borna virus immune complexes and viral components (proteins, RNA) were detected in the blood and in peripheral mononuclear cells of OCD patients, reinforcing the notion of a significant link between viral infection and OCD in predisposed subjects137. In this scenario, since functional neuroimaging demonstrated OCD implies alterations in the striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, it was of interest that activity of these circuits may be affected in viral infection, possibly through interferences with glutamate transmission138.",
            "Beyond any doubt immune dysfunction plays a causative role in childhood-onset OCD where the sudden onset of obsessive compulsive signs and tics occurs in the aftermath of a streptococcal infection, with subsequent production of auto-antibodies against neuronal antigens of the basal ganglia139, further supporting the notion that an alteration of the immune system may be implicated in the pathobiology of these disorders. Numerous investigations have shown a correlation between circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and OCD140,141. Increase in blood concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in OCD patients was detected when compared to normal controls paired by gender, age, and educational level142. These findings are in agreement with results of studies investigating drug-naïve, comorbidity-free OCD subjects143. The observation that pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased in a study that eliminated any confounding factors, such as anxious or depressive comorbidity or the effects of psychotropic drugs, represents a more convincing support for the idea that immunological abnormalities contribute to the origin of OCD141. Systemic inflammation which is the prominent feature of COVID-19 may therefore trigger OCD in surviving subjects.",
            "Extensive literature reports epilepsy and behavioural abnormalities as closely linked pathologies144. Indeed, psychiatric diseases are more frequent in epileptic subjects than in general population irrespective of the time of seizures onset, which could occur either before or after the appearance of psychiatric disorders, suggesting a mutual relationship and potentially shared aetiology145. This intriguing coexistence of psychiatric features in epileptic patients does not represent a coincidence or an ordinary comorbidity but more likely it reflects interconnected pathobiological processes146. Neuroinflammation may hint to the underlying mechanism shared by epilepsy and psychiatric disorders, albeit with distinct involvement of neuronal substrates77. This makes any rigid separation between epilepsy and some psychiatric disorders less stringent, and hence we included epilepsy in the discussion for the remarkable behavioural alterations and for the role of neuroinflammation in its pathogenesis.",
            "The link between epilepsy and neuroinflammation is universally recognised77. Persistent neuroinflammatory cascade due to cytokine load and BBB damage is associated with glial reactivity, synaptic changes, and the generation of hyper-excitable networks with lower seizure threshold which all promote epileptic activity147. Epidemiological findings have indicated neuroinfection and systemic infections as one of major cause of acquired epilepsy148,149. Viral encephalitis, for example, increases the risk of subsequent seizures149. Increased concentrations of IL-1 were detected in plasma and CSF of different epileptic phenotypes, suggesting this cytokine seizure-inducing properties150. Changes in GABAergic-transmission and reduction of astrocytic glutamate uptake may account for IL-1 dependent increase in susceptibility to epilepsy151,152. Similarly, raised levels of IL-6 were reported in both plasma and CSF in patients suffering from a wide range of epileptic presentations, while this increased concentrations correlated with the severity of seizures153. Capability of IL-6 to promote epileptogenesis is further corroborated by the evidence that IL-6 overexpression induces abnormal ictogenesis in mice hippocampus154. Associations between epilepsy and COVID-19 have not yet been reported155, however, American Epilepsy Society already suggested that COVID-19 could increase the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). There are some reports which indicate that infections, bacterial or viral may increase the risk of SUDEP. At present, there are no data on the association between COVID −19 and SUDEP156.",
            "Generally, albeit incorrectly, it is assumed that once the trauma is over and the subject is no longer under the pressure of stress, the path for steady recovery begins, since the time heals all wounds. Unfortunately, this is not always the case because in susceptible subjects the active stress instigates brain processes whereby traumatic memories suddenly re-emerge and disturb the mental health. The persistence of these conditions generates the PTSD157. The PTSD is no longer classified among anxiety disorders; it is considered a trauma or stress-related disorder158. The pathogenetic link between inflammation and PTSD is well documented159. Because of marked impact of stressors on the immune system, it is not surprising that PTSD is associated with the immune state160. Increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory factors were observed both within systemic circulation and in the brain in the context of PTSD161. Activation of neuroglia induced by heavy or persistent stressors can stimulate aberrant secretion of pro-inflammatory signals which could potentially facilitate the appearance of PTSD. Data from meta-analyses confirm a remarkable increase in pro-inflammatory molecules in subjects with PTSD, including IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β162–164. The levels of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory interleukin, have been also increased, probably in an attempt to offset the inflammatory processes triggered by stress, further highlighting a close link between inflammation, stress and PTSD165. The occurrence of PTSD was usually associated with occurrence of low-grade inflammation166. Beside changes in cytokines, PTSD is also connected with enhanced NF-κB expression, this transcription factor being implicated in the inflammation process and its elevated expression correlated directly with PTSD severity167. Moreover, PTDS is usually comorbid with depression as well as with anxiety, with drug addiction and with high frequency of suicide, since all these conditions share common inflammatory mechanisms into their pathogenetic processes168. However, it remains to be elucidated whether in all cases the relationship is mutual and what factors, along with the inflammatory ones, play a causative role in determining the comorbidities observed. The PTSD can be a likely outcome for COVID-19 sufferers. This stems not only from severity of systemic inflammation and viral invasion into the brain, but also from the gravity of stress caused by an unexpected pandemic which, for the high mortality, has a shocking value.",
            "Significant number of psychotic episodes in the aftermath of Spanish flu pandemic has highlighted the possibility of increasing incidence of schizophrenic disorders in subjects infected with the SARS-COV-2169. High levels of coronavirus immunoreactivity in subjects with recent onset of psychotic episodes as well as the serious neuropsychiatric complications including auditory and visual hallucinations as well as severe delusions have been reported in COVID-19 patients120,170,171. Although neurodevelopmental origins of schizophrenia are generally accepted, other aetiological factors such as direct effect of a viral neuroinfection or indirect effect of immune aberrations occurring in adult subjects cannot be excluded172. Schizophrenia is also considered as a neurodegenerative illness in adulthood, with neuronal shrinkage and loss, oligodendrocyte damage, alterations in synaptic connectivity, all likely associated with cognitive impairments162–173. Although there are no evidence directly linking COVID-19 with the risk of schizophrenia, frequent occurrence of psychotic episodes highlights the need for further, more detailed investigations.",
            "The SARS-COV-2 pandemic poses a long-lasting challenge, which not only affects cardio-respiratory system but links systemic infection to neuropsychiatric diseases. Investigations of previous viral respiratory epidemics have demonstrated the onset of a wide range of psychiatric disorders over the course and in the aftermath of the infection. The pandemic of Spanish flu in 1918–1920 instigated speculation of the causative role of viral infection in the pathogenetic mechanism of behavioural disorders in bipolar and schizophrenic subjects. Karl Menninger was one of the first to declare that he was persuaded that dementia praecox (as schizophrenia was called in those days) is, in majority of instances, a somatopsychosis, “the psychic manifestations of an encephalitis”174. In the same period, Jacob Kasanin and J.W. Petersen suggested that “a thorough review of some of the early histories of atypical cases of schizophrenia or affective disorders may reveal a previous encephalitis”175.",
            "At present, there are few preliminary studies considering neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19, however, on the basis of the results of the previous epidemics of various respiratory viruses it is possible to assume an increased incidence of mental pathologies as an unwanted sequelae. Not only SARS-COV-2 can penetrate the brain and cause direct damage to neuronal networks, the experience of potentially lethal and untreatable COVID-19 is the cause of a severe distress, which may induce long term behavioural changes or aggravate a pre-existing mental illness. Here we outlined possible neuropsychiatric complications that could arise in subjects infected with SARS-COV-2. Patients with COVID-19 could present with a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms, which result from systemic inflammation, CNS effects of cytokines, infection of neural cells by SARS-COV-2, neuroinflammation, glial dysfunction or aberrant epigenetic modifications of stress-related genes. This review was intended to draw special attention to the psychiatric aspects of COVID-19, because minimizing their relevance by claiming that sometimes “an abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is a normal behaviour”176 could be an unforgivable mistake.",

            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an exceptionally transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus that appeared at the end of 2019 and triggered a pandemic of acute respiratory disease, known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 can evolve into a severe disease associated with immediate and delayed sequelae in different organs, including the central nervous system (CNS). A topic that deserves attention in this context is the complex relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we initially described the clinical and immunopathogenic characteristics of these two illnesses, accentuating the fact that COVID-19 can, in defined patients, reach the CNS, the target tissue of the MS autoimmune process. The well-known contribution of viral agents such as the Epstein-Barr virus and the postulated participation of SARS-CoV-2 as a risk factor for the triggering or worsening of MS are then described. We emphasize the contribution of vitamin D in this scenario, considering its relevance in the susceptibility, severity and control of both pathologies. Finally, we discuss the experimental animal models that could be explored to better understand the complex interplay of these two diseases, including the possible use of vitamin D as an adjunct immunomodulator to treat them.",
            "COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection whose severity varies depending primarily on host conditions and specific mutations found in the several virus variants. Even though the lungs are primarily affected, other organs and tissues such as kidneys, heart, and the nervous system can be injured. Most of its pathophysiological findings have been attributed to a hyperinflammatory syndrome resulting mainly from a dysregulated innate immune response. This review focuses on the interrelationship between COVID-19 and multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune pathology that damages the central nervous system (CNS). Initially, we will discuss the main COVID-19 clinical manifestations, its etiologic agent and immunopathogenesis, and the nervous system involvement which takes place in some patients. MS clinical manifestations, the most relevant stages of its immunopathogenesis and the recognized relevance of viral infections to its development will then be described. The possible role of low vitamin D levels for the development and severity of both diseases and the recommendation of the patient’s supplementation to improve its anti-inflammatory potential will also be addressed. The final section of this review will be dedicated to briefly describe the current animal disease models that could be employed to investigate, simultaneously, both diseases or some aspects related to their immunopathogenesis.",
            "A novel coronavirus named 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2 was originally detected in Wuhan, China, in 2019, but in a few months, it spread out to most countries, initiating a pandemic. This viral agent causes COVID-19 which predominantly affects the respiratory system, causing flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, dyspnea and fatigue [1]. Variable disease severity is observed among patients; around 80% of the affected patients display mild symptoms or can even be asymptomatic, while about 15% may develop more severe symptoms. The remaining 5% of patients can evolve to severe pathological conditions characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multiorgan failures associated with an elevated risk of death [2]. Evolution to more severe conditions has been especially linked to advanced age, existence of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and heart diseases, and genetic and epigenetic factors [3,4,5]. Although this infection is mostly characterized by a significant respiratory impairment, it can also trigger several extrapulmonary manifestations including thrombotic complications, myocardial dysfunction and arrhythmia, acute coronary syndromes, kidney injury, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatocellular lesions, hyperglycemia and ketosis, neurologic alterations, visual disturbances and dermatologic complications [6,7].",
            "The pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been mainly attributed to a direct virus damage, given that ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme), which is the entry receptor for the SARS-CoV-2, is expressed in the lungs and in these other extrapulmonary tissues. Analogously to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 consists of four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N). The spike protein comprises two functional subunits: S1, which binds to the target cell, and S2, which triggers the fusion between the viral and the target cell membrane. SARS-CoV-2 uses two host proteins to enter the target cell; the ACE2 that is used for the attachment to S1 and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) that activates the protease activity of S2. For detailed information about the molecular mechanisms involved in this initial interaction between the virus and the target cell, see [8]. An overview of the viral structure and the initial process of interaction with pneumocytes are illustrated in Figure 1A,B, respectively.",
            "The first line of response against pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, is the innate immunity. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, its recognition by tissue-resident immune cells within the lung provides a local immune response resulting in the recruitment of further cells from the blood. Innate immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) express pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). SARS-CoV-2 is able to initiate the activation of innate immunity by interacting with various PRRs, especially toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG)-like receptors (RLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and inflammasomes. PRR signaling triggered by SARS-CoV-2 induces the concurrent release of IFNs, mainly I and III types, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6 and IL-18 [9]. Together these cytokines will induce antiviral programs in target cells and potentiate the specific immune response, which will eventually control the infection [10]. Contrasting with this well balanced and effective innate immunity, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection to a severe condition has been associated with a reduced or delayed type I IFN response together with high levels of other pro-inflammatory cytokines and high viral titers [11,12]. This defective IFN response has been attributed to inborn errors of type I IFN immunity [13], and to the presence of autoantibodies against this cytokine [14]. Interestingly, a sustained increase in the levels of type I IFN in a later phase of the infection can also promote a poor clinical outcome [15]. Indeed, the signaling mechanisms involved in early (beneficial) or delayed (deleterious) type I IFN production are distinct. A rapid detection of viral RNA by TLR3, 6, and 7 and RLRs triggers a protective response, whereas a later activation of the cGAS-STING by DNA leads to cell death and a damaging production of type I IFN.",
            "Much of COVID-19 severity has been attributed to immune dysregulation manifested by a low production of interferons, remarkable inflammatory response and delayed adaptive immune response. This subject has been intensively investigated and reviewed [16] and will be mentioned here only briefly to reinforce possible connection routes between COVID-19 and MS. The hallmark of most severe cases of COVID-19 is a strong inflammatory process that may ultimately lead to organ failure and patient death (as summarized in Figure 2).",
            "The cytokine storm, also known as cytokine release syndrome is characterized by the extensive activation of macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), NK, B and T cells and the subsequent production of high levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33, IFN-I, IFN-γ, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9 and CXCL10 [17]. Several components are probably involved in the cytokine storm associated with SARS-CoV-2, including the interaction of viral RNA and proteins with PRRs, the binding of the virus to ACE2 and inflammasome activation [18]. It has been demonstrated that in human and mouse epithelial cells the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to TLR2 and induces inflammation via the activation of the NF-κB pathway. The interaction of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 is followed by its reduced expression on the surface because it is internalized together with the virus. As the biological function of ACE2 is to inactivate angiotensin II, there is an increased serum level of this molecule. Increased angiotensin II contributes to COVID-19 severity by inducing specific autoantibodies whose presence correlates with blood pressure dysregulation [19] and increased cytokine production [20]. This strong inflammatory process is largely mediated by the NLRP3 system that promotes inflammation through the cleavage and activation of specialized molecules, including active caspase-1 (Casp1p20), IL-1β, and IL-18. The analysis of samples from moderate and severe COVID-19 cases indicated active NLRP3 inflammasome in PBMCs and tissues of postmortem patients [21]. These authors also observed the correlation of serum inflammasome-derived products, such as Casp1p20 and IL-18 with a poor clinical evolution. According to these authors, inflammation prompted by NLRP3 is initiated by IL-1β which induces the secretion of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 by monocytes. These cytokines determine the influx of PMNs into lung tissue, gasdermin D activation and the subsequent formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which can recruit platelets and promote hypercoagulability. This crucial inflammasome role in COVID-19 pathogenesis has been investigated as a potential target for therapy. To that end, a plethora of inflammasome inhibitors, including natural products as well as already authorized drugs, should be tested in pre-clinical and clinical studies [22]. Even though future studies are still required, clinical findings obtained in a randomized and double-blind placebo-controlled trial in which mefenamic acid was administered to ambulatory patients [23], showed that it significantly reduced their symptomatology in comparison to the placebo group. This efficacy was attributed to both the anti-viral and the anti-inflammatory properties of mefenamic acid.",
            "Concerning the NETs mentioned above, their formation is even more accentuated in most severe COVID-19 cases, what has been attributed to increased immature PMNs and the presence of anti-NET antibodies. In addition, these antibodies can impair NET clearance and possibly enhance virus-mediated thrombo-inflammation [24]. IL-1β and IL-6 can also directly contribute to coagulation in the lung vasculature by decreasing adherens junctions in endothelial cells. Tissue factor positive extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by pyroptotic monocytes can also directly activate the clotting cascade and promote coagulation in COVID-19.",
            "In addition to the direct virus damage and the deleterious immune response, pieces of evidences reinforce the view that the gut–lung axis will affect both the susceptibility and efficacy of the immune response against the virus. It is well known that the virus affects mainly the respiratory system; however, the gastrointestinal system is also a critical target. Gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are present in a high percentage of COVID-19 patients. These symptoms have been attributed to the infection of gut epithelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 and the local dysbiosis characterized by alterations in microbiota bacterial composition and diversity [25]. The respiratory tract has its own microbiota and it was already demonstrated that infections by other respiratory viruses induce local inflammation which contributes to gut dysbiosis [26]. A similar effect could be expected from a lung SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "Many patients have reported the persistence of symptoms as fatigue, exercise intolerance, dyspnea, muscle pain, insomnia, chest pain, anosmia, cough, and brain fog after the acute disease stage [27]. This condition has been denominated Post-COVID-19 syndrome or Long-COVID-19. Interestingly, in addition to the degree of infection severity, antibiotic usage has been considered one of the main risk factors for Long-COVID-19 development [28]. Antibiotic prescription, which is expected to be more common in severe COVID-19 patients, would alter the gut microbiota composition. This hypothesis is strongly sustained by evidence showing that antibiotics are major disruptors of gut microbiota [29]. In addition, gut dysbiosis triggered by excessive antibiotic administration, together with poorly controlled glycaemia and not well-regulated steroid administration were also identified as risk factors for COVID-19-associated mucormycosis [30], a rare and lethal fungal infection. Despite the complex gut dysbiosis scenario induced by the virus itself, as demonstrated in both a hamster experimental model and human patients [31,32], which is aggravated by antibiotic use, there is already a variety of promising microbiota-oriented strategies being suggested as prophylactic or therapeutic interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, microbiota-derived metabolites and even fecal transplantation [33]. Notably, whether lung dysbiosis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or antibiotic usage impacts the poor outcomes of COVID-19 is still an open question. Besides the microbiota-mediated gut–lung communication axis, another important systemic axis of immune communication impacts COVID-19 and MS: the gut–brain axis, as addressed afterward in this review.",
            "The neuropathology associated with COVID-19 is a complex condition related to the local presence of the virus, the induced local and peripheral immune responses and to alterations in the microbiota, the vascular and the coagulation systems. The following neurological manifestations have been reported in COVID-19 patients: headache, myalgia, dizziness and fatigue, described as mild; hyposmia, hypogeusia, visual disturbances, encephalopathy, epilepsy, paralysis and consciousness disorder, identified in moderate to severe cases; and cerebrovascular events, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, meningitis, encephalitis and Guillain-Barré syndrome, considered as severe conditions [34]. The prevalence of these manifestations seems to be particularly increased in hospitalized patients [35]. The pathogenesis of CNS infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the neurological complications are still poorly understood. Most of these symptoms have been attributed to the ingress of the virus into the nervous system. Neuro-invasion by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed by the virus detection in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient suffering from Guillain-Barré syndrome [36], in infected brain organoids, in mice expressing human ACE2 and autopsies from deceased patients [37]. Two major routes have been associated with this neuro-invasion: through peripheral neurons and by hematogenous dissemination [38]. The peripheral nerve endings are believed to be the most common route used by SARS-CoV-2 to reach the CNS. The olfactory nerve is considered the major candidate because it is located very close to the olfactory epithelium which, by expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2, allows initial virus replication [39]. Indeed, in a non-human primate model, it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the CNS primarily via the olfactory bulb [40]. This process has been described as transcribrial route because it occurs across the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, followed by retrograde viral spread via transsynaptic transfer using an endocytosis or exocytosis mechanism and a rapid axonal transport. The virus could also gain access to the CNS via the vagal afferents from the upper airways [41] and the enteric nervous system [42]. Another possible route is through the virus’s presence in the bloodstream from where it can reach the nervous system by a direct interaction with brain capillary cells or by means of an infected leukocyte. The detection of viral particles in capillary endothelial cells in the front lobe tissue obtained in a post mortem sample gives support to this interaction with endothelial cells [43]. Infected leukocytes could also pass through the blood–brain barrier (BBB), acting as a Trojan horse. More recently, this hypothesis that infected cells could cross the BBB as a Trojan horse has been extended to include exosomes and high-density lipoproteins associated with SARS-CoV-2 [44].",
            "The most recurrent neuropathological findings in COVID-19 patients include microglial activation, lymphoid inflammation with a clear predominance of TCD8+ cells, astrogliosis, myelin loss, hypoxia-ischemic changes, brain infarcts and hemorrhage and mi-crothrombi [45]. Part of these findings is due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection of microglia and neurons which express different receptors for spike as ACE2, ephrin (Eph) ligands and the Eph receptors, neuropilin 1 (NRP-1), P2X7 and CD147 [46]. Similar to peripheral infection, CNS infection also triggers a cytokine and chemokine avalanche causing neurotoxicity, disruption of the neuroglia homeostasis and neuronal death [47].",
            "As previously addressed in item 2 of this review, the dissemination of the virus to the gastrointestinal system is an aggravating condition that can also affect the nervous system due to an altered microbiota gut–brain axis. It is of note that the gut-microbiota signatures shared by COVID-19 patients and neurological and psychiatric disorders have been described [48]. Such signatures are characterized by a reduction in microbial diversity and richness, an expansion of opportunistic proinflammatory pathogens and a reduction in anti-inflammatory-promoting bacteria. One of the consequences of this disrupted axis is a decreased secretion of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), whose anti-inflammatory ability is well recognized. Therefore, the potential benefit of direct SCFA supplementation or reliance on probiotics prescription is being suggested for COVID-19 patients [49]. The disturbed synthesis of other gut–brain axis mediators, such as cytokines, 5-hydroxytryptamine and cholecystokinin, can additionally contribute to neurological manifestations during COVID-19 [50]. Notably, the gut–brain axis is also dysfunctional in MS [51], disclosing another link in this already puzzling interplay.",
            "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is classically described as an inflammatory and demyelinating disease originating from an autoimmune disturbance. It is characterized by multifocal and scattered lesions through the grey and white matter from the brain and spinal cord. A damaged myelin sheath commonly results in vision and coordination loss, muscle weakness, stiffness and spasms, pain, and changes in bladder and bowel function. An MS diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation, supported by neuroimaging, and in some cases, by cerebrospinal fluid analysis to search for inflammatory markers and oligoclonal antibody bands [52]. Even though MS is considered a single disease, it can manifest under different phenotypes. According to [53], this characteristic is due to its multifactorial etiology that includes a genetic predisposition together with environmental elements such as infectious agents, mainly viruses, and vitamin D (vitD) levels, as will be commented on later. Understanding how these factors affect this disease is fundamental because this is a handicapping pathology whose incidence and prevalence are increasing worldwide. Four basic disease courses, which can also be referred to as phenotypes or types, are recognized: clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). RRMS is considered the most common phenotype, affecting around 85% of patients. As indicated by its designation, it is characterized by alternating relapses and remissions, which are periods of neurological dysfunction or absence of neurological symptoms, respectively [54]. A noteworthy finding is the strong association of relapses with infections, postpartum period, genetic risk factors, stress, and vitD levels [55]. In addition, an increased relative risk for relapses has been associated with infections located in the upper respiratory system or affecting the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts [56].",
            "MS immunopathogenesis has been disclosed by using both patient samples and information from animal models, especially experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). This disease is induced in mice and rats by immunization with myelin-derived proteins and peptides in the presence of complete Freund’s adjuvant and pertussis toxin [57]. The sequence of events leading to the onset of MS is outlined in Figure 3 and is briefly described below.",
            "It is accepted that the activation of myelin-specific T cells would occur in peripheral lymphoid organs by different mechanisms such as the recognition of microbial epitopes sharing homology with self-antigens (molecular mimicry), the release of myelin from the CNS by a local insult, or by bystander activation [58]. The perspective that molecules derived from a dysbiotic gut microbiota could induce neuroinflammation and symptoms of MS by mimicking autoantigens has been interestingly proposed [59]. Other mechanisms, including the induction of co-stimulation, polyclonal activation, altered processing and expression of cryptic antigens could also be induced by infectious agents and contribute to the onset of autoimmunity [60].",
            "A fairly new concept has emerged from EAE studies in the last few years and is called “licensing” or more clearly “licensing for pathogenicity”. This stage, which seems to occur in the lungs, spleen or maybe both, allows the T cells to become pathogenic, reach the CNS and orchestrate a local inflammatory process [61,62]. This licensing process is accomplished by a change in the gene expression pattern marked by the downregulation of proliferation/activation-related genes and upregulation of migration-promoting genes [63]. Th17 cells play a critical encephalitogenic role by opening the BBB [64] and promoting neurodegeneration [65].",
            "The immune system associated with the intestinal mucosa has recently been recognized as pivotal to MS and EAE development. This crucial role in the pathogenesis occurs mainly by promoting the activation and acquisition of the Th17 phenotype [66,67]. It is assumed that the activation of effector Th17 cells occurs mostly in the murine small intestine, regardless of their ensuing function [66,68]. Interestingly, the development of steady-state or pathogenic Th17 cells is critically determined by microbiota composition. Segmented filamentous bacteria, for example, induce brain autoimmunity in mice by selectively privileging Th17 differentiation [69].",
            "Two barriers protect the CNS integrity and functionality: the BBB and the blood–cerebrospinal fluid (B–CSF) barrier. They are located in distinct CNS compartments and their dysfunction can allow leukocyte access and the ensuing neurodegeneration in MS and EAE [70]. The integrity of these barriers can be disturbed by peripheral inflammation, infections and proinflammatory cytokines. There are a number of mechanisms by which an exaggerated inflammatory process can induce the disruption of these barriers, including changes in tight junctions, damage to endothelial cells, the activation of astrocytes and microglia, and the effects of peripheral immune cells [71]. The invasion of the CNS by neurotropic viruses, by hematogenous or non-hematogenous routes, can be associated with structural and functional BBB alterations that also lead to its breakdown [72]. Specific cytokines have been more often linked with alterations in these barriers as shown by [73], which found that periodontal inflammation-induced IL-6 is associated with neuroinflammation and BBB disruption in the hippocampus.",
            "A variety of infiltrating cells, mainly γδT, Th1 and Th17 cells, are locally expanded and release cytokines that will activate microglia and oligodendrocytes. Together with the ones mobilized from the periphery, these activated cells will release inflammatory mediators such as IL-8, IL-17, GM-CSF, CCL2 and enzymes that will trigger neurodegeneration [74,75]. A great deal of contribution to this damaging process has been imputed to B cells, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammasome activation [76,77]. This process will eventually be controlled by regulatory mechanisms involving different cell subsets such as Tregs CD25+Foxp3+, Tr1, Qa-1 restricted CD8, regulatory B cells, NK and CNS-derived myeloid-derived suppressor cells [78]. However, defined viruses, namely EBV and HHV6, could trigger relapses through a peripheral mechanism rather than a direct effect through intrathecal multiplication [79].",
            "The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes lifelong infection, usually subclinical, in more than 90% of the adult population worldwide. However, it is also the causal agent of infectious mononucleosis, some types of cancer and severe lymphoproliferative diseases. Epidemiological, serological and virological pieces of evidences support its role also in MS development [80]. Primary EBV infection occurs in the squamous epithelial cells where it replicates and from where it reaches and infects the B lymphocytes from Waldeyer´s tonsillar ring. Consequently, naive B cells undergo a germinal center-like activation and differentiation program affecting more than 11,000 genes. This process culminates in proliferating immortalized B cells resembling plasmablasts and early plasma cells [81]. Therefore, in the context of MS, EBV is understood as a disease trigger. This possibility was tested in a large cohort of more than 10 million US army personnel [80]. A 32-fold increase in MS diagnosis in individuals who became seropositive, compared with those that remained seronegative, was observed. This role of EBV has been mainly attributed to cross-reactivity between self and EBV antigens, involving both cellular and humoral immunity [82]. Additionally, as B cells and plasma cells have been identified in the brain of deceased MS patients, but not in controls [83], it is believed that induction of B cell trafficking to the CNS is also involved in this mechanism [84]. The recognized efficacy of monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, which targets the B cell surface marker CD20, adds more credibility to the contribution of EBV to MS development [85]. Considering that certain deregulated immunological pathways found during severe COVID-19 coincide with immune alterations present in MS, it has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 could be a risk factor for the triggering or worsening of MS in prone individuals.",
            "Through a system biology study, [86] found the expressive interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with genes associated with autoimmunity, especially MS. In this scenario, these authors highlighted three intersecting pathways: type-1 IFN response, Th17 axis, and inflammasome pathway, which were considered critical in this COVID-19 vs MS interplay and that will be briefly commented on. The hypothesis that MS is a type of IFN I deficiency syndrome was initially proposed in [87] and later expanded to encompass other autoimmune diseases as well [87]. Type I IFN appears to play a pivotal role in the CNS, avoiding both severe infections, especially viral ones through its antiviral effect, and local inflammation through its immunomodulatory potential [88]. In 1993, type I IFN, mainly the β-1a type, was adopted as the first disease-modifying therapy for MS [89]. Coincidentally, dysregulated and/or delayed type I IFN responses are also associated with severe COVID-19 prognosis. Dysfunctional IFN I production can be caused by inborn errors, by the presence of anti-IFN I autoantibodies and by inhibition of type I IFN production by several SARS-CoV-2 proteins [90,91]. In this context, one can speculate that MS patients with IFN I deficiencies would be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. To the best of our knowledge, this possibility has not been investigated yet. On the other hand, MS patients under type I IFN therapy would be more protected against severe forms of COVID-19. This possibility was reinforced in [92], which showed a lower, even though not significant risk of infection by this virus in these MS patients. Moreover, only minor COVID-19 symptoms were described in an MS patient under IFN I therapy [93]. Given this scenario, we could presume that COVID-19 is potentially able, considering its ability to reach the CNS and to infect an IFN I deficient MS patient, to trigger an MS relapse or worsen disease symptoms.",
            "The Th1/Th17 axis, which is responsible for IFN-y and IL-17 production, is also shared by both pathologies. The contribution of these Th subsets to MS immunopathogenesis is strongly supported by the literature [94]. Interestingly, the Th17 subset develops in the intestine and its higher frequency correlates with microbiota alterations [67]. Coincidentally, severe COVID-19 is associated with high levels of IFN-y, Th17 polarization [10] and gut microbiota dysbiosis [32]. This scenario suggests that a Th1/Th17 active axis in COVID-19 or MS patients could aggravate MS or COVID-19 symptoms, respectively.",
            "Another critical link at the crossroad between COVID-19 and MS is the inflammasome, a complex molecular platform comprising a sensor protein, inflammatory caspases and, in some cases, an adapter protein that bridges the two other components. Its activation by DAMPs and PAMPs promotes IL-1β and IL-18 production and pyroptosis [95]. Dysregulated inflammasome activation can be associated with infections and inflammatory pathologies. A strong contribution has been attributed to inflammasomes, especially the NLRP3, to the development of MS and its experimental animal model (EAE). NLRP3 activation is involved in various MS stages such as initial inflammation, T cell polarization, CNS barrier breakdown and neurodegeneration [96]. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to activate this platform has also been clearly demonstrated during COVID-19 and is accentuated in the more aggressive disease [97]. This association makes sense, considering that a significant cause of COVID-19 pathogenesis and subsequent severity is the cytokine storm associated with NLRP3 overactivation [98].",
            "Despite the expectation of a deleterious effect of COVID-19 on MS manifestations, a retrospective study concluded that, regardless of its severity, COVID-19 was not associated with an increased risk of MS relapse shortly after infection [99]. The authors attributed these non-expected results to post-COVID-19 lymphopenia and to the use of immunomodulatory drugs to control MS. However, the authors also do not rule out the possibility that COVID-19’s deleterious effects will be observed later as sequels associated with post-COVID condition. The stages of MS immunopathogenesis that could most likely be deleteriously affected by SARS are schematically suggested in Figure 4.",
            "Numerous questions have been raised concerning the relationship between MS and vitD levels. Some of the most relevant ones, considering practical purposes, are: Is there a vitD deficiency in MS patients and is this a risk factor to develop this disease and to present a more severe pathology? Is vitD supplementation indicated for MS patients? How would vitD control MS pathogenesis?",
            "The literature data concerning the relationship between vitD and MS support the concepts that there is a vitD deficiency in these patients, that this is a risk factor for disease development and that this deficit probably contributes to a more severe pathology. The hypothesis that adequate vitD levels were relevant to preventing MS development emerged from the realization that this disease was more prevalent in geographical regions with a lower solar incidence where the production of this vitamin by the skin, stimulated by UV light, is low. The high prevalence of vitD deficiency in MS patients was formally described in 1994 [100]. This finding was subsequently validated by other authors who also showed a significant correlation between this deficiency, MRI load and disease severity [101]. Several studies have been conducted to determine if vitD supplementation could be considered as an add-on therapy for MS. A study performed in relapsing-remitting patients investigated its supplementation in patients under IFN-β-1b [102]. Even though no difference has been observed in the annual relapse rate, the vitD supplemented group presented a reduced disease activity indicated by MRI. According to [103], the supplementation with vitD of MS patients under natalizumab treatment corrected hypovitaminosis and decreased annualized relapse rate. As vitD efficacy could rely on high doses and considering that this could trigger fatigue, muscle weakness, renal failure and cardiac arrhythmia, some clinical trials were designed to test possible deleterious outcomes. It was found, however, that even vitD supplements that elevated twice the top of physiological range did not elicit hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria or any other detrimental effect [104]. Nonetheless, a clinical trial concerning the efficacy of a high vitD dose was inconclusive, neither supporting nor discrediting its potential benefit [105]. So far, there is no substantial evidence to approve this vitamin as an add-on therapy for MS [106]. Despite the literature discrepancies, these authors recommend implementing standardized study designs with well-defined variables concerning the kind of vitD supplement, its concentration, cohort composition, and the clinical and laboratory parameters to be evaluated. They also recommend the collection and storage of samples to assemble a bio-bank for further evaluations. Detailed reasoning and suggestions regarding their proposed study design are available in their publication.",
            "Our research team has been testing vitD efficacy in EAE. Our findings indicate a clear window of opportunity for therapy with vitD in an animal model which could also be relevant for the human disease. We found that vitD is still effective when administered during the preclinical disease phase. However, it is important to clarify that earlier supplementation determines a more pronounced therapeutic effect [107,108].",
            "It is well established that vitD signaling pathways are able to regulate both innate and adaptive immunity, keeping the associated inflammatory response within physiological limits. The immunomodulatory ability of vitD is clearly pleiotropic and reaches the majority of the immune cells in different phases of the immune response. This is explained by its interaction with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) expressed in immune cells including PMNs, macrophages, DCs, and B and T lymphocytes [109]. Understanding this essential VitD biological activity has sparked much interest in two aspects: vitD level in patients with inflammatory diseases and the possibility of its supplementation as a therapeutic measure. The interaction of the active form of vitD with VDR and the main effects over the immune system are illustrated in Figure 5. An overview of the main outcomes from vitD interaction with immune cells is presented in Table 1. Its potential as an adjunct or alternative therapy in inflammatory diseases is exemplified in Table 1.",
            "The presumed protective effect of vitD on MS may occur in both the periphery and the CNS. As previously mentioned in this review, it has been suggested that the immune response against neural antigens is initiated in the peripheral lymphoid organs. VitD could already be effective at this initial stage by modulating the differentiation and function of APCs. It has been widely demonstrated that vitD affects the differentiation, maturation and function of DCs, directing them to a tolerogenic profile [107,142]. These APCs will then modulate naïve TCD4+ lymphocytes toward a functional hypo-reactive state. VitD-induced tolerogenic DCs are also capable of driving the differentiation of Tregs. This effect was demonstrated in EAE by the adoptive transference of vitD-induced IDO+ DCs, which are immature and tolerogenic cells. This procedure increased the percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs in the lymph nodes of rats with EAE [143]. The ability of VitD to decrease proliferation and differentiation of effector proinflammatory T cells in EAE was also demonstrated [144]. This effect was associated with the downmodulation of various metabolic and signaling routes which are essential for Th1/Th17 polarization. This inhibition was concurrent with reduced DNA methylation and the upregulation of many non-coding RNA classes.",
            "One of the critical stages of MS immunopathogenesis is the BBB breakdown which can be detected in patients via gadolinium-enhanced MRI in the CNS [145]. An effect at this level is expected, considering that BBB endothelial cells express VDR. Our research team showed that calcitriol administration to a murine model of MS decreases neuroinflammation and reduces BBB disruption [146]. Other experimental pieces of evidence have disclosed the molecular mechanisms underlying this protective effect. By using an in vitro system comprising a human brain microvascular endothelial cell line stimulated with TNF-α or sera from MS patients, the authors in [147] showed that vitD determined the upregulation of tight junction proteins and downregulation of cell adhesion molecules. VitD can also downmodulate neuroinflammation by targeting additional CNS cells. It decreases, for example, the production of TNF-α, IL-1β and the expression of IL-4 by astrocytes stimulated with LPS in vitro. This likely outcome was reproduced in neonatal rats injected with LPS [148]. The addition of vitD to stimulated microglial cells reduces the expression of Iba-1, MHC-II, CD86 and TLR-4 in vitro, and in EAE [146,149]. By using a model of demyelination in rats, the authors in [150] described that VitD also operates at the level of remyelination. VitD promotes the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells and their migration to the lesion site, where they subsequently differentiate into oligodendrocyte lineage cells and produce myelin basic protein. Lastly, the possibility that vitD is also acting through inflammasome inhibition must be considered. This system operates in the periphery during the initial induction/expansion of Th1/Th17 cells and also during the inflammatory process in the CNS. The demonstration in [151] that vitD negatively regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome via VDR signaling, effectively inhibiting IL-1β secretion, gives some support to this additional level of vitD protection in MS.",
            "Analogous to the approach used to analyze the relationship between MS and vitD, we also limited the complex connection between COVID-19 and vitD to answer the same three questions: Is there vitD deficiency in COVID-19 patients and is this a risk factor for getting infected and to develop a more severe pathology? Is vitD supplementation indicated for COVID-19 patients? How would vitD control COVID-19 pathogenesis?",
            "An analysis between vitD levels and the number of COVID-19 cases in 20 European countries showed a significant negative correlation, suggesting that higher levels of this hormone could afford some protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection [152]. These findings were reinforced by the observation that many hospitalized COVID-19 patients presented vitD serum levels considered below the normal expected ones [153,154]. The majority of the findings also support an inverse correlation between vitD deficiency and a poor prognosis for COVID-19. According to [155], low vitD levels at hospital admission were associated with increased IL-6 production and predicted the severity of respiratory distress and mortality during the course of hospitalization. This association between vitD deficiency and severe COVID-19 has been confirmed by several other researchers [156,157,158,159]. From a theoretical point of view, based mainly on vitD’s immunomodulatory properties, its adoption as an adjunct therapy for COVID-19 seems consistent. For instance, the authors in [160] have investigated the effect of oral vitD supplementation in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients with low levels of this vitamin. They observed that 5000 IU of vitD reduced the recovery time related to cough and loss of taste and smell. The adequate levels of vitD in the host have been associated with the reduced release of proinflammatory cytokines, thus lowering the risk of a cytokine storm; increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines; and enhanced secretion of natural antimicrobial peptides. It may also be involved in the enhancement of the Th2 immune response and activation of defensive cells such as macrophages, as illustrated in Figure 5. Contrary to these findings, several studies have concluded that there is no direct association between vitD concentrations and a poor prognosis of the disease [161]. By employing a meta-analysis and GRADE assessment of cohort studies and RCTs, the authors of [162] inferred that low vitD levels do not play a role in disease severity and that supplementation does not improve outcomes in hospitalized patients.",
            "The explanation for these conflicting results could be partially related to intra- and inter-cohort variability. Other parameters including supplementation protocols such as doses, period of supplementation, patient’s age, presence of comorbidities and even the risk of bias, could contribute to this variability. This ambiguous scenario has prevented an official recommendation concerning the prophylactic or therapeutic use of vitD for COVID-19 control [163]. The presumptive ability of vitD to control SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and COVID-19 severity would be mediated by different mechanisms. Some of them are related to the capacity of this hormone to increase the production of antimicrobial peptides, in particular cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, also known as LL-37 [164]. LL-37 is produced by immune cells and epithelial cells from the skin and respiratory tract. Experimental data strongly suggests that this peptide can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and other alterations that contribute to disease severity. Human cathelicidin can inhibit virus infection by directly interacting with the SARS-CoV-2 RDB and also by masking the ACE2 [165]. According to [166], a plethora of other biological activities have been ascribed to LL-37 and could contribute to its eventual preventive and therapeutic adoption against COVID-19. In this sense, this peptide is endowed with an immunomodulatory ability, could facilitate efficient NET clearance by macrophages and speed endothelial repair. These authors also addressed the fact that further investigations about the VitD/LL-37 axis in the context of COVID-19 are highly recommended considering that vitD could be a widely accessible strategy.",
            "One of the hallmarks of severely affected COVID-19 patients is the presence of a cytokine storm, mainly triggered by the activation of cells from innate immunity. The well-established ability of vitD to directly control cytokine and chemokine production could provide another mechanism for vitD usefulness as an adjunct therapy for COVID-19. This effect derives mostly from the downmodulatory ability of vitD over Th1 and Th17 differentiation and cytokine production [167,168]. This mechanism is already suggested by clinical findings in COVID-19 patients. The authors in [169] described that vitD supplementation in geriatric intensive care patients suffering from COVID-19 reduced many inflammatory parameters, including IL-16, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-Dimer, ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase. Its activity against endothelial dysfunction [170], and vascular thrombosis [170] could also contribute to the ability to control COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.",
            "Many questions concerning the relationship between COVID-19 and MS have already been raised and partially answered by experts in the field. We believe, however, that experimental animal models could add more knowledge to the remaining gaps of the complex interplay between these two pathologies. Insightful and updated reviews have been published regarding the most useful animal models to investigate, separately, these two pathologies [57,171,172,173].",
            "For the sake of objectivity, only the models that seem to be immediately or more easily available to investigate aspects concomitantly related to these two pathologies will be briefly described, as summarized in Figure 6. Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) are widely used in the research of respiratory viruses. In addition, their ACE2 receptor binds tightly to SARS-CoV-2 which makes then naturally susceptible to infection by this virus. The experimental trans-nasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in 4–8-week-old hamsters triggers a reproducible infection characterized by a short-term, self-limiting, epitheliotropic infection of the lungs and intestine with almost complete elimination of the virus before 14 days post infection. Details of these lesions, which are similar to the ones found in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2, were described in [174]. This experimental disease can progress with different degrees of severity, depending upon the hamster strain [175]. It was recently described in [176] that hamsters develop a condition that clearly resembles the post-acute sequels of COVID-19. After virus clearance, these animals presented a clear inflammatory process in both the olfactory bulb and the olfactory epithelium. This process included the activation of myeloid and T cells, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-y. We believe that this is an interesting model to be explored in the context of these two diseases. The use of hamsters to model MS are scarce. However, older publications by the authors of [177] showed that Syrian hamsters immunized with guinea pig spinal cord derived antigen, in the presence of adjuvants, developed a chronic paralysis after 50–100 days, which was often relapsing. Seventy percent of these animals presented mononuclear cell infiltration and focal demyelination in the neuraxis [178] also demonstrated that the susceptibility of these rodents to develop EAE was highly dependent on the specific inbred strain, with some being able to develop acute paralysis around 10–21 days after immunization. Interesting, this model was already used to test the possible interference of a virus on EAE development [179] showed that the persistence of the measles virus in the CNS exacerbated EAE manifestations.",
            "For many reasons, including the availability of reagents to perform immunological characterizations, mice constitute the first choice for these investigations. However, wild-type murine ACE2 does not bind adequately to the viral spike protein, rendering them resistant to the infection [180]. Different strategies have been engendered to overcome this obstacle. We believe that transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 would be worthwhile to be tested, considering that COVID-19 severity could be controlled by the level of ACE2 expression [173] which would allow a more precise investigation about the potential role of this infection on EAE aggravation. These transgenic mice need to have a C57BL/6 and SJL background to be able to develop the classic EAE pathology. To the best of our knowledge, the suitability of ACE2 transgenic C57BL/6 and SJL mice strains to develop EAE was not tested yet. This investigation is mandatory considering that transgenesis could alter the evolution of EAE in these animals. The most employed animal model for MS studies is experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Murine EAE is usually induced by active immunization with myelin-derived peptides emulsified with complete Freund’s adjuvant in the presence of pertussis toxin. C57BL/6 and SJL/J mice strains immunized with specific immunodominant peptides develop a chronic and a relapsing-remitting form of the disease, respectively [181]. EAE in mice is characterized by an ascending paralysis that starts by the tail, followed by limb and forelimb paralysis, and its clinical severity can be easily classified by a clinical score based on a five-point scale [182], together with weight loss. The immunization of SJL/J mice with PLP139-151 can result in an initial paralytic attack, followed by multiple remissions and relapses, whereas immunization of C57BL6/J mice with MOG35-55 usually causes a chronic disease course in which an initial attack does not resolve.",
            "Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a nematode species which has been increasingly employed as a model to investigate human diseases. This has been possible because humans and C. elegans share some identity concerning the digestive, the nervous and the reproductive systems. Indeed, many important signaling pathways are highly conserved between this worm and humans. Even though this worm lacks the classic adaptive immunity system, which is typical of vertebrates, it is endowed with a variety of innate mechanisms that have been studied to understand microbe-host interactions, originally during bacterial infections [183]. Later on, it was discovered that C. elegans could be also employed to investigate anti-viral defense mechanisms [184]. This was demonstrated by using both natural viruses such as Orsay, Santeuil and Le Blanc [185,186] and non-natural ones such as Flock House and stomatitis virus [184]. Similar to the murine models, this nematode could be adapted to SARS-CoV-2 research by expressing the human ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 co-factor. In the context of this review, this transgenic nematode model could be especially useful to investigate alterations in innate immunity and the nervous system associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. As far as we know, C. elegans has not being directly used to study aspects related to MS; however, it is a well-established model to investigate neurodegenerative diseases in a general way, offering many advantages over other model systems to decipher the involved mechanisms. Of particular importance for the study of neurodegenerative processes are the nematode’s small genome, the anatomical simplicity and the availability of a complete 3D map of the 302-cell nervous system [184,187]. It has been suggested that the control of more severe COVID-19 cases will require a poly-therapeutic approach including both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory medicines. According to [188], C. elegans was recently included as an additional system to establish a combination therapy platform to treat COVID-19. Interestingly, C. elegans express DAF-12 that is a nuclear hormone receptor which is homologous to the VDR expressed in human cells. The authors in [189] demonstrated that the uptake of vitD by C. elegans via their traditional E. coli food source results in a significantly extended lifespan. The capacity of this worm to respond to vitD could be additionally useful in studies involving neurodegeneration considering that this hormone has a well-defined neuroprotective role [190]. The characteristics of this nematode model system which includes relative simplicity, ease of use, exquisite genetics, and an available genomic sequence, provides an extremely useful model system in many areas of study. Indeed, many important signaling pathways are highly conserved between C. elegans and humans; this worm has more than 7500 genes with human homologs [191].",
            "Having in mind that most of COVID-19’s pathogenesis is due to a hyperinflammatory reaction and that this process can affect MS, a few models of inflammation induction by virus antigens are also succinctly described. Ref. [18] observed that the spike protein is able to induce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, CXCL1, CXCL2 and CCL2, but not IFNs, in human cells, in mouse macrophages or lung epithelial cells. The potential of the spike protein to induce inflammation in vivo was shown by [192]. However, the most relevant data from their work was the characterization of a lung inflammation model induced by coadministration of aerosolized S protein and LPS to the lungs. This procedure triggered a strong pulmonary inflammation and a cytokine profile similar to that observed in more severe COVID-19. According to the authors, this model mimics better the more stringent lung involvement in patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These patients frequently present abnormal gut permeability allowing the translocation of LPS through the gut epithelia and, therefore, its availability to interact with the virus spike. The ability of the spike to strongly bind to LPS and boost the proinflammatory activity was previously demonstrated in [193]. The whole inactivated virus has also been employed to elicit inflammation. The intratracheal instillation of human ACE2-transgenic mice with formaldehyde-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 caused weight loss and pulmonary pathologic alterations such as consolidation, hemorrhage, necrotic debris and hyaline membrane formation. IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and the infiltration of activated neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes, macrophages and T cells were also detected in the lungs [194]. We recently established a model of lung inflammation via the intranasal instillation of UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2. This procedure triggered an exuberant inflammatory process composed of various cell types and mediators similar to lung inflammation associated with COVID-19 [195]. This inflammatory process was significantly downmodulated by intranasal vitD administration, suggesting that this hormone has the potential to be an adjunct therapy for COVID-19. In addition, considering our previous data that support a strong protective effect of vitD on EAE development [107,108,146], we believe that IN vitD administration could downmodulate inflammatory reactions occurring simultaneously in the lungs and the CNS.",
            "COVID-19 and MS are associated with several immunological disturbances that could, theoretically, interfere with each other’s disease onset or outcome. SARS-CoV-2 displays, for example, molecular mimicry with CNS epitopes and causes microbiota and BBB disruption which are crucial for MS development. This virus can also reach and inflame the CNS itself which is the target of the autoimmune inflammatory reaction that characterizes MS. These two pathologies also share a possible type I IFN deficient production and hyperactivation of both the Th1/Th17 axis and the NLRP3 inflammasome platform which could mutually cause disease aggravation. The role of vitD levels in susceptibility, severity and possible adjunctive therapy in both diseases have been investigated and highly discussed but not well-established yet. This complex interplay between COVID-19 and MS urgently needs further and in-depth investigations. A plethora of experimental animal models, usually employed to study each of these pathologies individually, as is the case of C. elegans, hamster strains and transgenic mice, could be explored to investigate aspects related to both diseases simultaneously. These disease models could not only complement the current knowledge but also possible future questions, bearing in mind that more severe neurological changes associated with long-term COVID are possible.",

            "Endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, by affecting vascular homeostasis and worsening thromboinflammation. This imbalance may contribute to blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, which has been reported in long COVID-19 patients with neurological sequelae. The kallikrein–kinin system (KKS) generates bradykinin (BK), a proinflammatory peptide that induces microvascular leakage via B2R. Under inflammatory conditions, BK is converted to Des-Arg-BK (DABK), which activates B1R, a receptor upregulated in inflamed tissues. DABK is degraded by ACE2, the main SARS-CoV-2 receptor; thus, viral binding and ACE2 downregulation may lead to DABK/B1R imbalance. Here, we investigated these interactions using human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs), as a model of the BBB. Since endothelial cell lines express low levels of ACE2, HBMECs were modified with an ACE2-carrying pseudovirus. SARS-CoV-2 replication was confirmed by RNA, protein expression, and infectious particles release. Infection upregulated cytokines and endothelial permeability, enhancing viral and leukocyte transmigration. Additionally, viral replication impaired ACE2 function in HBMECs, amplifying the response to DABK, increasing nitric oxide (NO) production, and further disrupting endothelial integrity. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 impacts the BBB and highlights the ACE2/KKS/B1R axis as a potential contributor to long COVID-19 neurological symptoms.",
            "COVID-19 clinical syndromes result from a complex interplay between direct viral cytopathic effects, dysregulated immune responses, and activation of coagulation pathways [1,2]. In severe cases, lung pathology is marked by interstitial edema, fibrin deposition, and inflammatory infiltrates, likely driven by increased vascular permeability [3,4]. Elevated circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF are frequently detected [5], contributing to systemic inflammation. Systemic complications, such as thromboinflammation, have been attributed to dysregulated activation of coagulation pathways, including the extrinsic pathway, driven by elevated expression of tissue factor (TF) by circulating leukocytes and released cellular vesicles [6]. Regarding the contact pathway, other studies have reported increased activation or consumption of factor XII (FXIIa), plasma kallikrein (PKa), and high molecular weight kininogen (HK), all of which are members of the proinflammatory kallikrein–kinin system (KKS) [7,8,9]. Commonly used as biomarkers of thromboinflammation, plasma D-dimers levels helped to identify patients that were at risk of severe COVID-19 [10]. Endothelial activation markers, including von Willebrand factor and thrombomodulin, further reflect vascular injury [11]. More recently, alarmins, including ATP and HMGB1 have been also identified as biomarkers associated with severe or fatal outcomes [12].",
            "Cellular infection is initiated by the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [13]. However, other receptors, such as neuropilin-1 and CD147, have also been implicated in facilitating viral entry [14,15]. The generation of S1 and S2 domains of the S protein depends on processing by host proteases tethered at the cell surfaces of epithelial cells, such as TMPRSS2, or, following endocytic internalization of the virus, by lysosomal cathepsins [13]. Further downstream, viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm [16,17], triggering potent innate immune responses [18].",
            "ACE2 expression has been detected in different human tissues and cell types [19]. However, whereas virus infection in alveolar epithelial cells has been well documented [3,20], evidence of productive virus replication in extrapulmonary sites remains limited and controversial, even though damage or dysfunction had been reported in multiple tissues, including the vasculature [21,22].",
            "It was recently proposed that the neurological syndromes associated with long COVID-19 could result from blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption [23]. Although the impact of virus replication in BBB function remains unknown, there is precedent that viral RNA persists in the brain of some individuals for several months [24]. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may reach the CNS by crossing the BBB, either through replication or transcytosis in endothelial cells, or via the extravasation of infected circulating leukocytes, as described for other neuropathogenic viruses [25].",
            "Histopathological analyses, and global single-cell gene and protein expression have shown the presence of ACE2 in the capillary endothelium of the lung, liver, spleen, oral and intestinal mucosa, and brain [19,26]. In addition, viral particles by electron microscopy, as well as histopathological evidence of inflammatory cells and apoptotic signals, were detected in the capillary vessels of post-mortem COVID-19 tissues [27]. However, primary or transformed endothelial cells cultured in vitro have generally shown scanty expression of ACE2, consistent with the fact that they are poorly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection [28,29,30]. Nonetheless, when lung (PMEC) or brain endothelial cells (BMECs) were transfected with hACE2, the release of infectious particles was observed [28]. Still, key aspects such as cell activation, permeability alterations, and response to KKS, along with a detailed investigation of SARS-CoV-2 replication in HBMECs, remain underexplored. Additionally, several studies using different models have highlighted the plasticity of endothelial cells, including their capacity to modulate ACE2 expression in response to environmental signals [31]. Therefore, ACE2 expression and the permissiveness of HBMECs could have been underestimated by in vitro culture conditions.",
            "Beyond serving as the surface receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 has a dual physiological role in vascular homeostasis. This metallopeptidase integrates the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) by converting angiotensin II (AngII) into the anti-inflammatory angiotensin 1– [32,33]. Also, the enzyme plays a pivotal role in the homeostasis of KKS, by degrading des-Arg-bradykinin (DABK) [34]. In the bloodstream, KKS proteolytic cascade involves the activation of plasma kallikreins (PKa), which cleave kininogen (HK), releasing bradykinin (BK). Short-lived BK is either degraded by ACE or induces microvascular leakage by signaling B2R, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) constitutively expressed by the endothelium [35,36]. As the inflammation proceeds, BK is metabolized by kininase I, forming DABK [37]. Differently from the agonist specificity of BK, DABK induces plasma leakage and inflammation by binding to B1R, a GPCR subtype whose expression is strongly upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines [38]. DABK/B1R signaling induces nitric oxide (NO) production, leukocyte recruitment, and increased vascular permeability [36,39,40].",
            "The relevance of ACE2 controlling the DABK/B1R inflammatory axis was evidenced in a mouse model of endotoxin-induced inflammation [41], in which reduced ACE2 activity with impaired DABK degradation was detected. The consequent enhanced B1R signaling resulted in a robust inflammatory response, marked by increased neutrophil infiltration [41]—possibly driven by endothelial activation and permeability. Given the precedent evidence of systemic and pulmonary activation of KKS, as well as increased plasma DABK levels in COVID-19 patients [7,42,43], it is conceivable that ACE2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2 [44,45] might upregulate the extent of B1R-dependent inflammatory edema during the course of infection.",
            "Here, aiming to understand the effect of SARS-CoV-2 replication in endothelial cells from the BBB, we conducted a systematic investigation of viral replication, using HBMEC, a cell line extensively used as a BBB model in other viral infection systems [46,47,48]. To overcome low ACE2 expression, the cells were transduced with hACE2 pseudovirus. Efficient virus replication occurred only when hACE2 was overexpressed. Productively infected HBMEC-ACE2 cells exhibited increased production of inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO), as well as enhanced permeability, with higher virus and leukocyte transmigration. Importantly, our studies demonstrated for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs ACE2-mediated regulation of the proinflammatory DABK/B1R pathway, raising the possibility that pharmacological targeting of the KKS might protect the BBB from excessive injury caused by SARS-CoV-2.",
            "To establish an in vitro BBB model for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection, we investigated whether an HBMEC cell line would support SARS-CoV-2 replication, using a Vero-ACE2 cell line as a gold standard. We first assessed ACE2 receptor expression in HBMECs and found that ACE2 RNA levels were significantly lower than those in Vero-ACE2 cells (Figure 1A). The protein expression was then analyzed by Western blotting using two distinct anti-ACE2 antibodies. ACE2 was undetectable when probed with an antibody specific to the full-length 130KDa protein (Figure 1B), which was reported to localize to the cell surface and contains the catalytic site [49,50]. However, staining with another antibody revealed the presence of ACE2 isoforms, albeit with much weaker immunoreactivity compared to Vero-ACE2 cells (p = 0.0036; Figure 1C). The expression of TMPRSS2 was similar between the two cell lines (Figure 1D). HBMECs were then cultured with SARS-CoV-2 lineages A2, Delta, and Omicron BA5.1 and virus replication was assessed by RT-qPCR and plaque assay at different time points. While Vero-ACE2 cells showed increasing viral RNA levels in both cell lysates and culture medium from 24 to 72 hpi, HBMECs displayed only low levels of genomic and subgenomic RNA with no increase over time (Figure 1E–G). Also, no plaque was detected in HBMECs infected with any virus lineage, whereas virus infectious particles were clearly detected in the supernatants of Vero cells (Figure 1H). No cell death was observed in the HBMEC culture until the endpoint of those assays (Figure 1I).",
            "We then argued whether priming with inflammatory stimuli would modulate ACE2 expression and permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 in HBMECs. HBMEC priming with IFN-β increased ACE2 mRNA, but not protein levels (Figure S1A,B). LPS and TNF treatments did not alter ACE2 expression (Figure S1A,B). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 inoculation in primed cells did not increase the viral RNA copy number in the cell lysates or culture medium (Figure S1C).",
            "To induce ACE2 expression in HBMECs, we developed a lentivirus-based pseudovirus construction carrying ACE2 mRNA (P-ACE2) (Figure 2A). HBMECs transduced with P-ACE2 were viable (Figure 2B) and showed a remarkable increase in ACE2 protein expression, with a peak at 48 h post-transduction (Figure 2C,D).",
            "SARS-CoV-2 replication was then investigated in HBMEC-ACE2, by following the expression of viral RNA, proteins, and the release of infectious particles from 24 to 72 hpi. The concentrations of intracellular genomic and subgenomic RNA copies were higher in HBMEC-ACE2 compared to HBMEC, from 24 hpi, and further increased at 48 hpi (p < 0.05) (Figure 3A,B). J2 antibody staining and immunofluorescence analysis revealed dsRNA-positive cells only in the culture of SARS-CoV-2-infected HBMEC-ACE2, but not in the WT ones (Figure 3D). The viral nucleocapsid protein (N) from all lineages was also exclusively detected in HBMEC-ACE2 cells (Figure 3E). In addition, a significant difference in the amount of released viral RNA was observed at 24 and 48 hpi in HBMEC-ACE2 cells compared to HBMECs (p < 0.0001) (Figure 3C). Importantly, HBMEC-ACE2 released infectious virus particles reaching more than 105 PFU/mL at 48 hpi (Figure 3F,G). Still, none of the experimental settings resulted in significant cell death (Figure 3H and Figure S2).",
            "We subsequently assessed the impact of SARS-CoV-2 replication on molecular parameters implicated in vascular function. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased CCL5 and IL-8 mRNA levels, but not CCL2. CCL5 upregulation occurred only in HBMEC-ACE2 cells infected with native viruses, while IL-8 expression was elevated in both transduced and non-transduced cells. TNF levels were also significantly higher in infected HBMEC-ACE2, but not in WT cells or cultures exposed to inactivated viruses. IL-6 was upregulated in both cell lines upon infection (Figure 4A–C). To further investigate the impact of virus entry on endothelial cell activation, the cells were pretreated with the TMPRSS2 inhibitor camostat mesylate. Camostat was not toxic to HBMEC, and, corroborating the previous results, pretreating HBMEC with the inhibitor reduced both virus replication and the expression of CCL5 and TNF, but not of IL-8 (Figure S3).",
            "SARS-CoV-2 infection did not affect the generation of ROS (Figure 4D). However, enhanced NO production was detected in infected HBMEC-ACE2, but not in WT cells (Figure 4E), showing its dependence on virus replication.",
            "Endothelial permeability of infected cells was then assessed in a transwell system. A significant increase in BSA-FITC extravasation was detected in HBMEC-ACE2 cultures at 48 and 72 hpi (Figure 5A,B). Additionally, infectious virus particles were detected in the lower transwell chamber, indicating virus crosses through the endothelial monolayer (Figure 5C).",
            "Subsequently, HBMEC or HBMEC-ACE2 were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and incubated with CFSE-stained primary human monocytes. Enhanced cellular adhesion was detected in HBMEC-ACE2 infected with native, but not inactivated virus (Figure 5D,E). In another setting, HBMECs were incubated with primary PBMCs in a transwell system, and the number of PBMCs in the lower chamber was counted. A significantly higher number of PBMCs was detected in HBMEC-ACE2 cultures infected with SARS-CoV-2, compared to WT and non-infected cells (Figure 5F), indicating that SARS-CoV-2 replication promoted increased monocyte adhesion and transmigration.",
            "After showing that HBMECs-ACE2 are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we sought to determine whether the transduced ACE2 was enzymatically active in whole cell lysates by measuring the hydrolysis of an intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic substrate, in the presence or absence of the ACE2 inhibitor DX-600. Our results (Figure 6A,B) did not show obvious differences between cell lysates of both cell lines, most likely due to similar levels of intracellular isoforms of ACE2. In an effort to detect enzymatically active ACE2 at the surface of these cultures, the fluorogenic substrate was added to intact cell cultures. Under these conditions, increased hydrolysis was only observed in the HBMEC-ACE2 culture medium, and the reaction was significantly reduced by DX-600 (Figure 6C). Having concluded that ACE2 was enzymatically active at the surface of transduced cells, we next compared the ability of both cell lines to degrade Ang II. To this end, HBMECs or HBMEC-ACE2 were incubated with synthetic Ang II, with or without the specific ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760. Levels of Ang II in the culture medium were determined by ELISA (Figure 6D), and the ratio of Ang II degradation in the presence and absence of the ACE2 inhibitor was calculated. In line with our predictions, ACE2-mediated degradation of Ang II was more accentuated in HBMEC-ACE2 as compared to HBMECs (Figure 6E). We previously showed that the cell line HBMECs constitutively express B1R [51]. We took advantage of B1R expression to monitor DABK-induced NO production in both cell cultures. As expected, HBMECs produced NO in response to DABK, while HBMEC-ACE2 did not (Figure 6F), substantiating the hypothesis that ACE2 transduction translated into DABK degradation.",
            "SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection was previously shown to downmodulate ACE2 [44,45]; therefore, we assessed whether virus replication would modulate the response to DABK. ACE2 expression in the transduced cells was confirmed by Western blotting, and the infection significantly decreased ACE2 at 48 hpi (but not at 24 hpi), in comparison to mock-treated cells (Figure 7A). Corroborating the previous result, functional assays confirmed that the addition of DABK to mock-treated HBMECs, but not HBMEC-ACE2, induced NO production (Figure 7B). In contrast, at 48 hpi, stimulation with DABK increased NO levels in both HBMEC and HBMEC-ACE2, suggesting that virus replication overcame ACE2-mediated downregulation of DABK.",
            "Since ACE2 downregulation is more evident shortly after virus entry [44,45], we assessed the enzyme activity 2 h after SARS-CoV-2 inoculation. Confirming the previous data, the hydrolysis of the ACE2 substrate was significantly increased in HBMEC-ACE2 cultures, compared to control HBMECs (Figure 7C). Notably, SARS-CoV-2 inoculation reduced ACE2-mediated hydrolysis to control levels, comparable to cells treated with the ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760. Additionally, DABK-induced NO production was increased in SARS-CoV-2-infected HBMEC-ACE2, regardless of the virus lineage (Figure 7D).",
            "Finally, we addressed whether virus infection modulated DABK-evoked endothelial permeability. HBMECs or HBMEC-ACE2 were cultured with DABK, with or without the B1R antagonist R954, and the permeability to BSA-FITC was assessed in a transwell system. As predicted, the addition of DABK to HBMECs increased FITC-BSA leakage, but this response was blocked by R954 (Figure 7E). FITC-BSA extravasation was not detected in mock-treated HBMEC-ACE2 stimulated with DABK. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced BSA-FITC extravasation and the permeability of the endothelial barrier was significantly enhanced upon addition of DABK to the cultures. Furthermore, DABK-mediated permeability in infected HBMEC-ACE2 was significantly inhibited by the B1R antagonist. Collectively, these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibits the anti-inflammatory activity of ACE2, rendering the BBB increasingly permeable as a result of hyperactivation of the DABK/B1R pathway.",
            "In the present study, we used a model of HBMECs overexpressing hACE2 to scrutinize aspects of brain endothelial cell function affected by SARS-CoV-2 replication and its impact on disease pathogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate in detail the various steps of viral biosynthesis, from adsorption to the release of infectious particles, providing solid information about HBMEC permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 under in vitro conditions. We showed that ACE2 is essential for virus replication in HBMECs and that downregulation of its activity by SARS-CoV-2 allows increased availability of the vasoactive DABK, resulting in endothelial permeability. This model is particularly relevant for investigating acute and prolonged neurological syndromes, as HBMEC culture represents a simplified model of the BBB, the disruption of which was recently associated with cognitive impairment in long COVID-19 patients [23].",
            "Previous reports investigating endothelial cells infection in vitro demonstrated that primary cells from the lungs, heart, kidney, and brain, as well as immortalized HBMECs, present low ACE2 expression and inefficient SARS-CoV-2 replication [28,30,52,53]. On the other hand, ex vivo models, based on histopathological, single-cell gene, or protein expression analyzes, evidenced ACE2 expression in endothelial cells from human lung, liver, spleen, oral and intestinal mucosa, and brain [19,26], as well as in rodent experimental models [54].",
            "Endothelial cell plasticity and differential responses under resting or inflammatory conditions affect various vascular functions [55,56], potentially impacting ACE2 expression. A previous study found that ACE2 was undetectable in isolated brain cells, but its expression significantly increased in 3D vessel models endothelialized with HUVEC or HBMECs under shear stress [31]. Therefore, ACE2 expression and the permissiveness of HBMECs might have been underestimated by in vitro culture conditions.",
            "Our study, using HBMECs overexpressing ACE2, addresses this issue, showing increased virus adsorption, expression of the N protein and dsRNA, and increasing genomic and subgenomic RNA expression in the cell lysates and culture medium, along with infectious particles release. All these assays indicated that HBMEC-ACE2 were fully permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication, representing a relevant model to investigate the impact of virus infection on endothelial cell function.",
            "Regarding the endothelium associated with the central nervous system, virus-like structures [57] and expression of the spike gene [58] were observed in vascular structures upon histopathological analysis of human post-mortem tissues. A Viral genome was also detected in the brain vascular endothelial cells in hamster and hACE2 transgenic mouse models [54], raising the possibility that endothelial cells were infected by SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. Neurological damage and neuropsychiatric effects are frequently observed in both mild and severe COVID-19 patients, often persisting as long COVID-19 sequelae [23,59]. While BBB damage has been observed [23], its role in virus entry into the CNS remains unclear. Positive PCR results, dsRNA, and S staining in brain autopsies suggest virus invasion [59,60], and viral RNA has been detected in the brain later, after the acute symptoms [24]. However, some studies did not detect viruses in the brains nor in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but evidenced tissue injury and neuroinflammation [61,62].",
            "Understanding the biological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in BBB cells is crucial for addressing both viral invasion and the pathological impact of activated brain endothelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 replication in HBMEC-ACE2 stimulated the expression of chemokines and inflammatory cytokines. The production of CCL5 and TNF was clearly dependent on virus replication, but IL-6 and IL-8 were also induced in non-transduced HBMECs, which may have resulted from S stimulation, as previously reported by others [63,64]. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection increased endothelial permeability, promoting virus crossing and mononuclear cells adhesion and transmigration, dependent on ACE2 expression and productive replication. Accordingly, vascular damage and leakage were evidenced in the brains of COVID-19 patients, along with the presence of monocytes and lymphocytes in perivascular regions [62].",
            "A major finding of our study is that SARS-CoV-2 binding and/or replication resulted in lower ACE2 enzymatic function and increased cell response to the vasoactive peptide DABK. KKS is a major controller of vascular tonus and permeability, and it is tightly regulated by tissue and circulating degrading enzymes to maintain homeostasis. These features represent intrinsic technical challenges in measuring the concentration of KKS elements and assessing their function ex vivo or in vitro. Nonetheless, KKS activation was previously reported, with increased consumption of PKa and HK in patients’ serum/plasma [7,8]. Elevated levels of tissue kallikrein and BK metabolites were also reported in the BALF of COVID-19 patients [42] and S and M proteins were shown to bind HK and FXII, generating BK [65]. Increased expression of both BK receptors had also been observed in circulating and BALF cells from COVID-19 patients, but their functional modulation was not addressed [7,66]. Since ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity promotes DABK degradation, its downregulation by virus infection [45] presumes increased availability of DABK and B1R signaling. Indeed, we showed that HBMEC-ACE2 poorly responds to exogenous DABK, as assessed by NO production and endothelial permeability assays. However, if cells were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, NO production was restored, and permeability was significantly enhanced.",
            "A limitation of our study is the use of a simplified in vitro BBB model that includes only HBMECs, and did not consider the effect of infection in the whole neurovascular unit, including pericytes, astrocytes, and microglia. ACE2 expression was demonstrated in pericytes [67], and infection of these cells and of astrocytes have been suggested [59,67]. Also, evidence of astrogliosis and microgliosis was detected in postmortem samples [68]. Although the KKS has not yet been explored in these cells, their infection or activation, in conjunction with endothelial cells, may further compromise BBB integrity and exacerbate neuroinflammation. This response could be further amplified by endothelial activation with production of TNF, as observed in our model, which may upregulate B1R expression in neighboring cells and enhance KKS activation within the neurovascular unit. Additionally, post-mortem lung biopsies from COVID-19 patients revealed high density of mast cells in alveolar septa and perivascular spaces [69]. It is tempting to speculate that mast cell infiltration and activation in the CNS—leading to the release of polyphosphates, which are known to activate plasma contact factors [70], may contribute to local activation of KKS. This, in turn, could enhance DABK generation and B1R signaling, thereby further amplifying vascular leakage and inflammatory damage. Therefore, the development of more complex multicellular or in vivo models will be essential to fully understand how SARS-CoV-2-mediated dysregulation of the ACE2/KKS/B1R axis contributes to BBB disruption and neurological manifestations of COVID-19.",

            "As COVID-19 continues, a safe, cost-effective treatment strategy demands continued inquiry. Chronic neuroinflammatory disorders may appear to be of little relevance in this regard; often indolent and progressive disorders characterized by neuroinflammation (such as Alzheimer's disease (AD)) are fundamentally dissimilar in etiology and symptomology to COVID-19's rapid infectivity and pathology. However, the two disorders share extensive pathognomonic features, including at membrane, cytoplasmic, and extracellular levels, culminating in analogous immunogenic destruction of their respective organ parenchyma. We hypothesize that these mechanistic similarities may extent to therapeutic targets, namely that it is conceivable an agent against AD's immunopathy may have efficacy against COVID-19 and vice versa. It is notable that while extensively investigated, no agent has yet demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy against AD's cognitive and memory declines. Yet this very failure has driven the development of numerous agents with strong mechanistic potential and clinical characteristics. Having already approved for clinical trials, these agents may be an expedient starting point in the urgent search for an effective COVID-19 therapy. Herein, we review the overlapping Alzheimer's/ COVID-19 targets and theorize several initial platforms."

            "Infection of the CNS with the SARS-CoV-2 can occur via different routes and results in para- or post-infectious manifestations with a variety of neurological symptoms. In patients with neurodegenerative diseases, SARS-CoV-2 is often associated with a higher fatality rate, which is a relevant problem in increasingly older populations. Apart from the direct consequences of an infection in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, indirect consequences of the pandemic such as limited access to care facilities and treatment have negative effects on the course of these chronic disorders. The occurrence of long-lasting neurological symptoms after infection with SARS-CoV-2 indicates a prolonged impact on the CNS. However, while it is known that SARS-CoV-2 affects neuronal populations that are relevant in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, it is yet unclear whether an infection with SARS-CoV-2 is sufficient to trigger neurodegeneration. Reflecting on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on neurodegeneration, we provide a concise overview on the current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2-induced pathology in the CNS and discuss yet open questions in the field.",

            "At the time of writing, almost 500 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (WHO 2022). Early in the pandemic, it became clear that SARS-CoV-2 infections harbor the risk of developing neurological manifestations (Ababneh et al. 2020; Mao et al. 2020). It has also become evident that SARS-CoV-2 infections have a negative effect on the outcome of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, predominantly studied in common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Hu et al. 2021, 2022). In PD, an increased mortality rate was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and an increased hospitalization and mortality rate has been shown for patients with AD (McAlpine et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2020, 2021a). Data on the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections on patients with other neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or Huntington Disease (HD) are yet limited and will require further studies in the course of the pandemic (De Marchi et al. 2021; Musson et al. 2022). Also, chronic neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis with increased disability and a progressive course of disease have been associated with higher mortality rates (Prosperini et al. 2022; Barzegar et al. 2021).",
            "So far, different mechanisms have been considered as a cause of neurological symptoms or acceleration of existing neurological conditions during SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include direct effects of the virus on the central nervous system (CNS) by, e.g., entering the brain via nasal or oral routes and infection of neuronal populations (Meinhardt et al. 2021) and para- or post-infectious effects such as triggering inflammation and auto-immune reactions (Zubair et al. 2020; Franke et al. 2021). Those effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS have potential implications for the development of long-term neurological conditions including neurodegeneration. In addition, systemic effects during severe sepsis can trigger neurological symptoms (Heneka et al. 2020; Widmann and Heneka 2014), and depend on the outcome and management of the acute disease.",
            "In this review article, we will summarize recent evidence of effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the CNS and its implications for neurodegenerative diseases. We identified the existing evidence through author knowledge and PubMed searches from database inception, to March, 2022 using the search terms: “neurofilament”, “neurodegeneration”, “neurodegenerative diseases”, “Parkinson disease”, “Alzheimer disease”, “amyotrophic lateral sclerosis”, “dementia”, “multiple sclerosis”, “Covid-19”, and “SARS-CoV-2”.",
            "When COVID-19 emerged, it became evident that the involved pathogen, the novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, was more transmittable between humans than its predecessor SARS-CoV-1 (Liu et al. 2020b). Similar to its predecessor, SARS-CoV-2 uses the same densely glycosylated spike (S) protein on the viral surface to bind to the peptidase domain of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) on mammalian host cells to enter cells yet with much higher affinity (Wrapp et al. 2020). ACE2 is an extracellular enzyme with a transmembrane domain located toward the cell surface. Upon protease activation, soluble ACE2 is released into the extracellular space, where it physiologically processes angiotensin peptides as part of the angiotensin–renin pathway, while the transmembrane domain of ACE2 is internalized into the cell. During the internalization process, SARS-CoV-2 bound to ACE2 is either taken up by clathrin-coated vesicles or directly through involvement of the ACE2-specific transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2) (Wu et al. 2021). ACE2 is predominantly expressed in airway epithelia and lung parenchyma, kidney cells, small intestine, and vascular endothelia throughout the body, but also widely throughout the CNS (Deinhardt-Emmer et al. 2021). Predilection sites of ACE2 in the brain are the posterior cingulate gyrus, motor cortex, olfactory bulb, middle temporal gyrus, substantia nigra, and the ventricles, where it is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Xia and Lazartigues 2008; Chen et al. 2020).",
            "Loss of smell and taste were among the first CNS-related symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing the early support for the hypothesis of direct entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the brain via the olfactory and oral mucosa. Although loss of smell is a common symptom in COVID-19 patients, its manifestation likely depends on the genetic variability of the virus and its host such as differences in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression (Li et al. 2020; Korber et al. 2020; Shang et al. 2020; von Bartheld et al. 2020; Strafella et al. 2020; Williams et al. 2020). Studies with SARS-CoV-infected mice showed that virus antigen is found in the olfactory bulb and subsequently in connected brain regions such as the piriform cortex, basal ganglia, midbrain, and cardiorespiratory region of the medulla (Netland et al. 2008). The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human brain tissue has been challenging and likely depends on the severity of the CNS involvement. Whereas no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 was found in the brain of 19 infected patients without neurological symptoms (Hirschbuhl et al. 2021), a post-mortem study of 33 SARS-CoV-2 patients with neurological symptoms found viral RNA in the nasal mucosa and to a lesser extend in the ophthalmic and oral mucosa as well as in the medulla oblongata (Meinhardt et al. 2021). This study suggests that infection of the CNS by SARS-CoV-2 in patients with neurological symptoms is mediated by transsynaptic transmission across peripheral olfactory neurons to connected brain areas. Although this study did not detect SARS-CoV-2 in the carotid blood vessels and thus argued against a systemic infection via the blood stream, this route of infection cannot be completely ruled out. In a more detailed study of the olfactory mucosa, the virus was found in sustentacular and stem cells of the mucosa while absent from olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) (Butowt and von Bartheld 2020).",
            "Alternative routes of CNS infection have been described across the blood–brain barrier (BBB), ACE2 expressing vascular endothelial cells, or indirect trafficking of the virus via blood leukocytes under increased permeability of the BBB (Zubair et al. 2020; Gomes et al. 2021). By infecting inflammatory cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes, the virus is able to initiate a cascade of cytokine release and an overwhelming activation of leucocytes which is responsible for subsequent cellular damage. Alternative explanations for SARS-CoV-2 CNS pathogenicity come from its association with auto-immune diseases (Tang et al. 2021). Its complex transcriptome, its ability to mimic human proteins, its ability to promote the generation of autoantibodies, and activate cytokine responses trigger auto-immune responses (Kim et al. 2020; Kanduc 2021; Zhou et al. 2020c). Neuroimmune manifestations such as Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), myasthenia gravis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), or encephalitis suggest an autoantibody-mediated inflammatory response in certain neuronal populations (Toscano et al. 2020; Parsons et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020b; Muhammed et al. 2021; Restivo et al. 2020; Foresti et al. 2021). In blood and CSF of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with neurological symptoms, known autoantibodies against the NMDA-receptor or intracellular Yo-antigen were found, but also antibody binding on yet undetermined antigen epitopes on vessel endothelium, astrocytic proteins, neuropil of basal ganglia, hippocampus, or olfactory bulb from such samples was discovered (Watson et al. 2021; Franke et al. 2021; Mulder et al. 2021). This implies immunosuppressive therapy or plasmapheresis as a possible treatment for autoantibody-associated neurological symptoms.",
            "Neurological symptoms have been described during and post-infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Rifino et al. 2021; Ellul et al. 2020). The clinical presentation of neurological and encephalopathic findings ranged from mild headache and confusion over fluctuating levels of consciousness and extrapyramidal movement disorders (e.g., myoclonus) to seizures and coma (Garg et al. 2021; Romero-Sanchez et al. 2020). Although the number of neurological complications might be lower in SARS-CoV-2 compared to other viruses, the scale of the pandemic renders the overall number of neurological complications and diseases a relevant socioeconomic burden (Ellul et al. 2020). As direct evidence of viral DNA cannot be measured in the CNS of living patients, cerebrospinal fluid is used as an alternative source. However, only two case reports reported positive results for SARS-CoV-2 DNA in the CSF of COVID-19 patients with associated encephalitis, while larger retrospective studies of COVID-19 patients with neurological diseases had negative CSF measurements (Moriguchi et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020a; Destras et al. 2020; Neumann et al. 2020; Bellon et al. 2021). Nevertheless, several case studies confirmed neurological diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mild encephalopathies with transient symptoms such as altered consciousness (19.1% of 841 patients) or bradypsychia and disorientation (10.1% of 841 patients) were found to occur rather commonly often accompanied by findings of unspecific T2/FLAIR hyperintensity (35% of 20 patients) and ischemic infarcts (31% of 108 patients) in neuroimaging (Romero-Sanchez et al. 2020; Mahammedi et al. 2020; Radmanesh et al. 2020). Severe COVID-19-associated encephalopathies including ADEM or acute necrotizing encephalopathies and poly(radiculo)neuropathies as GBS or other acute neuropathies (multifocal demyelinating or small fiber polyneuropathy) have also been described in several case reports with an estimated prevalence of 0.1–1% in western countries within 6 weeks of confirmed infection (Mahapure et al. 2021; Parsons et al. 2020; Shahali et al. 2021; Toscano et al. 2020; Camdessanche et al. 2020; Hayley and Sun 2021; Dixon et al. 2020; Poyiadji et al. 2020; Oaklander et al. 2022). For some entities, a causative relationship to prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is less clear. For example, a large prospective observational study between January and May 2020 could not confirm a higher risk for GBS after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Luijten et al. 2021) and another study of 145.721 cases with COVID-19 showed that GBS had a low pooled prevalence (0.28% within the study cohort) compared to other neurological manifestations (Misra et al. 2021). Among the most common neurological complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are cerebrovascular diseases which are likely associated with a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state in severe infection with elevated C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin (Lodigiani et al. 2020; Benussi et al. 2020). Patients presented with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke or venous thrombosis. In a recent meta-analysis of 145,634 COVID-19 patients, of which 89% were hospitalized, every third patient presented with a neurological manifestation (Misra et al. 2021). A cross-sectional surveillance study in neurology, stroke, psychiatry, and intensive-care units in the UK in April 2020 included 125 patients of which 77 (62%) had a cerebrovascular event (74% ischemic, 12% intracerebral hemorrhage, and 1% vasculitis), while altered mental status was the second most common presentation (Varatharaj et al. 2020). In 267 cases that were followed-up during that time COVID-19 associated stroke was mostly observed in younger adults, delirium was common in patients over 60 years and encephalopathy mostly in patients under 60 years treated on intensive-care units (Ross Russell et al. 2021). Although less frequent, infections with SARS-CoV-2 have also been reported to result in movement disorders (Salari et al. 2021; Hull et al. 2021).",
            "Populations at risk for a deleterious outcome of COVID-19 have been identified early in the pandemic and encompass patients with higher age, male sex, obesity, diabetes, and other comorbidities (Williamson et al. 2020). Patients with neurodegenerative disease are at particular risk, being mostly of higher age and presenting with many relevant comorbidities (Kitani-Morii et al. 2021). Several studies have shown that a pre-existing neurodegenerative disease itself worsens SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. Data derived from meta-analyses and the UK Biobank have shown that dementia is an age-independent risk factor for a deleterious outcome of COVID-19 with increased disease severity and higher likelihood of death compared to non-demented control patients (Tahira et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2020a). This effect has been confirmed for the subgroup of patients with AD, while vascular dementia was not associated with a higher risk (Zhang et al. 2021b). The clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection in patients with concomitant dementia is often atypical with apathy and confusion or hyperactive delirium as leading symptoms, while cough, fever, or dyspnea are less frequent symptoms (Bianchetti et al. 2020; Harb et al. 2021; Mendes et al. 2021; Rebora et al. 2021; Hariyanto et al. 2021). In addition, delirium is an independent factor for worsening the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 including increased fatality (Rozzini et al. 2020; Garcez et al. 2020; Mendes et al. 2021). In most retrospective analyses, a higher case fatality rate has been reported in patients with PD. Particularly, PD patients with longer disease duration and higher age show a high mortality rate of 21–40% during SARS-CoV-2 infections in different cohorts in Italy, the US, and Germany and independent of age, sex and ethnic background (Antonini et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Scherbaum et al. 2021). On the other hand, some studies with smaller sample sizes recruiting patients in tertiary referral centers in Europe and Italy did not find an increased mortality rate in PD nor dementia compared to demographically matched controls (Huber et al. 2021; Fasano et al. 2020).",
            "Data on other neurodegenerative diseases are less extensive. A study using the US veteran database and 699 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) found an increased risk of COVID-19 related death in this cohort (Galea et al. 2021). In a Scottish cohort of 1062 patients with motor neuron disease, 77.7% of whom were diagnosed with ALS, all-cause mortality remained unaffected in 2020, though specific mortality rates of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 are not reported (Glasmacher et al. 2021). Interestingly, C9orf72 repeat expansions of intermediate length, a mutation often found in cases of familial ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), have been associated with severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (Zanella et al. 2021). Multiple sclerosis itself has not been associated with a severe course of disease, whereas increased disability and a progressive course of the disease, which is mainly mediated by neurodegenerative processes, have (Prosperini et al. 2022; Barzegar et al. 2021). Future prospective studies including all healthcare services may shed light on the actual risk of patients with neurodegenerative disorders.",
            "Besides the direct effect of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 on patients with neurodegenerative diseases, the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on these patients due to disruptions in the medical care is equally alarming. Since onset of the global pandemic in late 2019, symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances have been found to have increased in the general public (Thygesen et al. 2021; Bauerle et al. 2020). This is in line with cross-sectional data from more than 5000 patients with PD that revealed worsening of motor (43%) and especially non-motor (52%) symptoms since pandemic onset (Brown et al. 2020). Home confinement and other disease control measures aiming at reduction of contacts are likely to contribute to a diminished physical activity in PD patients (Leavy et al. 2021) and foster the discontinuation of medical treatments, such as multimodal complex treatment or levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) set-ups (Richter et al. 2021; Wolff et al. 2022). Disruptions were furthermore observed to impact clinical trials, due to difficulties in recruitment, initiation and monitoring (Lorusso et al. 2020) which will impact the development of future therapeutic options. Although adaptions such as implementation of remote monitoring and remote study endpoints have been made, they need to be expanded in the future (Snider and Holtzman 2021).",
            "After acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, some of the associated symptoms can persist or additional symptoms can emerge. The British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) distinguishes on one hand ongoing symptomatic COVID-19, defined as persistence of COVID-19-related signs and symptoms up to 12 weeks after infection, from the post-COVID-19 syndrome, defined as the persistence or occurrence of COVID-19-related symptoms 12 weeks after infection (Fig. 1) (NICE 2022). The term “long-COVID” refers to the entirety of symptoms after an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection independent of time and duration and can be considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) since July 2021 (Centers for Disease and Prevention 2021; HHS.gov 2021). Patients suffering from post-COVID-19 syndrome may present with a volatile cluster of symptoms in any system of the body. These may include typical COVID-19-related symptoms such as loss of smell or dyspnea, but also include neurological symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, dizziness, and delirium (NICE 2022). Longitudinal assessment of 9751 patients with COVID-19 found the persistence of COVID-19-related symptoms in 72.5% of the cases after discharge (follow-up range from 29 to 234 days), most prominently shortness of breath or dyspnea (36.0%), and fatigue or exhaustion (40.0%) (Nasserie et al. 2021; Lara et al. 2020). Particularly, the persistence of fatigue or muscle weakness correlated with the need of supplemental oxygen or the need of invasive and non-invasive breathing assistance in hospitalized COVID-19 patients 6 months after discharge (Huang et al. 2021). Both, the pandemic itself, and a previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 have been linked to an increase in distress and depression in the general public (Ramiz et al. 2021; Nasserie et al. 2021). In particular, patients with pre-existing neurodegenerative or chronic neurological diseases are at special risk for this development. Patients with dementia, AD, PD, and multiple sclerosis have been found to suffer from worsening of pre-existing symptoms and de-novo development of neuropsychiatric symptoms, e.g., anxiety and cognitive decline (Lara et al. 2020; Boutoleau-Bretonniere et al. 2020; Wei et al. 2022; Salari et al. 2020; Shalash et al. 2020; Wolff et al. 2022; Haji Akhoundi et al. 2020). This long-lasting impact of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the need for an implementation of a medical care structure for these patients (Gemelli Against 2020).Fig. 1Terms used to describe persisting symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection. NICE, British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; ADA, Americans with Disabilities Act",
            "Terms used to describe persisting symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection. NICE, British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; ADA, Americans with Disabilities Act",
            "The association of neuropsychiatric symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 infection raises the question about the potential long-term impact of the virus on the CNS, its molecular basis, and the potential risk of neuronal damage associated with subsequent development of neurodegenerative diseases. During SARS-CoV infection, there is evidence of scattered degeneration of neurons as a sign of neuronal hypoxia/ischemia (Gu et al. 2005). Sepsis itself has long-term consequences on the brain often associated with delirium and even cognitive decline later in life. Several mechanisms have been discussed to cause neuronal damage during sepsis. First, decreased blood flow caused by reduction in peripheral vascular tone and diminished cardiac output alters brain circulation. Altered microcirculation of the brain, possibly also through an impaired autoregulation caused by increased CO2 levels, leads to detachment of pericytes from the basal lamina and increased permeability of the BBB (Nishioku et al. 2009; Barichello et al. 2021). Sepsis triggers the peripheral innate immune system with an increased secretion of TNF-alpha and interleukins causing endothelial cell damage, disintegration of intracellular junctions, and increased permeability of the BBB. Invasion of T-lymphocytes and macrophages via the BBB activates microglia and astrocytes leading to cerebral cytokine, chemokine, and nitric oxide release, which causes neuronal dysfunction and ultimately cell death (Heneka et al. 2020; Widmann and Heneka 2014). A well-established indicator for neuronal damage is the increase of blood or CSF levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), which is a structural protein and part of the cytoskeleton of long axons. An increase in neurofilament levels has been related to unspecific neuronal damage that can be caused by neuroinflammation, neuronal ischemia, or neurodegeneration (Khalil et al. 2018). Several studies assessed neurofilament levels in SARS-CoV-2 patients. CSF and blood NfL levels were elevated in patients with severe disease and concomitant neurological symptoms (Virhammar et al. 2021; Paterson et al. 2021). Another study evaluated blood NfL levels of 47 SARS-CoV-2 patients at admittance to hospital and showed that a higher baseline NfL level is a negative predictor of survival (Aamodt et al. 2021). Blood NfL was increased in the acute phase of 48 severe and 28 moderate SARS-CoV-2 cases, while after a 6-month follow-up NfL was normalized (Kanberg et al. 2021). To predict the extent of neuronal damage in a cohort of 142 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, Prudencio et al. measured serum NfL at time of hospitalization and at multiple follow-ups (Prudencio et al. 2021). Higher baseline NfL levels indicated worse clinical outcome, while over time NfL levels stayed constant or fluctuated, without a clear correlation to clinical symptoms. Although neurofilaments are an indicator of neuronal damage, it is not yet clear if their elevation indicates a risk for long-term neurodegeneration. To further support neuronal loss, diminished gray matter within the limbic cortical areas with direct neuronal connectivity to the primary olfactory system has been recently described in longitudinal brain imaging after COVID-19 infection (Douaud et al. 2021).",
            "Further evidence of a potential risk for the development of neurodegenerative diseases comes from case reports describing patients with akinetic-rigid parkinsonism following infection with SARS-CoV-2. In addition to improvement of symptoms either under Levodopa/Carbidopa-treatment or spontaneously, all patients displayed abnormal imaging findings, such as decreased dopamine transporter density in dopamine transporter scan or decreased dopamine uptake in 18F-DOPA PET (Cohen et al. 2020; Faber et al. 2020; Mendez-Guerrero et al. 2020). It remains uncertain, if these patients developed the clinical findings de-novo or if a subclinical PD emerged after worsening through severe COVID-19. Causal links of viral infections to neurodegenerative diseases have been drawn since the influenza pandemic in 1918, which is assumed to have caused numerous cases of postencephalitic parkinsonism (Kim et al. 2015; Hoffman and Vilensky 2017; Bigman and Bobrin 2018). This theory was further fueled by the fact that the substantia nigra represents a potential target for neurovirulent influenza A viruses (Takahashi et al. 1995). This is also true for coronaviruses, which have been shown to accumulate in the nucleus subthalamicus and the substantia nigra after infection in mice (Fishman et al. 1985). Furthermore, elevated titers of antibodies directed against coronaviruses have been found in patients with PD (Fazzini et al. 1992). ACE2 has not only been found to be expressed by midbrain dopaminergic neurons, but dopaminergic neurons were also permissive for an infection with SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro (Yang et al. 2020). Further evidence for the involvement of the midbrain during COVID-19 was added by the fact that post-mortem analysis of patients with COVID-19 revealed activated microglia and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in the brainstem and cerebellum (Matschke et al. 2020). By infiltration of viruses to the CNS, neuroinflammation can be triggered, resulting in a disruption of the BBB, microglia activation, and clustering of microglia around (dopaminergic) neurons, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine release. This is thought to result in a vicious circle of self-driven neuroinflammation, eventually resulting in neurodegeneration (Limphaibool et al. 2019). In PD, there is strong evidence suggesting alpha-synuclein pathology propagates from the olfactory bulb and/or the gut to the brain, which is associated with early non-motor symptoms such as olfactory disfunction and obstipation (Braak et al. 2003; Haehner et al. 2011). Olfactory dysfunction, in particular loss of smell, is also a common symptom of COVID-19. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have been shown to be expressed in human olfactory mucosa and therefore pose a possible entry site of SARS-CoV-2 to the brain, which is shared by alpha-synuclein pathology (Fig. 2; Brann et al. 2020). Additionally, viral infections were found to increase alpha-synuclein expression levels in rodents and to induce the formation of cytotoxic alpha-synuclein aggregates (Beatman et al. 2015; Bantle et al. 2019). Whether and in what way these findings might contribute to the development of PD is unknown. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to also influence other proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD: the expression of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S has been linked to an increased spreading of Tau and cytosolic prions in-vitro and further prompted the aggregation of these proteins (Liu et al. 2021). A shift in localization of Tau from axons to the soma and hyperphosphorylation of Tau, both hallmarks of early stages of tauopathy, have been observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected neurons, resulting in cell death in 3D human brain organoids (Ramani et al. 2020). In Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the main pathological protein found aggregated in the cytoplasm of neurons leading to progressive degeneration of motor neurons is TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). In 10% of ALS cases, a known gene mutation underlies the disease, while in the majority of sporadic ALS patients, a multi-hit hypothesis of internal and external factors including environmental risk factors has been considered (Brown and Al-Chalabi 2017). A viral infection of specific neuronal populations such as motor neurons might lower the threshold for developing TDP-43 pathology as proposed in the multistep hypothesis for ALS (Chio et al. 2018). In summary, there is growing evidence of COVID-19 associated neuropathological effects and SARS-CoV-2 may be impacting many pathways involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Whether this is sufficient to induce neurodegeneration and whether the human nervous system is able to counteract and regenerate is subject of ongoing research. Longitudinal data will be needed to evaluate the relevance of this impact on patients diagnosed with COVID-19.Fig. 2SARS-CoV-2 and neurodegenerative diseases. a Clinical presentation: SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to neurological symptoms and disorders (e.g., loss of smell, altered mental status, and stroke), severe sepsis, or worsening of neurodegenerative diseases.

            "This short review summarizes molecular and clinical evidence of CNS affection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus with particular reference to neurodegenerative disorders. Many questions, however, prevail. Although it is known that COVID-19 can cause neuronal damage as indicated by increased neurofilament levels, it is unresolved whether the CNS is able to recover completely or only partially from this damage and what the delay of such a recovery might be. Even less clear is whether such damage to the CNS triggers neurodegenerative diseases and with which latency the (clinical) onset of such diseases might be expected. Which genetic predispositions or environmental factors could modulate these outcomes? Are all viral strains/variants of concern equally dangerous in this regard? We also do not know whether long-COVID or post-COVID-19 syndrome predisposes to such potential long-term consequences. We know that vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is a powerful means to prevent a severe course of disease in the general public (Thompson et al. 2021; Lin et al. 2022; Rosenberg et al. 2022; Hippisley-Cox et al. 2021). Data on the safety and effectiveness of the available vaccines in the vulnerable population of patients with neurodegenerative diseases are lacking and urgently needed (Shi et al. 2021). It is also not clear to date whether vaccination also prevents potential neurodegeneration as sequelae of COVID-19 and what the role of different vaccines may be. Only longitudinal studies with large cohorts and appropriate controls will be able to solve these questions in the future (Horn et al. 2021).",

            "In less than 6 months, the severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus type 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has spread worldwide infecting nearly 6 million people and killing over 350,000. Initially thought to be restricted to the respiratory system, we now understand that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) also involves multiple other organs, including the central and peripheral nervous system. The number of recognized neurologic manifestations of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is rapidly accumulating. These may result from a variety of mechanisms, including virus‐induced hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states, direct virus infection of the central nervous system (CNS), and postinfectious immune mediated processes. Example of COVID‐19 CNS disease include encephalopathy, encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, meningitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, venous sinus thrombosis, and endothelialitis. In the peripheral nervous system, COVID‐19 is associated with dysfunction of smell and taste, muscle injury, the Guillain‐Barre syndrome, and its variants. Due to its worldwide distribution and multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms, COVID‐19 poses a global threat to the entire nervous system. Although our understanding of SARS‐CoV‐2 neuropathogenesis is still incomplete and our knowledge is evolving rapidly, we hope that this review will provide a useful framework and help neurologists in understanding the many neurologic facets of COVID‐19.

            "Growing evidence links COVID-19 with acute and long-term neurological dysfunction. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms resulting in central nervous system involvement remain unclear, posing both diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Here we show outcomes of a cross-sectional clinical study (NCT04472013) including clinical and imaging data and corresponding multidimensional characterization of immune mediators in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of patients belonging to different Neuro-COVID severity classes. The most prominent signs of severe Neuro-COVID are blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment, elevated microglia activation markers and a polyclonal B cell response targeting self-antigens and non-self-antigens. COVID-19 patients show decreased regional brain volumes associating with specific CSF parameters, however, COVID-19 patients characterized by plasma cytokine storm are presenting with a non-inflammatory CSF profile. Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome strongly associates with a distinctive set of CSF and plasma mediators. Collectively, we identify several potentially actionable targets to prevent or intervene with the neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "Both acute and chronic COVID-19 disease (also known as long-COVID) may affect the central nervous system. Here authors characterize the immunological profile of peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid of COVID-19 patients in order to identify the main factors that contribute to neurological impairment and the severity of neurological symptoms in Sars-CoV-2 infection.",
            "The prevalence of neurological symptoms (NS) after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, altogether termed “Neuro-COVID”, differs significantly between studies and can rarely be explained by direct virus effects1,2. In support of a detrimental immune response, neuropathological evidence of hyperactive microglia has been provided3, and postmortem studies postulate activated microglia as a dominant immune cell population in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) brains. In autoptic single cell RNA sequencing studies, COVID-19 brains display dysregulated astrocytic and microglial signatures4, accompanied by deranged choroid plexus cell types5,6. Additionally, the formation of microglia and T-cell nodules were detected across brain compartments as a site of greatest T cell and microglia activation1. Accordingly, specific immune alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Neuro-COVID patients featured an increase of exhausted T cells, probably due to repetitive stimulation. Hence, these observations indicate a compromised antiviral response pointing towards immune-mediated mechanisms responsible for severe Neuro-COVID2,7.",
            "There is strong evidence of brain-related pathologies in COVID-19. Schwabenland et al.1 confirmed the presence of amyloid precursor protein deposits in COVID-19 brains, suggesting axonal damage as a result of immune activation. Accordingly, Douaud et al.8 identified a reduction in gray matter thickness in primary olfactory cortex regions, and a reduction in brain size in a longitudinal study of COVID-19-related brain pathologies. However, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has rarely been detected in the CSF of COVID-19 patients, even in those displaying NS2,9,10. Moreover, new-onset humoral autoimmunity, including antineuronal antibodies, in COVID-19 individuals has been observed, even in the absence of increased conventional inflammatory CSF parameters and lacking evidence of inflammation upon neuroimaging11,12. Yet, it still remains controversial whether these alterations represent specific central nervous system (CNS) infection or are bystander effects of systemic COVID-19.",
            "Here, we perform an in-depth characterization of immune mediators in the CSF and plasma of clinically well-characterized Neuro-COVID patients and correlate these findings with brain imaging data and a 13-month follow-up. A vigorous microglia reactivity, a dysfunctional blood-brain barrier (BBB) and CNS ingressing B cells mainly characterized severe Neuro-COVID. We observe a plasma cytokine storm combined with a non-inflammatory CSF profile, even in severe Neuro-COVID. However, particular CSF and plasma inflammatory parameters are associated with decreased regional brain volumes in COVID-19 patients and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. These findings may be addressed to prevent COVID-19 related neurological impairment in the future.",
            "In total, we screened 310 patients in order to reach a target study population of 40 (mean [SD] age, 54 [20] years; 17 women [42%]) participants (Fig. 1a). One patient did not meet our inclusion criteria (≥18 years, non-pregnant, positive PCR test) due to pregnancy. The other 269 screened patients declined participation, mostly because of fear of lumbar puncture (LP) side effects. In 5/40 (12.5%) cases, LP failed to deliver sufficient CSF amounts, precluding further downstream analysis. Within these patients, 1 suffered from multiple sclerosis (MS), which in consequence did not influence our CSF analysis.Fig. 1CONSORT diagram and schemes illustrating the project design.a Consort flow diagram.

Neurological symptom severity was assessed (1) according to Fotuhi et al.13 and (2) on our clinical experience. Class I was defined by absent/mild NS, including headache, dizziness, anosmia and ageusia. Class II encompassed moderate NS, including fatigue, acute peripheral neuropathy and myopathy, whereas class III was specified by severe NS, including seizures, stroke or intracranial hemorrhage, encephalopathy, coma or death. Additionally, we assessed COVID-19 severity (not focusing on NS) using the WHO clinical progression score14.

            "To evaluate the B-cell response of patients having mild or severe symptoms, we sequenced Ig heavy chain CDR3 (complementarity determining region 3) in RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of four class I and class III patients each (Supplementary Table 3). First, we found a significantly higher number of plasma B-cell clones in class I compared to class III. The number of B-cell clones correlated with increased plasma IgG levels suggesting that the number of unique B cells in the blood might be an indicator of high IgG production (Fig. 3a). There was no significant difference in Shannon diversity and evenness between cohorts15. Both groups had an evenness value close to 1 indicating a polyclonal distribution of B-cell clones15 (Fig. 3b). Indeed, only two patients from class I had B-cell clones accounting for more than 5% of all B-cell clones. In contrast, all class III patients showed a more polyclonal distribution without an expanded high frequency B-cell clone (Fig. 3c). B-cell clones of both class I and class III patients showed a similar Gaussian CDR3 length distribution with a similar mean CDR3 length (Fig. 3d). Taken together, BCR sequencing analysis revealed a more specific antibody response in class I patients, whereas in class III patients the response was more diverse due to polyclonality.Fig. 3B-cell receptor sequencing reveals a more specific antibody response and a higher B-cell clone number in class I patients, whereas class III patients depicted a more diverse response due to polyclonality.a Box plot representation of B-cell clone number in class I (n = 4) and class III patients (n = 4) respectively.

            "To further elucidate mechanisms associated with Neuro-COVID, and to identify class-specific secretome patterns, we performed targeted soluble CSF and plasma proteomics. We identified predominant plasma secretion of a large number of soluble proteins in Neuro-COVID class III patients compared to controls (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 2a), suggesting a Neuro-COVID class-dependent plasma signature. Class I and II patients had an increased plasma secretome compared to controls, in line with the previously described peripheral cytokine storm in COVID-1916. The CSF protein pattern was different: while class I and II depicted relatively similar profiles as healthy controls, a Neuro-COVID class III-specific signature with differences to CNS inflammatory controls emerged (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 2b). Notably, CSF total protein levels progressively increased from class I to III, indicating a correlation between CSF proteomics and NS (Fig. 4a).Fig. 4Neuro-COVID patients display a vigorous peripheral immune response and specific CSF alterations including analytes with high predictive value for class III development and strong CSF-plasma correlation.a Rose plots representing Z-scores of marginalized normalized protein expression (NPX) of 192 soluble proteins in CSF and plasma.

            "Next, we investigated the relative concentration of each molecule between CSF and plasma (log2 normalized CSF/plasma index) to ascertain whether they result from intrathecal or peripheral synthesis. We found that most proteins were intrathecally (CSF/plasma ratio >0) secreted in CNS inflammatory controls, whereas proteins in COVID-19 patients were mainly peripherally synthesized (CSF/plasma ratio <0). Of note, TRANCE/RANKL was the only intrathecally synthesized protein in class III compared to CNS inflammatory controls (Supplementary Fig. 3, rose plots, Supplementary Fig. 4, heatmaps, Supplementary Data 3, 4).",

In one class I patient, we detected hyperintense signal alterations in the left cerebellar hemisphere (Fig. 7d) and in the left frontal juxtacortical region on DWI (Fig. 7e), suggesting small territory acute diffusion restriction. The other two patients’ brain scans demonstrated nonspecific white matter hyperintensities on FLAIR/T2w imaging (Fig. 7f). In the class III patient with MRI and subsequent CT scan, the MRI scan was unremarkable, whereas the CT depicted right sided cerebellar infarction (Fig. 7c).",
            "To identify implications of the deranged protein landscape to brain integrity, we assessed GMVs in different brain areas and their association to routine and experimental CSF and plasma parameters. There were no significant differences between the Neuro-COVID group and the imaging control group in age, sex and global brain variables (Supplementary Table 5).",
            "After false discovery rate (FDR) correction, we identified 16 specific brain regions that were negatively correlated to the CSF leukocyte count, protein levels and the CSF/plasma albumin ratio (p < 0.05) (Fig. 7g–j, Supplementary Table 6). Thereof, 81% corresponded to the olfactory and gustatory cortex’s telencephalic connections, including the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, basal ganglia, cingulate gyrus and orbitofrontal areas (Fig. 7g–j).",
            "Alternatively, we investigated the correlation of CSF and plasma mediators with decreased regional GMVs. For instance, high plasma levels of BMP-4 and GDF-8 were associated with preserved regional GMVs (Supplementary Fig. 7), whereas PD-L1 and HGF were associated with decreased GMVs in specific brain regions (Supplementary Fig. 8). Additional proteins associated with GMV alterations are depicted in Supplementary Fig. 9. However, none of the p values were significant after BH procedure, highlighting the need for larger sample sizes and targeted analysis of these plasma proteins.",
            "We further investigated the potential of CSF and plasma proteins to predict long-COVID in a 13 months follow-up. Long-COVID was defined according to the WHO consensus definition38. Deceased patients were not taken into account for the long-COVID prediction analysis.",
            "Detailed results of the 13 months follow-up are described in Table 1. Due to the high mortality rate and patients lost to follow-up within class III (5/15 patients deceased, 7 lost to follow-up), we performed only 3 follow-ups in this group. Out of the deceased patients, three died during their hospital stay and 2 during the follow-up period. Class II and III patients were more often affected by long-COVID compared to class I. In class I, 11/18 patients recovered without long-term deficits, whereas 6/7 class II and 3/3 patients in class III had long-COVID. Furthermore, the death of a class I patient 3 months after COVID-19 was caused by known end-stage heart failure.",
            "Using an AUC cut-off of >0.75, high single plasma CLM-6 (CD300c), MCP-339,40, and low RGMA41 levels were predictive for long-COVID (Fig. 8a).

Compared to previous analyses, we studied the associations of peripheral inflammation, neuroinflammation and NS multidimensionally within prospectively stratified Neuro-COVID classes and COVID-19 severity degrees.",
            "In line with other studies, we found elevated CSF glucose and lactate levels in class III patients. Indeed, patients suffering from diabetes type II were more prevalent in class III (Table 1). Nonetheless, the CSF/plasma glucose ratio was significantly higher in class III patients compared to class II patients, pointing towards not only diabetes-related causes of elevated CSF glucose levels. The elevated lactate levels in class III potentially hint at cerebral hypoxia. For instance, class III patients had putative COVID-19-induced stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage, which may explain this finding.",
            "Notably, we identified a class III-specific humoral CSF immune response encompassing enrichment of (total) IgG/IgA against self-(dsDNA) and non-self (BSA) antigens. This finding is corroborated by distinct plasma B-cell clusters and CSF antibody reactivity profiles previously reported12. Certainly, antibody production predominantly took place in the plasma, pointing to an ingress of peripherally activated B cells and antibodies. In line with recent findings identifying new-onset autoantibodies in patients with COVID-19, our identification of elevated anti-dsDNA IgG, which are associated with cardiovascular symptoms in systemic lupus, may provide a potential pathophysiological rationale for cardiovascular risk factors in severe COVID-1911,12,35,50–52. Indeed, two out of four class lll patients with vascular complications had increased levels of anti-dsDNA IgG in the CSF.",
            "Our observation of elevated anti-gut microbial IgA antibodies supports the evidence for gut barrier dysfunction in severe COVID-19 that may necessitate containment of gut microbiota translocated to the circulation and possibly the CSF53–55. In that regard, underlying conditions for microbiota dysbiosis, such as increased age, hypertension and diabetes have been observed in our class III cohort (Table 1). Alternatively, trafficking of commensal-reactive regulatory B cells to sites of neuroinflammation as recently described may underlie these findings56,57. Our observations shed new light on mucosal barrier disruption as a modulator of the peripheral host immune response. While we cannot exclude that the differences in class III are due to pre-existing antibody profiles, the class-dependent increase in polyclonal antibody responses argues for a COVID-19-related pathophysiology and is corroborated by recent findings identifying new-onset autoantibodies in patients with COVID-1911.",
            "Intriguingly, total CSF antibody levels were significantly higher in class III compared to class I/II patients (Supplementary Fig. 1d), representing a severity-dependent, compartmentalized B-cell response, likely induced by BBB disruption.",
            "Based on the results of our BCR sequencing, patients producing more B-cell clones in the periphery may develop milder disease for two reasons: First, these patients produced higher levels of total IgG, which might be protective, and second, the expanded clones produced more specific antibodies in comparison to severely affected patients. In class III patients, the antibody response might be more diverse due to enhanced polyclonality, reflecting an unspecific and dysregulated immune activation, as seen in autoimmune diseases12,58.",
            "Higher CSF protein, albumin, CSF/plasma ratio and IgM, IgG and IgA levels, and intrathecal detection of peripherally produced SARS-CoV-2 S-antibodies underscored BBB impairment in class III patients. Of note, SARS-CoV-2 S-antibody levels increase with a decreasing viral load59, explaining our low detection rate.",
            "In line with prior research16,17, we observed a class-incremental cytokine storm in plasma, but less prominent in the CSF. Intriguingly, class III patients displayed a unique CSF protein pattern highlighting BBB disruption, microglia regulation and neuronal tissue damage. TNFRSF12A displayed a high CSF-plasma correlation and predictive value for class III development, rendering it a predictive biomarker for severe Neuro-COVID given its involvement in BBB disruption during CNS immune cell recruitment60,61. Further, IL-8, VEGFA and EN-RAGE promoted class III inherent BBB impairment, reinforcing ingress of polyreactive antibodies into the CSF22,27,62–64.",
            "Notably, several of the proteins with higher CSF and plasma levels in class III patients were associated with COVID-19 severity14. Plasma 4E-BP1, MSR1, IL-8 and IL-6 as well as CSF TNFRSF12A, TNFRSF11B, CLEC10A, PD-L1 and EZR were associated with COVID-19 severity and Neuro-COVID, highlighting the role of the previously described cytokine storm, the innate immune system, particularly microglia overactivation, and a dysfunctional BBB in progressive COVID-1918,19,22,27,45,46,65.",
            "Exploiting microglia, neuronal markers and neuroimaging, we investigated consequences of COVID-19-induced BBB impairment on cerebral integrity. TNFRSF11B, a decoy receptor for TRANCE (RANKL), was the sole CSF discriminant between class III and CNS inflammatory controls, leading to microglia overstimulation45. Importantly, we detected concurring elevated TRANCE (RANKL) CSF/plasma ratios in class III, which underscores the relevance of increased TNFRSF11B levels. Targeting TNFRSF11B, e.g., by TRANCE (RANKL) mimics46, could attenuate microglia activity in Neuro-COVID. Another relay of propagating the peripheral inflammation to the brain is represented by elevated MSR1 levels66 followed by elevated CD200R1 levels in class III. Altogether, this suggests microglial activation and its possible consequences in severe Neuro-COVID.",
            "Brain imaging revealed findings in class III patients, while most class I/II patients lacked evidence of profound alterations. Findings in class I/II patients mainly consisted of white matter FLAIR/T2w abnormalities, which have a broad spectrum of differential diagnoses, and are common in the elderly52,67,68. Therefore, we cannot deduct a causality of COVID-19 and unspecific brain imaging changes, which necessitates pre-COVID-19 scans. However, 3/6 patients with pre-COVID scans from our cohort had novel alterations, pointing towards a possible association with the disease. Further, COVID-19 has been postulated to cause endothelial dysfunction, microangiopathy and a prothrombotic state, possibly explaining the impressive pathologies observed in our class III patients52,69. Nonetheless, the underlying pathomechanisms resulting in brain imaging abnormalities and the direct implication of SARS-CoV-2 remain unsolved. Further, particularly longitudinally designed studies assessing pre- and post-COVID-19 brain scans could help identify potential pathomechanisms related to SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Recently, a large scale, longitudinal volumetric brain imaging study of COVID-19 patients reported results in line with our findings8. However, the authors did not report associations of volumetric brain alterations with particular CSF and plasma biomarkers. In our cohort, GMVs of olfactory pathway regions were negatively correlated with the CSF/plasma albumin ratio, CSF leukocytes and protein levels in COVID-19 patients. The pattern of decreased GMVs, particularly in olfactory pathway structures, is consistent with reports of decreased glucose metabolism in fronto-parietal and temporal regions8. Maybe, the higher CSF glucose levels and CSF/plasma glucose ratios in severe Neuro-COVID can be explained by a lower glucose turnover of the brain, particularly in regions where GMVs were negatively associated with inflammatory CSF parameters. Likewise, some of these regions with decreased GMVs have overlapping olfactory- and memory-related functions, which may explain long-term neurological sequelae, such as memory or concentration problems after COVID-198.",
            "In line with previous research, high PD-L1 and HGF plasma levels were associated with COVID-19 severity17,30. Potentially, PD-L1 blockade would counteract the previously described immune dysregulation30. Conversely, HGF, reported to mediate tissue-regenerative responses in COVID-19-induced lung damage17, might serve as a counter-regulatory factor promoting neuroregeneration upon neuronal tissue damage. Also, high PD-L1 and HGF plasma levels were associated with decreased GMVs in particular brain regions in other contexts17,30, whereas BMP-4 and GDF-8 were associated with preserved volumes32,70,71. However, the results were not significant, which could be explained by the low number of patients providing both CSF/plasma and required MRI sequences for brain volumetric analysis. Associating PD-L1 and HGF levels with volumetric brain changes in a larger patient population could provide new actionable targets to prevent short- and long-term neurological sequelae. Recently, work from ref. 72 pointed at the impact of CCL-11 on neuronal damage and microglia activation in COVID-19, corroborating the impact of peripheral cytokines on neuronal and microglial pathology in COVID-19.",
            "Our long-term follow-up suggests that class II and III patients continued to be more frequently affected by long-COVID compared to class I patients. Furthermore, we identified CSF levels of pro-inflammatory proteins (TNFRSF9, IFN-γ) and lacking anti-inflammatory mediators (TRANCE(RANKL), TRAIL) to be predictive for long-COVID, whereas plasma CLM-6, MCP-3 and ST1A1 revealed potential for long-COVID forecast39,40. The association of particular pro-inflammatory cytokines and long-COVID, amongst others IFN-γ, have been previously described by Phetsouphanh et al.73 and is in line with our finding of elevated CSF IFN-γ levels in long-COVID.",
            "MCP-3 is crucial for efficient macrophage infiltration into the CNS40,74, disclosing a dominant role of the innate immune system in COVID-19-related long-term NS. Furthermore, CLM-6 upregulation reflects a pronounced monocyte activation, underscoring the connection of innate immune effectors with long-COVID development39. Strikingly, ST1A1 was upregulated in an experimental autoimmune encephalitis model42, pointing at autoimmune mechanisms in COVID-19, and aligning with autoreactive antibodies in severe COVID-19 and Neuro-COVID. Recently, work from Su et al. pointed at the association of atypical memory B cells, exhibiting lower levels of somatic hypermutation and enhanced BCR and IFN signaling in long-COVID, sharing pathomechanisms with systemic lupus. This observation is in line with our finding of elevated mediators of autoimmunity and emphasizes the involvement of autoimmune mechanisms in long-COVID development.",

The lambda hyper-parameter (corresponding to the strength of the regularization term), was selected to minimize the Bayesian Information Criterion, or the Akaike Information Criterion when the BIC pointed to the null model. While this modeling approach is appropriate to the nature of the data, the absence of several categories from our sample as well as the poor predictive performance of the predictive model led us to complement this approach with simple linear regression models. We fitted Gaussian linear models with an L1 norm, using a 10-fold cross-validation, as implemented in the glmnet R package [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/citation.html]. We kept the model, which minimized the cross-validated mean squared error and the most-regularized model such that the cross-validated error is within one standard error of the minimum. We assessed the assumptions of these Gaussian models and found them appropriate. Finally, we cross-referenced the results from each of the four models (backward-ordinal, forward-ordinal, best linear, most-regularized ordinal) to provide a robust modeling choice of sets of molecular markers of COVID-19 severity.",

            "We ranked molecules by the AUC-ROC score of their marginalized data to discriminate between patients who developed long-COVID and patients who did not. Subsequently, we trained logistic regression models with, respectively, the plasma and CSF molecules whose individual AUC-ROC was above 0.75. The logistic regression models were reduced using backward selection in order to limit overfitting and provide minimal sets of molecules sufficient to predict long-COVID. AUC-ROC cut-offs applied for minimal sets of predictive molecules were 0.7. The reduced model contained 4 plasma and 3 CSF molecules. Given our sample size, we kept the entirety of the data as a training set and reported the testing set. However, we assessed the robustness of our reduced sets of molecular markers using 5-Fold cross-validation.",

Written informed consent has been provided by each participant. If participants were not able to provide consent their relatives provided informed written consent. Imaging studies were conducted on a 1.5 Tesla (T) MAGNETOM Siemens Avanto Fit and a 3 T MAGNETOM Siemens Skyra Scanner. MRI sequences included 3D T1-weighted (T1w) +/− gadolinium, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and T2-weighted (T2w) sequences to document signs of neuroinflammation. For standardization of MRI interpretation, an assessment protocol was created (Supplementary Data 9). Anatomical T1w MPRAGE pulse sequences were acquired for brain volumetric analysis. CT scans were assessed according to clinical standards. Two neuroradiologists (J.M.L. and M-N.P.) reviewed the images, blinded to clinical and laboratory patient data.",

To generate a bigger sample size, 13 additional patients who underwent brain MRI during their acute phase of COVID-19 were retrospectively added. These patients were not included in the main study cohort, undergoing CSF and plasma analysis. Consequently, the COVID-19 volumetric imaging cohort consisted of 35 participants (mean [SD] age, 52 [20] years; 21 women (60%).",

            "The 3D high-resolution T1w anatomical images were acquired using two MRI scanners (scanner 1: 1.5 T Siemens Avanto Fit; scanner 2: 3 T Siemens Skyra). An MPRAGE pulse sequence covering the whole brain was used in both MRI scanners with the following parameters. Scanner 1: 160 contiguous slices of 1 mm thickness in sagittal orientation; in-plane FOV = 256 × 256 mm2, and matrix size 256 × 256 yielding an in-plane spatial resolution of 1 × 1 mm2 and voxel size of 1 × 1 × 1 mm3. The echo (TE), repetition (TR), and inversion (TI) times were set to TE/TR/TI = 2.8 ms/2400 ms/900 ms with a flip angle FA = 8°. Scanner 2: 160 contiguous slices of 1 mm thickness in sagittal orientation; in-plane FOV = 256 × 240 mm2, and matrix size 256 × 240 yielding an in-plane spatial resolution of 1 × 1 mm2 and voxel size of 1 × 1 × 1 mm3. The echo, repetition, and inversion times were set to TE/TR/TI = 2.98 ms/2300 ms/900 ms with a flip angle FA = 9°.

These variables were available for the main COVID-19 study cohort, which was under CSF and plasma evaluation.",
            "The anatomical T1w images were automatically parcellated into 132 brain regions based on Neuromorphometrics atlas using the Neuromorphometrics toolbox. The atlasing methodology consists of two main steps. First, each image is segmented into three different brain tissue classes (CSF, gray matter, and white matter) using the “Segment” (unified segmentation) tool in SPM12 (Statistical Parametric Mapping Toolbox), which includes registration to the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) space. Second, the probabilistic atlas of each of the anatomical structures is spatially registered with the extracted gray and white matter tissue maps using the “Shoot” tool in SPM12, based on a nonlinear advanced registration algorithm78. Rules of probability are used to combine the previous images to obtain a probabilistic label map for each brain structure. At every gray matter voxel (in subject space), the probability of belonging to a specific anatomical structure is provided. From above, maximum probability label maps are calculated at all gray matter voxels (in subject space) which are labeled according to the structure of maximum probability. Finally, mean gray matter volume (GMV) values are calculated across voxels belonging to each structure label (Supplementary Data 10). The total intracranial volume (TIV) was computed as the sum of gray and white matter and cerebrospinal fluid volumes in cm3. Normalized GMV is defined as the ratio between GMV and TIV. To control for head size, we adjusted the statistical models for TIV measured by SPM12.",
            "We checked the normal distributions of all variables using Shapiro-Wilk tests and visual inspection of the histograms. To test the equality of variances, Levene’s test was applied. Clinical and demographic variables were compared between groups with Independent t-test, Mann–Whitney-U test, or Chi-square tests where appropriate. Regional volumes were compared between groups using a linear regression model. The additional covariates were age, sex, age*sex interaction, MRI magnetic field strength, and TIV. Choroid plexus volume (CPV) was adjusted for TIV and was compared by Mann–Whitney-U test. We checked whether the dependent variable’s variance is equal between the groups by performing Levene’s test of equal variances. The p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using FDR. The associations between brain regional volume and clinical measures were assessed using partial correlation. The method allows calculating the linear partial correlation between our variables of interest adjusting for different covariates. Our covariates were: age, sex, age*sex interaction, MRI magnetic field strength, and TIV. We adjusted for multiple comparisons using an FDR method. The statistical analysis was performed using the JASP software (https://jasp-stats.org/). For the partial- correlation analysis, we used MATLAB software (‘partialcorri.m’ function) (https://www.mathworks.com/).",

            "Neurosurgery as one of the most technologically demanding medical fields rapidly adapts the newest developments from multiple scientific disciplines for treating brain tumors. Despite half a century of clinical trials, survival for brain primary tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary brain cancer, or rare ones including primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), is dismal. Cancer therapy and research have currently shifted toward targeted approaches, and personalized therapies. The orchestration of novel and effective blood–brain barrier (BBB) drug delivery approaches, targeting of cancer cells and regulating tumor microenvironment including the immune system are the key themes of this review. As the global pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 virus continues, neurosurgery and neuro-oncology must wrestle with the issues related to treatment-related immune dysfunction. The selection of chemotherapeutic treatments, even rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) that occur among immunocompromised people, and number of vaccinations they have to get are emerging as a new chapter for modern Nano neurosurgery.",
            "The term “nano neurosurgery “is less than two decades old. In 2003, Dunn and Black for the first time proposed it to use for glioma therapies on a molecular scale [1]. Nanomaterials for nano neurosurgery as imaging and treatment agents are selected for a number of criteria corresponding to the “brain rules”: 1. Neuroprotection and lack of neurotoxicity, 2. Ability to be delivered through BBB, 3. Pharmacological criteria, which are prolongation of plasma circulation, tumor accumulation and cancer cell retention, 4. Specific targeting of a brain cell type, 5. Immunomodulation of the brain privileged immune system, and 6. Resensitization to the other treatment’s effects (e.g., rendering more sensitive to radiation and chemo-, thermo-and immuno-therapy).",
            "The tendency in modern neurosurgery is to minimize surgical invasiveness by incorporating novel imaging techniques and personalized surgical and treatment approaches. The theranostic approach, that is, the ability to deliver imaging and therapeutic agents to the tumor site and tumor cells using one nano agent hold great promise. Molecular imaging with the development of long-term circulating and targeting agents expands the options for both diagnostic and therapeutical strategies [2], [3], [4]. Nano-pharmacology in this setting allows for systemic drug administration to enhance drug concentrations in the tumors to maximize efficacy and minimize systemic and neuro toxicity. Nanotechnology may address a number of needs at the same time through the design of multifunctional agents able to act in the myriad of combinations of targeted and immune-therapeutical agents often needed to eradicate the existing tumors and prevent tumor growth and recurrence [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].",
            "Development and optimization of effective delivery methods (e.g. convection-enhanced drug delivery) of nanoplatforms (synthetic or natural biodegradable carriers) may significantly improve the treatment of malignant gliomas and other brain tumors in the near future. This is achieved through facilitating in vivo therapeutic targeting of tumor endothelial system and parenchymal cells, thereby permitting access to the tumor microenvironment and its component immune system. With the advent of “nano neurosurgery,” targeted and efficient molecular therapeutics and immunotherapy would soon complement the current surgical, radiological, and chemotherapeutic approaches to the management of diseases in neurooncology.",
            "This review discusses achievements of nanomedicine and immunology that could improve brain tumor treatment. Specifically, we focus on the clinical translation toward precision medicine to improve patient-specific therapeutic responses. We emphasize new biomaterials, drugs and bioengineering approaches aimed to overcome biological barriers and individual tumor heterogeneity. The classes and subclasses of nanomaterials that are currently under development or used in clinic for brain imaging and therapy are presented with evaluation of their physico-chemical properties that correspond to the clinical needs.",
            "Precision medicine, or personalized medicine, calls for the development of patient-tailored treatments based on biomarkers or stratification by mutations or biomarkers. While not yet a clinical reality, the premise of precision medicine is that it will offer superior outcomes to the traditional treatment of disease rather than a one-treatment-per-disease approach to cancer management [10]. Patient stratification has already become a standard for new drug development, because anti-cancer therapeutics often show little efficacy in unstratified studies [11].",
            "Although patient stratification is essential in the development of precision medicines, clinical trials for nanodrugs are currently conducted in unstratified populations [12]. This situation may soon change, as the importance of stratification becomes more obvious, and nanodrugs begin to gear toward specific patient populations. Nanodrugs can circumvent many current problems of delivery, which may potentially improve therapeutic efficacy of precision medicines. This may also allow more patients to receive individualized therapies.",
            "Gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors, comprising around 75% of all primary malignant brain tumors in adults [13]. Of various gliomas, glioblastoma (previously called glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM) is the most prevalent and the most lethal. The precise etiology of GBM is unknown, and the prevalence of GBMs is projected to increase in the United States as the population ages. This may be due to increases in exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental factors that induce inflammation, as well as other sources of genomic insults [14], [15], [16]. Gliomas appear to be sex-dependent, with males having around 1.6-fold higher probability of acquiring this pathology than do females. In addition, females have a better response to therapy. The exact cause of sex dependence is not clear. A recent study has found molecular differences in gliomas depending on gender and suggests the need of further research to unravel their significance and potentially modify the treatment [17]. Gliomas of low grades (I-II) have a higher survival rate, although all gliomas including high grades (III-IV) eventually result in death [18]. The conventional standard of treatment including surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy is decades old and only results in a modest survival benefit. The combination treatment using temozolomide (TMZ) with radiation therapy has led to a significant increase in patient survival rates [19]. Tumor resection is one of the primary treatment methods, though many risk factors may impact the patient’s outcome, and prevention of novel neurological deficits as a result of tumor resection is placed at a higher value than the resection itself. While majority of cases of initial recurrence are in or in the vicinity of resection in patients with GBM, late recurrences typically involve diffuse infiltrating disease distant from site of origin and not easily amenable to surgical therapy. Standard of care remains safe resection of the enhancing region of the tumor on an MRI scan or reduction in volume size at the forefront (via temozolomide) [20]. Additionally, the extent of tumor resection was found to correlate with increased patient survival at a minimum resection amount of 78% [21].",
            "Several known biomarkers, such as O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) have been identified in terms of stratifying glioma response. Reduced MGMT protein expression regulated by its promoter methylation helps prevent cellular apoptosis caused by TMZ treatment. Therefore, tumor susceptibility to TMZ treatment is increased. Additionally, IDH mutations are present in many secondary GBM tumors, and in around 10% of all gliomas [22]. As of 2021, the updated WHO CNS tumor classification separates IDH mutated GBM as different astrocytoma grade II-IV. IDH mutated GBMs are their own separate entity and are grade IV [23]. Despite advances in cancer therapy, treatment of GBM remains a significant challenge due to the paucity of curative options [24]. One major hurdle is the inability of anticancer drugs to efficiently traverse the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to reach the tumor cells. Therefore, novel drug delivery methods that can easily cross the BBB and deliver anticancer drugs to tumor cells without affecting normal cells are desired [25]. It is hoped that Nanotechnology and nanoimmunology may significantly contribute to the future treatment of gliomas by facilitating BBB traversal to allow for novel brain cancer treatments, including both direct targeting of the tumor and perhaps in combination with immunotherapy.",
            "In addition to common primary brain tumors like GBM, a more rare and similarly deadly primary brain tumor is primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Lymphomas are hematologic malignancies developing from lymphocytes. Within the four groups of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) there are over 60 specific types of tumors [26]. Lymphomas are considered as immunologically “hot” tumors, which will respond to immunotherapy. It was interesting to compare the PCNSL treatment response with other tumors, e.g., GBM, that are “cold” and do not respond easily to all kinds of immune stimulations. PCNSL represents only 4% to 6% of all extranodal lymphomas, but its incidence among immunocompetent patients is increasing, particularly among persons 65 years of age and older. This problem is getting more important nowadays with tendency to increasing longevity and geriatric population. Men are twice as likely to acquire this pathology than women [26], [27]. PCNSL is encountered in the brain, eyes, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but has no systemic manifestations, similar to the other brain primary glial tumor, GBM. About 95% of PCNSLs are diffuse large B-cell lymphomas that are typically highly infiltrative neoplasms, characterized as a “whole brain disease”, particularly at relapse. Like malignant gliomas, PCNSL is not amenable to curative resection [28], [29]. For treated lymphomas located outside the CNS, the 5-year survival is 67–79% (high-dose of methotrexate and radiation therapy or rituximab). However, treated PCNSL patients have 5-year survival rate of only 20–25% [30]. At present, there is no standard treatment for recurrent PCNSL. The median survival of patients with PCNSL did not change over the last 40 years and remains in the range of 6–7 months [31]. Lack of standard PCNSL treatment approach was confirmed in HOVON 105/ALLG NHL 24, phase III intergroup study [32], [33]. This is another primary brain tumor where combination nanotechnology and immunotherapy will likely play a critical role to help neurosurgeons and neurooncologists to treat this deadly disease.",
            "Nanotechnology is another branch focusing on development of therapeutic molecules that can combat cancer. The three main classes of nanoparticles used in CNS therapy are Lipid-based, polymeric, and inorganic nanoparticles. They have the ability to be adapted to the disease and to the patient and allow for many applications in targeting, treatment, nucleic acid and therapeutic delivery and imaging in the treatment of primary CNS tumors. These technologies will be discussed below in section 4.",
            "The BBB is composed primarily of endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes to create a selective barrier where specific molecules may pass through to the brain cells (Fig. 1\n). The tight junctions in the endothelial cells are a major reason for the limitation on the entry of molecules and ions into the brain from blood vessels. Reese and Karnovsky in 1967 described these tight junctions between the cells in the BBB vessels as continuous and only having a small number of vesicles [34], [35]. This is contrary to non-cerebral vessels where vesicles are more frequent and abundant. The sparsity of vesicles restricts the amount and kinds of materials that can pass through the BBB into the brain parenchyma [36]. The endothelial cell tight junctions are formed by the extracellular interaction of transmembrane proteins of two adjacent cells that link and bring each other’s membrane together. These transmembrane proteins are selective and determine which molecules can be paracellularly permeable to the BBB [37].Fig. 1Schematic demonstrating the normal vs tumor BBB architecture.",
            "Schematic demonstrating the normal vs tumor BBB architecture.",
            "The BBB selective permeability works primarily through the properties of its endothelial cells. Surrounding neurons, glia, astrocytes, pericytes, and circulating immune cells work together with the BBB in selective permeability, regulation of blood flow, angiogenesis, neuronal activity and development within the CNS [38]. (Fig. 1) The BBB interacts with its microenvironment in maintaining homeostasis. It works together with microglia, immune cells of the CNS, that constantly surveil the brain. They phagocytize toxic/unwanted materials as well as repair and support damaged vessels [38].",
            "Given their exposure to blood from the periphery, the main structure of the BBB are endothelial cells, which line cerebral blood vessels [38]. They restrain the fast trafficking of materials between the brain and blood to control the quantity and identities of molecules allowed in the brain. Polarized endothelial cells have different receptors on their extracellular and intracellular surface as well as various efflux and influx transporters that all together control the movement of materials [38]. They also have enzymatic barriers that inactivate and decompose various substances. This restricts certain molecules from carrying out their messages and/or performing their functions in the brain parenchyma. Endothelial cells possess a large number of mitochondria, which explains the greater use of energy for different ion gradients used for transport and enzymatic systems [38].",
            "Astrocytes are glial cells that are a major part of the neurovascular unit. They are located between blood vessels and neurons, are intimately connected to the endothelial cells, share a common basement membrane (BM) with them and play a vital role in signalling [39]. Astrocytes are the connection between the BBB and neurons, explaining why both endothelial cells and astrocytes have receptors for neurotransmitters [39]. Astrocytes relay messages from neurons to endothelial cells to initiate signal transduction pathways within the BBB and to regulate blood flow [37]. They also upregulate many of the functions of the BBB: they signal the expression of specific enzymes for the enzymatic barrier of the BBB [39], they polarize transporters to increase the transport barrier [40], and they aid in creating stronger tight junctions between endothelial cells [41], [42]. Astrocytes also function in the phenotypic makeup of the BBB. They release several molecules such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), angiopoietin 1, glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), etc. that initiate these expressions [39], [43], [44].",
            "The BBB is not just a physical barrier between the cerebral blood vessels and the brain parenchyma; it also acts as a selective barrier in which specific substances can transport to and from the CNS via active and/or passive transport. The brain endothelial cells have abundant transporters that fall into two categories: efflux and solute transporters. Efflux transporters take molecules from the brain tissue and excrete them against their concentration gradient out into blood vessels. Solute transporters bring molecules and essential nutrients down their concentration gradient, through the BBB and into the brain [37]. The cerebral endothelial cells have specific carrier-mediated transporters (CMT) for molecules that have difficulty entering the membrane of the BBB cells but are still needed for survival of the brain. Molecules can also enter the BBB via receptor-mediated endocytosis from the surface of endothelial cells [38].",
            "Gases such as oxygen passively diffuse across the BBB through a concentration gradient. In addition to gases, various lipid-soluble molecules can also enter the brain by simple diffusion; however, this depends on several factors such as their hydrogen bonding capacity, level of solubility, and molecular weight [45]. It would be convenient for drug delivery if these were the only constraints in passing through the BBB, but this is not the case. For instance, there are drugs that do not have any of these characteristics and can still enter the brain or may exhibit the same lipophilicity as some of these molecules but have a low rate of entrance into the brain [46].",
            "Due to the high electability of the BBB, it has been estimated that approximately 98% of drugs have been rejected from the BBB, and thus were ineffective in targeting specific sites of the brain tissue and for gene delivery [47], [48]. Only about 0.1% of intravenously administered therapeutic antibodies can enter the brain. To overcome this obstacle and to reach the concentration goal, higher doses of antibodies need to be administered, but this creates a greater risk of general toxicity and possibility of anaphylaxis development [49].",
            "The net charge on the surface of endothelial cells is negative, allowing cations to easier cross the BBB than anions. Endothelial cells of the BBB also contain ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which are a type of efflux pump. They hydrolyze ATP to expel toxins or unwanted molecules from the brain into the blood vessels [38].",
            "All of these transport mechanisms contribute to the overall function of the BBB in its goal of maintaining normal brain function. Without it, humans would be probably unable to survive. However, these mechanisms are also creating great difficulty in manufacturing drugs to target specific areas of the brain and help treat diseases.",
            "As the brain tumor grows, it disrupts the blood–brain barrier and triggers changes within its structures. When a primary or metastatic brain tumor grows within the brain parenchyma, it uses its surrounding environment to facilitate its own growth and survival through processes such as neoangiogenesis. As the tumor grows it creates changes in brain vasculature. These changes result in the compromised integrity of the BBB and its microenvironment, becoming an alternate form called the tumor BBB [50]. The tumor BBB is heterogeneous and usually leakier than the normal BBB. This is because the newly formed blood vessels have altered junctions and astrocytic contacts in the affected areas (sites of tumors), but at the unaffected areas (“normal” BBB) normal tight junctions are present [50], [51]. At the affected sites, cancer cells may disrupt the normal BBB so that it can facilitate their proliferation, resulting in a lack of tight junction protein expression and creation of fenestrated endothelial cells. When a tumor grows, a number of changes in tight junctions occur such as protein expression dysregulation, which leads to impaired cell–cell contact/communication [52], [53]. In the presence of a primary tumor, there is a decrease in the expression of occludin and claudins within the tight junction complex [54], [55]. This results in a discontinuous and fenestrated endothelium with small openings [51], [54]. These openings/pores are sites for passive diffusion of different manufactured drugs to target and destroy brain tumors. These changes in tight junction protein expression are seen in both primary and metastatic brain tumors. In highly metastatic brain tumors, there is a low expression in tight junction proteins, whereas for weaker metastatic brain tumors there may be an increase in tight junction expression [53]. In general, there is a negative correlation between the reduction of tight junctions and cancer metastasis development and tumor progression [53]. In human GBM, the changes from normal BBB to tumor BBB are also seen through changes in the molecular makeup of the basement membrane [52], [56].",
            "The tumor BBB has less connections and signaling with astrocytes and pericytes, altering its activity [50]. In normal brain, astrocytes secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to facilitate and manage vascular growth [50], [57], [58], [59]. In brain cancer, VEGF is used by the tumors when they run low on oxygen and need to promote neoangiogenesis to grow and survive. These new tumor blood vessels are more permeable to substances than blood vessels of the BBB [50]. In brain tumors, there is noted hyperplasia of α-SMA-expressing pericytes and overexpression of CD248 by pericytes, which is believed to aid the formation of tumor microvasculature [60]. Astrocytes also secrete a trafficking molecule called major facilitator superfamily domain (Mfsd2a), which is important for the development of normal BBB [50], [61]. In the tumor BBB, there is downregulation of Mfsd2a due to a decrease in the signaling from astrocytes to endothelial cells. This contributes to the tumor expansion in the brain and to the higher leakiness of tumor BBB [62].",
            "Although this less restrictive BBB permeability in tumors increases the flow of molecules, many drugs still have difficulty passing through tumor BBB [63]. The tumor BBB has more active efflux pumps than the normal BBB, which remove the drugs from the brain to blood vessels. Additionally, regions of the brain that are left unaffected by the tumor also have efflux pumps that expel many molecules such as drugs and prevent them from entering [64], [65], [66].",
            "Chemotherapeutic drugs can bypass the BBB by different ways including the use of iatrogenic agents or intrathecal drug administration. To allow drug passage through the BBB, it may be disrupted temporarily using osmotic means or administering vasoactive agents such as bradykinin [67], or by exposing the patient to high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) [68]. Additionally, to bypass the BBB, endogenous transporters such as glucose and amino acid carriers, receptor-mediated transcytosis using insulin or transferrin (TfR) receptors, or inhibiting efflux transporters, e.g., p-glycoprotein may be used. However, some vectors targeting BBB transporters, such as TfR, may get entrapped in brain endothelial cells, instead of being transcytosed through the BBB into the tumor [69], [70]. Preclinical and clinical methods for BBB passing also include intracerebral needle implantation and convection-enhanced drug administration. However, all the above pharmaceutical and “mechanical” mechanisms for the drug delivery through the BBB are not sufficient for efficient treatment of malignant gliomas [71].",
            "Immunotherapy of brain tumors is evolving thanks to multifunctional therapies utilizing nanotechnology. The CNS immune system is unique because it depends on the interplay of the systemic and local immune systems. Since the 1940′s the brain was thought to be “immune privileged” with the landmark paper by Medawar where skin grafts implanted into brains did not elicit rejection compared to other locations in the body [72]. Many scientists attributed this to the BBB, which was thought to create a physical and biochemical wall [73]. The BBB capillary cell tight junctions create the physical barrier, whereas astrocytic foot processes interacting with the vascular basement membrane help tightly regulate small molecule movement [74]. More recently, this paradigm has significantly shifted based on the discovery of reciprocal orchestration of BBB capillary system, different immune cell migration, differentiation and involvement of extracellular matrix. In 2012, a novel glial-lymphatic or “glymphatic” system was discovered, which clears waste from the brain via aquaporin 4 mediated mechanism and was thought to be the surrogate lymphatic drainage of the brain [75]. Only in 2015, meningeal lymphatics vessels that drain into the cervical lymph node were discovered [76].",
            "Another feature of the brain immune system is that it has resident microglial cells, which are the CNS equivalent of macrophages. The microglia’s myeloid progenitors arise from the yolk sac and form alongside the CNS where they continue to reside and replicate [77]. The microglia remain in their embryological state but get activated during inflammation, returning to quiescence after inflammation resolves. Furthermore, additional circulating monocytes are recruited in neuroinflammation on top of the brain’s resident microglia and disappear once the inflammatory process ceases [78]. Also, T cells have been noted to enter the brain under normal physiological conditions, further showing the dynamic brain immune system which was previously thought to be isolated [79]. As new discoveries are made, scientists are beginning to understand how unique and intricate the brain’s immune system is and how it connects with the rest of the human body’s immune system, which opens new doors for treatments. Nano immunology is rapidly becoming an important newest field to understand, regulate and reverse the brain tumorigeneses for treatment of the CNS pathological conditions.",
            "In the presence of a tumor, the activity of immune cells such as NK and cytotoxic T cells in the brain microenvironment becomes suppressed. Brain tumors release various effector molecules that not only decrease the functionality of immune cells, but also inhibit antitumor activity [80], [81], [82], [83]. These molecules include inflammation regulators that mediate inactivation of immune response to a tumor. Interestingly, in addition to T cell inactivation, synaptic activity to and from the glutamatergic synapses leads to tumor cell proliferation [84], [85].",
            "Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and its receptor PD-1 are proteins that normally function to aid and prevent immune cells from attacking healthy cells. In primary brain tumors, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) express PD-L1 and are thought to pass it via vesicles to regulatory cells resulting in the inhibition of CD8 + T cell activation, which is necessary for anti-tumor immunity [86]. In patients with glioma, surgical resection and immunotherapy with PD-L1 blockade results in improvement in survival rates [87], [88]. Recently, scientists were able to manufacture a B cell vaccine able to perform antigen cross-penetration for glioma, resulting in greater survival and functionality of CD8 + T cells. This vaccine, in addition to radiation therapy and PD-L1 blockage, lead to death of tumor cells as shown in approximately 80% of treated animals with tumors [89].",
            "Cancer immunotherapy has become one of the fastest developing approaches in oncology allowing successful treatment of various cancers [90], [91], [92]. The new trend in cancer treatment is a combination of immune checkpoint (CTLA and/or PD-1) inhibitors with targeted anti-cancer therapy [93]. Immunotherapy has recently been touted as the breakthrough strategy for oncology, and a wealth of data was accumulated in the last decade about therapy with checkpoint inhibitors and their side effects including systemic toxicity. These inhibitors include monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to CTLA-4 or PD-1T cell receptors, which turn off the regulatory T cells (Tregs)-mediated inhibition of anti-tumor immune response, allowing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells to eliminate cancer cells. Several humanized antibodies against immune system modulators (checkpoints) CTLA-4 and PD-1 have received FDA approval. Systemic administration of mAbs to CTLA-4 or PD-1 and to PD-L1 can suppress growth of some tumors but has low efficacy for brain tumors as these antibodies poorly cross the BBB [94], [95], [96]. Recent studies also highlighted significant roles of tumor-associated macrophages/microglia (TAMs) in cancer development and progression. TAMs produce PD-1, and its expression increases over time in mouse cancer models, and higher tumor stage in humans. PD-1 expression by TAMs was shown to suppress phagocytosis and tumor immunity [97], [98], [99]. Macrophage polarization into pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes that have distinct functional characteristics is well established. M1 anti-tumor macrophages have been used in cancer immunotherapy [100], [101]. In response to IFN-γ or TNF-α stimulation, M1 macrophages generate nitric oxide (NO) from arginine by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) to trigger anti-tumor action. M2 macrophages can be preferentially polarized by TGF-β and IL-10. Their accumulation in tumors is associated with induction of Treg cells that suppress CTLs. M2 macrophages can also suppress activation of NK cells through TGF-β. Overall, the immune reaction to tumors is mediated by the interactions among T cells (Tregs and effector cells), NK cells and TAMs [100], [101].",
            "The unique CNS immune environment and BBB physiology need to be considered for the design of glioma immunotherapy [102], [103], [104]. A recent review [94] summarized the data on the glioma immunotherapy trials. The authors analyzed the data from 28 vaccine clinical trials including peptide vaccines targeting EGFRvIII or IDH1; 13 clinical trials for oncolytic viruses; 15 clinical trials for checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., CheckMate 143 trial) and CAR-T cells, that are genetically engineered T cells with chimeric antigen receptors. It was concluded that none of these treatments have shown superior results to the GBM standard-of-care, with TMZ/radiation therapy [105]. CTLA-4 and PD-1 mAbs do not cross the BBB [104], [106], [107]; however, a modest efficacy against GBM was still observed in preclinical studies, apparently due to the general activation of the immune system upon intravenous antibody administration.",
            "To increase checkpoint inhibitor efficacy against brain tumors, BBB-crossing nanoplatforms have been engineered that would deliver inhibitors through BBB after intravenous injections to match clinical administration of therapeutic antibodies [97]. The combination of nanotechnology and immunotherapy [108] has been shown to improve delivery of nanoscale immunoconjugate drugs across the BBB in animal models. An example of such drugs is a PMLA polymer with covalently conjugated CTLA-4 or PD-1 antibodies and a BBB-crossing antibody or a peptide [6], [109]. To cross BBB, two mechanisms were used with similar results, that is, TfR-mediated transcytosis [2], [109] or a synthetic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LRP-1) ligand [110], Angiopep-2 (AP-2) peptide. Intravenous use of these nano immunoconjugate drugs resulted in the activation of local brain immune system and increased survival of intracranial GBM GL261-bearing mice. This was a pioneering use of polymeric drug carriers with attached immunotherapeutic moieties to activate brain local immune system and successfully treat GBMs upon systemic therapy. Importantly, CTL fraction including CD8 + and especially proliferating CD8 + Ki67 + T cells was significantly increased in the treated groups. Additionally, the increase of macrophages, in particular, anti-tumor M1 population was observed after treatment, along with elevation of NK cells known as “tumor killers” [6]. These data open up new avenues for modulating local brain tumor immune system using clinically standard intravenous injection of nanodrugs so that they could help orchestrate immune attack on tumor cells and shrink the tumor to aid neurosurgeons in managing gliomas with additional treatments. It should be noted that this technology could be also applied to treat brain metastasis of other tumors, such as breast or lung cancer.",
            "Despite the brain immune system’s unique adaptations and newly discovered integration with the remainder of the body’s immune system, cerebral insults are known to induce immune suppression. Chongsathidkiet et al found that in GBM and other intracranial tumors, there is systemic T cell sequestration in the bone marrow [111]\n. This mechanism appears to be elicited by depletion of surface sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) on T cells causing their internalization into bone marrow and out of circulation. When genetically stabilized to prevent internalization, the T cells remained in circulation. This alone did not confer any survival benefit but with additive stimulation of CD137(4-1BB) there was a synergistic effect and improved survival [111]. A linear correlation between tumor burden and degree of immunosuppression was described [112]. The authors postulated that a yet unknown soluble factor in circulation was responsible for these changes [112]. Additionally, other cerebral insults including stroke and trauma cause systemic immunosuppression [112]. This study also showed that once the damage is repaired, the immunosuppression resolves. Other studies found brain stromal cells secreting TGF-β and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in response to inflammation, which cause immunosuppression by counteracting inflammatory cytokines [113], [114]. These adaptative responses after cerebral insults may be triggered to prevent unrestricted inflammation and edema, thereby suppressing life-threatening increase in intracranial pressure [115]. However, tumors are also known to further cause immunosuppression via amino acid depletion mechanisms. Gliomas secrete indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) which suppresses T cell activity by depleting tryptophan [116] and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells secrete arginase, depleting arginine needed for T-cell proliferation [117]. These and possibly other yet unknown mechanisms may be one reason behind difficulties to treat primary malignant tumors of the brain. The described pathways and effectors may be valuable targets for future nanomedicines to relieve immunosuppression and help treat brain tumors.",
            "Modern immunotherapy falls into four categories: Tumor Vaccines, Oncolytic Viruses, CAR-T cells and Checkpoint Inhibitors (Fig. 2\n). In the following section, these type of treatment are discussed in more detail.Fig. 2Diagram demonstrating mechanisms of current immunotherapy for CNS tumors: CAR-T cells, tumor vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors, and oncolytic viruses.",
            "Diagram demonstrating mechanisms of current immunotherapy for CNS tumors: CAR-T cells, tumor vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors, and oncolytic viruses.",
            "Vaccines hold promise as another treatment methodology for GBM. Multiple trials are ongoing and more vaccine technologies are being developed. One such trial is PEPvIII, which is a vaccine targeting EGFRvIII mutant present in almost a third of GBM patients [118]. This vaccine showed efficacy in uncontrolled phase 2; however, it did not significantly improve survival in randomized phase 3 trials [119]. In addition, the majority of patients in EGFRvIII vaccine trials who developed recurrence had lost EGFRvIII expression [120]. Other single target vaccines include Wilms tumor 1 (WT1), IDH-R132H, and survivin. The WT1 peptide vaccine showed increased survival, but the trial was nonrandomized [121] requiring further testing. To circumvent these issues, trials were conducted with multi-peptide targeting vaccines. One such study looked at IMA950, which targets 11 GBM specific tumor peptides; however, there was no clear efficacy [122]. Other studies have tried to use personalized vaccines designed specifically to a patient’s specific tumor antigens and genetic profiling [123]. Keskin et al. observed in their phase 1/1b personalized vaccine trial that corticosteroids, which are commonly given to patients to prevent tumor-associated vasogenic edema, appear to significantly inhibit its potency via systemic T-cell responses. Patients in the trial who did not receive steroids had an increase of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8 + T cells with increase in tumor infiltrating T cells [124]. Another type of vaccine, dendritic cell (DC) vaccine, uses multiple antigens of various types to prime the immune system against tumors. The initial trail of DCs, ICT-107, where the cells were loaded with six GBM antigen peptides, suggested a survival benefit. However, there was no significant overall survival in a randomized phase II trial [125], [126]. DCVax-L, an autologous tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccine, recently completed a phase-3 clinical trial and, based on preliminary results, may increase progression-free survival. Unfortunately, the data are still limited, and it is too early to draw definitive conclusions [127].",
            "There were attempts at improving tumor vaccine efficacy. In 2004, in vitro studies showed increased immunogenicity of DC vaccines after addition of polyinosininc-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) among others [128]. These findings were corroborated in phase I/II clinical trial for glioma in 2011 where increased cytokine production and possible survival benefit [129]. Mitchell et al. used another strategy by inducing memory T cell activation with tetanus toxoid prior to CMV antigen-loaded DC vaccine treatment. This led to increased DC lymph node migration and may increase patient survival [130].",
            "Another strategy to improve tumor vaccines is to activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein [see below section 4.4], an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein, which is a critical part of STING pathway in antitumor immunity. Luo et al. used a STING activating nanoparticle vaccine (PC7A), which improved survival in multiple solid tumor mouse models as well as increased CD8 + T cells in tumors after combination therapy with radiation showing a synergistic effect [8]. It was an important demonstration that a synergistically acting combination of radiation and stimulation of STING pathway using a nanovaccine leads to a long-term regression of large mouse tumors, with a significant increase of the fraction of CD8 + T cells. These results suggest that combination of local radiotherapy with systemic PC7A nanovaccine is a promising approach to improve therapy of late-stage solid tumors. The same group further showed that their PC7A was able to stimulate prolonged production of pro-inflammatory cytokines via binding of a non-competitive surface site on STING, compared to activation with its native activator, cGMP, and an even more potent effect when both PC7A and cGMP were used. This led to significant survival increases in lung and colon tumor bearing animals. This therapy also significantly upregulated cytokine expression in cultured resected human squamous cell carcinoma, cervical tumor tissue, and sentinel lymph nodes [5]. This promising technology could also be useful for CNS tumor treatment as the STING pathway was noted to be dysfunctional in gliomas [131].

            "Oncolytic viruses are another branch of immunotherapy where viruses are modified to stimulate an immune response, cause destruction of cancer cells or deliver therapeutics into targeted cells [132]. Viruses activate the immune system through pattern recognition receptors, pathogen associated molecular patterns, and activate macrophages via toll-like receptors (TLRs) [133]. Viruses can also promote an inflamed microenvironment in tumors due to activated myeloid cells improving T cell infiltration, offering an interesting workaround for combating tumor immunosuppression often seen in GBM [94]. Oncolytic viral therapy has evolved since its conception with the initial trials using replication incompetent viruses [134] to the current employment in clinical trials of replication competent viruses such as adenoviruses, measles virus, herpes simplex virus, and polio virus among others [135], [136].",
            "One of the first viruses for GBM treatment was a recombinant oncolytic poliovirus PVSRIPO (clinical trial NCT01491893). The virus modifies the internal ribosome entry site with a human rhinovirus type 2 to prevent attack on the CNS. This therapy capitalized on the fact that GBMs often express high levels of poliovirus receptor CD155, allowing the virus to infect GBM cells. In the published studies [137], [138], overall survival plateaued at 21% of patients in the dose-expansion phase at 24 months and was sustained at 36 months, with 19% having grade 3 or higher drug related adverse event. Another early trial was a virus Toca 511, a non-lytic replicating retrovirus derived from Moloney murine leukemia virus. The virus has a modified cytosine deaminase, allowing it to preferentially infect tumor cells [139], although it also infects normal cells. The advantage of this virus is that unlike normal cells, tumor cells have impaired defense mechanisms allowing the virus to integrate into their genome more easily [140]. The trial was done in 45 patients with the virus injected into the resection cavity at the time of surgery and 6 weeks later had intravenous injection of Toca FC, an extended release 5-fluorocytosine. In infected tumor cells this prodrug was converted to its active form of 5-fluorouracil. The overall survival was 13.6 months, which was superior to matched controls. Aside from the direct tumoricidal effect, the virus also stimulated the immune system for improved response, and likely the synergy of both effects were the cause of this improved survival. Despite its initial success, the larger phase 3 trial, NCT02414165 ultimately did not show significant benefit based on data presented at the 2019 Society of Neuro-Oncology (SNO) meeting [141], [142].",
            "Adenoviruses are another class of viruses studied for oncolytic therapy for many years and have well established protocols for in vitro modifications [142]. One adenovirus, DNX2401, has been investigated in combination therapy with TMZ, pembrolizumab (NCT02798406), and IFN-γ (NCT02197169). DNX2401 targets tumor cells through a 24-base pair deletion of transforming protein E1A and insertion of an Arg-Gly-Asp motif onto a viral capsid protein, improving αv integrin targeting [143]. The company behind DNX2401 announced at the 2019 SNO meeting that their phase II trial with DNX2401 and pembrolizumab showed a median OS of 12.5 months in patients with recurrent glioma, with four patients surviving more than 23 months. They announced a phase III study being planned [144].",
            "Another aspect of oncolytic viral therapy is the ability of viruses to function as gene delivery vectors. These genes can be tumoricidal, such as those delivered by the replication-incompetent adenovirus aglatimagene besadenovec (AdV-tk). AdV-tk expresses HSV thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) which is able to convert ganciclovir into a toxic compound to kill tumor cells [145]. After being found safe in a phase I clinical trial [146], two phase II trials, BrTK02 [145] and HGG-01 [147], using AdV-tk intratumoral injection along with either valacyclovir or ganciclovir, respectively, were conducted. The trials demonstrated favorable progression-free and overall survival.",
            "Measles virus has also been used in GBM treatment. An engineered measles virus that produced carcinoembryonic antigen (MV-CEA) showed regression in flank tumors and increased survival in GBM-bearing mice [148]. This ultimately led to a clinical trial, NCT00390299; however, the trial went suspended for unknown reasons.",
            "Another group of viruses tested are Herpes simplex viruses (HSV). These viruses had great success in pre-clinical studies, especially when engineered to selectively attenuate genes, such as lacZ gene insertions into viral ribonucleotide reductase promoter, thymidine kinase deletions, among others, so that the virus targets replicating cells in the CNS [149], [150]. These preclinical studies demonstrated low toxicity and high anti-GBM effects. Multiple trials are testing different modifications of HSV.",
            "Overall, oncolytic viruses are an interesting branch of immunotherapy and seem to work synergistically with other immune therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors, which is where the future direction of research and trials are headed, such as those with DNX-2401. Many clinical trials are currently ongoing, and it may become clear soon whether these therapies provide safe and efficient treatment in clinical setting [151]. Current clinical trials using oncolytic viruses are listed in Table 1, section 2.",
            "One promising immune therapy direction is adoptive T cell therapy. The most successful development is currently chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells). CD19 targeting CAR-T cells are currently approved for treatment of B cell leukemia and lymphoma [152]. Multiple trials for GBM have been initiated, with currently 3 antigens being targeted: EGFRvIII, ERBB2 and IL-13Rα2 [153], [154], [155]. However, these therapies have a significant obstacle to overcome, which is the heterogeneity of these tumors. GBM has heterogenous cell population and therefore varying antigen expression. In the case of EGFRvIII targeting CAR-T cells, there was a significant decrease of EGFRvIII; however, wild-type EGFR was unaffected [156]. Similarly, after administration of IL-13Rα2 targeted CAR-T cells, a patient had significant regression of his tumor burden, however, soon relapsed and his tumor became IL-13Rα2 negative [155]. CAR-T cell therapy designs will have to adapt to this heterogeneity and likely broaden their effects, which increases the risk for creating a larger non-specific immune response that may affect normal tissues. One study used an EGFRvIII specific CAR-T cell and a bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) against EGFR (together, CART-BiTE), which was able to target EGFRvIII in tumors as well as recruit untransduced bystander T cells against wild-type EGFR. This caused heterogenous tumor elimination in mouse models without toxicity against human skin grafts in vivo\n[157].",
            "In addition to targeting, CAR-T cells have to deal with immunosuppressive effects. By themselves, CAR-T cells trigger an influx of Treg cells as well as immunosuppressive factor release from the brain [156]. CAR-T cell therapy design has to account for these factors to improve efficacy. Interestingly, Fraietta et al. described a patient treated with CD19 targeting CAR-T cells for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). At peak efficiency, the majority of the T cells originated from one clone that had a disruptive mutation in methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 gene [158]. This mutation greatly increased the CAR-T cell efficacy, which opens up the possibility of TET2 inhibition to further boost CAR-T cell therapy.",
            "Another related strategy to CAR-T cells is transducing cloned T cell receptors (TCRs) into T cells, expanding them, and using them for treatment. One such treatment targets pediatric diffuse pontine gliomas (DIPG). TCRs targeting DIPG mutation H3.3K27M showed efficacy in a mouse model with DIPG xenografts [159]. CAR-T cells targeting disialoganglioside GD2, a protein expressed in DIPG, also had significant tumor clearance in a mouse DIPG xenograft model [160]. This evidence holds promise for future refinement of CAR-T strategy to treat not only hematogenous malignancies but solid tumors as well including brain gliomas. Such therapy could become more efficient when combined with other treatment modalities including radiation and surgery. Current clinical trials using CAR-T cells are listed in Table 1, section 3.",
            "In recent years, immune checkpoint blockade that boosts anti-tumor immunity, particularly the inhibition of CTLA-4 and receptor-ligand system PD-1–PD-L1, has revolutionized solid tumor treatment [161], [162], [163]. However, this treatment did not show significant success for gliomas. The CheckMate-143 clinical trial compared the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab with anti-VEGFA antibody bevacizumab for recurrent GBM and found no overall survival benefit [164]. A more recent trial, CheckMate-498, dealt with MGMT unmethylated GBM using nivolumab plus radiation vs. standard therapy of radiation with TMZ and again found no improvement in overall survival [165]. The latest trial, CheckMate-548 combining TMZ with nivolumab in MGMT-methylated GBM has been stopped by Bristol-Meyer-Squibb. The company issued a press release again stating that no significant overall survival benefit was obtained, with formal results still pending [166], [167]. Although some success has been observed with checkpoint blockade for intracranial metastatic melanoma [168], GBM’s characteristics make it an elusive target. With the lack of efficacy in GBM, many groups turned to causes of checkpoint blockade failure and to novel methods of checkpoint inhibitor delivery. The significant intratumoral heterogeneity of GBM is likely one of the challenges that needs to be overcome. GBM heterogeneity has been shown on a single cell level with single cells expressing significant oncogenic transcription variations [169]. Another aspect is the dysfunction of T cells in GBM, which prevents success with checkpoint blockade [170].",
            "However, there are other immune checkpoints that may be targeted for GBM treatment. Two checkpoints under heavy investigation and ongoing clinical trials in GBM patients are T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM3) and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3). LAG3 is being tested alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 for recurrent glioma [171], and TIM3 is being tested in combination with anti-PD-1 and stereotactic radiosurgery [172]. One aspect of immune checkpoint therapy that appears to improve efficacy is neoadjuvant administration. A trial of neoadjuvant nivolumab created a powerful pro-inflammatory response and altered the GBM microenvironment, however, without a significant survival benefit [87].",
            "There is still some hope coming from a recent trial where a single dose of neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 pembrolizumab extended survival to 417 days compared to 228.5 in control arm in patients with recurrent GBM associated with a more profound immune response [88]. Another immune checkpoint, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor related protein (GITR) is expressed in Treg cells. Novel antibody checkpoint inhibitor targeting GITR receptor induces anti-tumor effects in GBM. The treatment was shown to promote CD4 Treg differentiation into CD4 effector T cells and to reduce Treg mediated suppression of immune response in tumors. These effects caused Treg cells to increase cytokine production and gain cytotoxic activity against tumor cells, while no longer causing immune suppression. Furthermore, there was a synergistic effect with PD-1 inhibitors, and the combination of GITR with PD-1 conferred significant survival benefit in GBM-bearing mice [173].",
            "Overall, traditional checkpoint blockade failed to prolong survival of GBM patients. However, new immune system targets and new inhibitor combinations are being actively tested to improve this treatment approach. Encouraging data in preclinical models on the use of checkpoint inhibitors directly delivered to glioma tissue using nanoplatforms passing through BBB are also emerging [6]. Development of this nano delivery approach may significantly increase the efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity of new generation checkpoint inhibitors and their combinations. Current clinical trials using checkpoint inhibitors are listed in Table 1, section 4.",
            "Currently, many lipid-based NPs are already approved by FDA for clinical use. Lipid-based NPs have different structures but are usually spherical platforms with at least one lipid bilayer around an aqueous compartment. For drug delivery, these NPs have considerable advantages, such as simple formulation, self-assembly, biocompatibility, good bioavailability, large payload size and a number of controllable physico-chemical properties that may be modulated and customized. Liposomes that also belong to lipid-based NPs are typically composed of phospholipids, with unilamellar and multilamellar vesicular structures. This feature allows the liposomes to carry various drugs (hydrophilic, hydrophobic and lipophilic). Hydrophilic and lipophilic agents can be entrapped in one liposome, thereby expanding the use of this class of NPs. Another variant of lipid-based NPs is commonly called lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). They are similar in structure to liposomes and frequently utilized for nucleic acids delivery [174] (Fig. 3\n,\nTable 2\n).Fig. 3Schematic showing the categories of nanoparticles used for CNS tumor treatment, with uses in diagnostic imaging and therapy.Table 2Selected nanoparticles and its subclasses used in CNS translational study.Class of nanoparticlesApplicationsConcernsI.

            "Polymeric NPs are produced from natural or synthetic materials and have a number of variable structures and characteristics (Fig. 3\n,\nTable 2). Their synthesis can enable precise control of various features. They constitute good delivery systems because of their biocompatibility, simple formulation and variable drug delivery abilities. Drugs can be encapsulated in the NP core, or trapped in the polymer matrix, or covalently bound either to the polymer or to the NP surface. Polymeric NPs can deliver various hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs of different size, including small molecules, macromolecules, proteins and vaccines [175], [176], [177], [178], [179], [180]\n, making them very suitable for co-delivery [181].",
            "The most common polymeric NPs are nanocapsules that have cavities surrounded by a polymeric membrane or shell and nanospheres that have solid matrix. Polymeric micelles that are also block copolymers can self-assemble to nanospheres with a hydrophilic inner core and a hydrophobic outer coating. This structure protects aqueous cargo and helps improve circulation time. Polymeric micelles have been used as delivery vehicles for cancer drugs in clinical trials [182].",
            "Dendrimers consist of hyperbranched polymers with complex architecture allowing for the mass, size, shape and surface modifications to be well controlled. Active groups on the dendrimer exterior enable chemical conjugation of biological or contrast agents to the surface whereas drugs can reside in the interior. Dendrimers can carry various drugs, most commonly nucleic acids and small molecules [183], [184]. For these applications, charged dendrimers including poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) and poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) are utilized. Dendrimer-based compounds are currently in clinical trials testing them as theranostic, contrast and transfection agents, as well as topical gels [184], [185], [186]. Generally, polymeric NPs are great candidates for drug delivery because of their superior features including biodegradability, water solubility, biocompatibility, and stability during storage. The possibility of easy modification for targeting [187] allows polymeric NPs to deliver proteins, chemical agents, and genetic material to specific tissues, making them attractive systems for cancer diagnostics, treatment, and gene therapy. However, polymeric NPs possess an increased risk of particle aggregation and toxicity, which is a known drawback for their use. For this reason, only a few polymeric nanomedicines are FDA-approved, and these nanocarriers are currently being evaluated in clinical trials [188].",
            "Gold, iron and silica have been used to produce nanostructured materials for drug delivery and imaging (Fig. 3). Inorganic NPs can be precisely formulated and engineered to have various sizes and structures. Gold NPs (AuNPs) exist in various forms including nanospheres, nanoshells, nanorods, nanostars, and nanocages [189]. Inorganic NPs possess unique properties including physical, magnetic, electrical, and optical. For instance, AuNPs have free electrons at their surface that continually oscillate at a frequency dependent on their size and shape, conveying them photothermal properties [190]. Also, AuNPs can be easily functionalized to expand their properties and delivery abilities [189].",
            "Iron oxide is also a popular material for inorganic NPs; most FDA-approved inorganic nanomedicines belong to this category [191] (Table 2). Magnetic iron oxide NPs composed of magnetite (Fe3O4) or maghemite (Fe2O3) is superparamagnetic at certain sizes and is a valuable contrast agent, drug delivery system and thermal-based therapeutic [192]. Other inorganic NPs made of calcium phosphate and mesoporous silica have been also successfully used for gene and drug delivery [193], [194]. Semiconducting quantum dots made of silicon are unique NPs used for in vitro imaging applications and are also promising for in vivo diagnostics [195], [196].",
            "Inorganic NPs have special magnetic, radioactive or plasmonic properties and are uniquely suitable for diagnostics, imaging and photothermal therapy. They usually possess good biocompatibility and stability and are being used in applications requiring properties that organic materials do not have. Their disadvantages limiting clinical applications include low solubility and some toxicity, especially when heavy metals are used [192], [197].",
            "Recently, gliomas have been well characterized by genomic and molecular marker analysis under The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project [128], [222], [223]. These studies have highlighted GBM heterogeneity and the necessity for the development of new treatment strategies. Such strategies not only target cancer cells but are also directed to critical components of brain tumor microenvironment that facilitate malignant growth, invasion and escape from immune surveillance [224]. They are also part of the niche for cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are thought to be responsible for tumor therapy resistance and recurrence development [224], [225], [226]. Tumor blood vessels are key part of this niche in gliomas and provide structural and functional support to perivascular CSCs [225], [226], [227], [228], [229]. The available evidence emphasizes the importance of tumor extracellular matrix (ECM), vascular system, immune environment in GBM growth and recurrence, and suggests that new therapies could target this niche in addition to cancer cells for inhibiting glioma growth and CSCs [224], [226], [230]. Recent preclinical evidence showed the ability of nanoformulations to successfully modulate GBM microenvironment including ECM [7] and brain local immune system [6] to inhibit GBM growth. This gives hope for the development of clinically relevant combinations of nanodrugs targeting both cancer cells and tumor microenvironment in a multiprong effort to increase glioma treatment efficacy while maintaining safety due to direct nanodrug delivery to the tumors.",
            "Targetable molecular glioma markers that are used in preclinical and clinical studies include EGFR, tenascin-C, bcl-2 family of antiapoptotic proteins, survivin, Rho proteins, p53, MMPs, VEGF and its receptors [231], [232], [233]. Increased expression of some proteins (EGFR, tenascin-C, survivin, laminins) is associated with poor survival of patients [7], [234], [235], [236], [237]. Some drugs aimed at modulating the expression levels of such markers are being used in clinic; however, there are no clinically approved nanodrugs in this class. Nonetheless, preclinical studies are constantly expanding to develop nanoplatforms able to pass through BBB and change the expression of glioma markers in the desirable direction. For instance, our group has found that vascular BM protein laminin-411 (α4β1γ1) was overexpressed in 92% of GBM cases, and this correlated with shorter time to glioma recurrence and poor survival. It was proposed as a marker for prediction of recurrences and patient survival, based on the analysis of several hundred GBM samples [7], [238]. Laminins are major BM components important for cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis, as well as for the maintenance of the BBB [239], [240]. Dysregulation of cell-laminin interactions is found in various cancers. In GBMs, this dysregulation is associated with increased Notch signaling and high expression of CSC markers [7]. In several mouse models of intracranial GBM, selective inhibition of laminin-411 by specific antisense attached to PMLA-based nanoconjugate reduced Notch signaling and the expression of CSC markers with significant increase of survival in tumor-bearing animals. Suppression of GBM growth and survival increase were similar in animals treated with nanoconjugate and untreated animals that were inoculated with GBM cells where laminin-411 expression was blocked by CRISPR-Cas9 [7]. These data attested to the high efficacy of the used nanoconjugate able to pass through BBB and block a GBM protein laminin-411. These studies illustrate the high potential of nanotechnology for developing new pharmacological therapies against gliomas that could be used alone or in combination with other treatment modalities.",
            "The BBB is a complex barrier structure formed by tight-junction connected brain capillary endothelial cells surrounded by pericytes and astrocytes—all three contributing significantly to the integrity of this structure. BBB also protects the brain from various harmful agents including pathogens. It is important to fully understand the functions and components of the BBB to create the most effective drugs that can be delivered to specific targets in the brain and overcome the obstacles posed by the BBB. The BBB controls which molecules can enter/exit the brain as well as maintain a homeostatic environment. It acts as a highly selective barrier between the cerebral blood vessels and the brain parenchyma. The BBB maintenance of homeostasis allows CNS structures to perform their functions properly without facing any interruptions from other processes carried throughout the body, and to maintain normal brain function as a highly specialized neurovascular unit [241]. The BBB permits passing oxygen and other necessary nutrients needed for survival into brain cells, but rejecting harmful and/or unknown molecules from entering.",
            "Nanodrug delivery approaches including specific delivery to the brain represent a significant portion of biopharma research and offer many promising applications. Current developments are aimed to improve controlled drug release, target cell-specific drug release and efficacy, and reduction of systemic side effects [9], [242], [243].",
            "A significant advantage of nano drug delivery vehicles is their ability to pass through biological barriers, especially important for the CNS and gastrointestinal tract [244], [245], [246], [247]. Growing tumors release angiogenic factors and build new vasculature inside them with often abnormal extracellular matrix. Brain tumor vessels unlike normal ones that characteristically have tight junctions forming the BBB, may have 600 to 800 nm gaps between adjacent endothelial cells. Such abnormal vessels may not completely preclude passage of macromolecular drug carriers through the BBB into the brain parenchyma. Such nonspecific, “passive” targeting was described by Maeda as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [248]. Because of altered tumor lymphatic drainage, EPR effect allows macromolecular drugs to reach high tumor drug concentrations (10-fold or higher) compared with free drug administered at r the same dose [249]. However, EPR effect seems to be less important in case of poorly vascularized tumors or necrotic tumors with little angiogenesis. Many drugs including antibodies are still unable to enter the brain tumors even with morphological and physiological changes of the tumor vasculature allowing passive EPR effect-mediated passage. For this reason, new drug delivery systems have specific moieties targeting brain endothelial cell surface proteins that enables them to pass through BBB by transcytosis and reach tumor cells. This process is called “active” or ligand-mediated targeting. Some of these promising medicines are being used in clinic (Ambisome, Doxil, DepuCyt, Bexxar), with active development of many others [250].",
            "Nanotechnology for the generation of drug delivery devices requires a platform that is able to carry multiple components, such as a drug, a targeting agent, and a tracking agent, as well as allow for controlled and target-specific drug release and have a good safety profile [250]. Additional moieties may be needed for drug delivery through BBB and blood–brain tumor barrier that exists in brain tumors.",
            "Polymers able to deliver drugs to tumor cells rather than to the whole brain are gaining momentum partly due to lower immunogenicity than viral vectors that renders them more useful for multiple treatments [251], [252], [253], [254]. The advantages of macromolecular therapeutics compared to low molecular mass drugs also include increased efficacy and maximum tolerated dose, lower non-specific toxicity and activity toward multidrug resistant cells, increased solubility and tumor targetability, enhanced accumulation in solid tumors, induction of tumor cell apoptosis, and activation of different signaling pathways. These therapeutics are exemplified by the extensively characterized system to treat GBMs that is based on a natural polymer, poly(b-L-malic) acid (PMLA). The beneficial properties of PMLA as a carrier platform for modern drugs are its high loading capacity, lack of toxicity and immunogenicity, biodegradability, stability in the bloodstream (avoiding long term storage), and ready cellular uptake [255], [256], [257], [258], [259].",
            "Nanotherapy is a mechanism that has been proven successful in targeting brain tumors. Nanodrugs can not only cross the BBB, which is one of the greatest obstacles that drugs have to overcome to be considered effective, but they can also activate anti-tumor immune responses in the brain when loaded with therapeutic antibodies. This is engineered using covalently bound antibodies on the nanoplatform such as PMLA or others as part of the delivery system crossing BBB. Activation of the anti-tumor immune response results in an increase in immune cells (NK cells, CD8 + T cells, macrophages) in the microenvironment of gliomas [6]. Therapy with these nanodrugs greatly increased animal survival and treatment efficacy of primary brain tumors compared to treatments with free immune response-stimulating antibodies, such as anti-CTLA-4 anti-PD-1 [6]. Such nanodrugs cross the BBB via receptor-mediated transcytosis and then can be released into the brain parenchyma [260], [261], [262]. This process of BBB crossing may be achieved through various ligands on the nanodrugs, e.g., MiniAp-4 (M4), Angiopep-2 (AP2), transferrin and insulin receptor ligands, glucose transporters, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, etc.[4], [263]. One complication of receptor mediated transcytosis across the BBB is the heterogeneous composition of various receptors [264].",
            "Even though nanodrugs are able to cross the BBB, they may fail in entering the brain parenchyma due to a non-specific binding to the extracellular matrix [265], [266]. To overcome this challenge, scientists have explored changing the surface of the nanodrugs, such as creating a dense PEG coating. This modification greatly improved delivery because the nanodrugs are more evenly distributed throughout the brain and can better penetrate GBMs [265], [266], [267]. It should be noted, however, that despite these advances and emerging clinical trials, the BBB still remains a major challenge for drug delivery and efficient targeting of tumors even for newer nanoformulations.",
            "To avoid the BBB overall, scientists have explored another possible route, which is to administer drugs intranasally to the brain [268], [269]. This circumvents the limitations posed by the BBB and systemic delivery. However, like any other option, this method has its problems too. Administering drugs intranasally can only be done in a limited dosing volume, whereas congestion and mucus become an additional obstacle for a drug to overcome [270], [271].",
            "Angiogenesis is the process of new blood vessel formation from pre-existing vasculature. Angiogenesis is triggered by angiogenic growth factors and their receptors in concert with ECM and its integrin receptors. ECM can activate intracellular signaling pathways mediating endothelial cell survival, proliferation, migration, morphogenesis, and blood vessel organization [272]. ECM and growth factor receptors can potentiate each other’s effects. For instance, activated αvβ3 integrin promotes phosphorylation and activation of VEGF receptor [(VEGFR)-2], augmenting VEGF mitogenic activity [252]. Gliomas are highly vascularized tumors and are known to promote angiogenesis during their growth [273]. This property makes these tumors attractive targets for antiangiogenic therapy. This is why the angiogenic growth factors and vascular ECM, as well as technologies for inhibiting them are important for further development of brain tumor treatments.",
            "Because angiogenesis is an integral part of tumor development, angiogenic biomarkers are considered important for cancer treatment. In the last two decades, antiangiogenic therapy emerged as one of the winners among FDA-approved biological drugs: Avastin (Genentech), Sorafenib (Nexavar, Onix Pharmaceuticals), Sunitinib (Sutent, Pfizer). Antiangiogenic therapy alone or most often in combination with other drugs significantly increases the cancer patient’s longevity and quality of life [274], [275], [276], [277]. Engineering a novel antiangiogenic drug with precise tumor delivery by using peptides or pegylated polymers is thus considered a high priority [251], [278], [279], [280]. In 2009, FDA granted accelerated approval to bevacizumab (anti-VEGF mAb) for glioma treatment. VEGF is arguably the best studied angiogenic growth factor that mediates the formation of new blood vessels under both physiologic and pathologic conditions. However significant side effects seen with bevacizumab are hypertension, proteinuria including nephrotic syndrome, venous and arterial thrombosis including cerebral and myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attacks, bleeding and hemorrhage, impaired wound healing, and congestive heart failure [281]. For these reasons, the use of this therapy requires close patient monitoring and caution, and imposes constraints on dosage. It may be assumed that targeted delivery of bevacizumab to brain tumors using nanosystems could significantly alleviate systemic toxicity and would allow increasing the dose for a maximum anti-tumor effect.",
            "To target tumor vasculature, several polymeric nanoplatforms have been proposed. PMLA-based polymers delivering laminin-411 inhibitors to GBM have been described above [6], [7]. Another promising nanopolymeric drug based on a synthetic polymer, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide [282], conjugated with O-(chloracetyl-carbamoyl) fumagillol (TNP-470) has also been extensively used in preclinical studies including inhibition of GBM growth [283], [284]. Polymers that deliver drugs to tumors are poorly immunogenic and suitable for multiple treatment, which may be necessary to eradicate the tumor [283], [285].",
            "One of the difficult-to-treat brain tumors is primary CNS lymphoma (PSNSL) belonging to the group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). This group comprises heterogeneous diseases 85–90% of which originate from B lymphatic cells where CD20 receptor is overexpressed [286]. Anti-CD20 mAb rituximab (RTX) has revolutionized the therapeutic landscape for B-cell malignancy [287]. Among the RTX mechanisms of action, direct induction of apoptosis remains far from being fully exploited. Hyper-crosslinking of CD20 induces apoptosis, but the ligation of CD20 by RTX itself is very limited [288].",
            "To improve the efficacy of anti-CD20 approach in NHL, Kopeček’s group designed nanopolymeric drugs for lymphoma treatment. His approach was based on crosslinking of CD20 antigens. The used nanoconjugates for direct and enhanced induction of apoptosis in NHL cells used drug-free macromolecular therapeutics (DFMT). One design was a composition of multiple anti-CD20 antibody Fab’ fragments attached to N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer [289], [290]. In another design, receptor crosslinking was mediated by the biorecognition of binding motifs (coiled-coil peptides, or complementary oligonucleotides) at the cell surface [291], [292], [293], [294], [295], [296], [297], [298], [299], [300], [301], [302], [303], [304], [305], [306], [307]. Crosslinking of CD20 initiates apoptosis by calcium influx and mitochondrial signaling pathway without the involvement of toxins or cytotoxic drugs [305], [307]. The DFMT was effective in vitro\n[291], [292], [293], [295], [296], [297], [298], [299], [300], [301], [302], [303], [305], [307], in vivo\n[294], [296], [301], and on cells isolated from patients diagnosed with various subtypes of B cell malignancies [300], [301], [304]. DFMT induced apoptosis in 65.9% cells from patients irrespective of genomic aberrations (13q14; 17p13; and 11q22 deletions) [304]. Kopeček’s team also elucidated the ability of DFMT to treat rituximab-resistant NHLs by: a) upregulating CD20 receptors by gemcitabine pretreatment, and b) covalent conjugation of anthracyclines or other agents to the DFMT. The latter can integrate the advantages of both chemosensitization function and improved intracellular drug delivery into a single system, resulting in maximum effect of chemotherapy and receptor-mediated apoptosis [306]. This interesting concept could be used in design of nanoconjugates for the treatment of PCNSL using a delivery vehicle that will mediate the transcytosis of the nanoconjugates through the BBB. The incorporation of special moieties for transcytosis across the BBB is imperative since intravenous RTX alone is not effective [308].",
            "The other elegant system published by Gao’s group describes the nano immune approach by using synthetic polymeric nanoparticle, PC7A NP, based on monomer 2-(hexamethyleneimino) ethyl methacrylate (C7A-MA) to modulate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway in antitumor immunity [5], [8]. These data show promise for the future use of nanoformulations able to pass through the BBB to stimulate local immune response for a more efficient treatment of brain tumor of various etiologies.",
            "RNA therapy is a relatively new mechanism in nanomedicine (using mRNA, siRNA, miRNA) that has gained popularity in recent years. Compared to the delivery of plasmid DNA, RNA therapeutics do not need to enter the cell's nucleus, and do not run the risk of insertional mutagenesis [309].",
            "In order for mRNA to be delivered properly and effectively into the targeted site, it must have a vehicle of delivery that not only protects mRNA from the natural degradation by endonucleases, but also has specificity to send it to its destined location [310], [311]. To target brain tumors, it must be able to also cross the BBB. Currently, about 70% of clinical trials with RNA delivery use recombinant viruses as the delivery vehicles [312]. This is because new generation recombinant viruses have a high cell transduction rate, don’t affect the products of the mRNA translation, and present virtually no oncogenic and minimal immunogenic potential. They do however have a limited capacity of nucleic acids in which they can carry [313]. When the mRNA is being delivered, there must be a sufficient intracellular arrangement of the nucleic acids so that the translation can occur, all the while preventing the activation of the body’s immune response [310], [311].",
            "Non-viral vectors are another vehicle system that can be used in gene delivery. They have clear advantages as a delivery mechanism because they are safe and easy to be produced. The amount of nucleic acids they can potentially carry is not a major obstacle, and they are economically and reproducibly more advantageous than viral vectors. Although there are still issues with cell transfection efficiency, methods have been developed that have improved this part of their use [314], [315], [316].",
            "It is very important to have the most effective and efficient vehicle for the delivery of mRNA. Selection of the right vehicle would prevent the major complications [317]. Direct intravenous delivery of mRNA (with no vehicle) by microinjections into the body has been tested [318], [319]. This is an ineffective method since mRNA is degraded by ribonucleases and the body’s immune response is activated. The half-life of the naked mRNA once intravenously delivered is less than 5 min [320].",
            "Through extensive research of nucleic acids and materials science, it has been suggested that a universal delivery system is not probable [321]. It should be designed and catered to the specific disease and target. Such vehicles can vary in physicochemical characteristics, shape, size and ionization potential in order to most efficiently carry the naked mRNA to the designated target. These delivery systems can also be designed to initiate different bodily responses such as a reduction of toxicity to healthy tissues, an increase in blood circulation, etc. [310], [322]. These factors are important to consider when targeting brain tumors and protecting the healthy cells surrounding the lesion.",
            "Lipid-based vectors are the most commonly used non-viral vehicles for naked mRNA delivery [323]. Due to the hydrophobic nature of the lipid bilayer of the BBB endothelial cells, this allows for the passive diffusion of highly lipophilic substances to pass through [324], [325]. Nanoparticles are modified to have lipid-based vectors in order to enter through the BBB and target tumors [324]. Unfortunately, a highly hydrophobic nanoparticle is not the most effective in passing through the BBB; these types of nanoparticles tend to be retained in the lipid bilayer and not permeate through [324], [326]. This can result in cellular toxicity through the excretion or uptake by the cell transporters [324]. Thus, it is important to construct a nanodrug that is the perfect balance between being lipophilic and hydrophilic, so that it can effectively cross the BBB and target brain tumors [327].",
            "The major component of these lipid-based vectors are cationic lipids, which form electrostatic bonds with mRNA [323]. Cationic lipids can also be designed to form lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as well as cationic nanoemulsions (CNEs) [314]. CNEs are mainly used to create mRNA vaccines, and have a droplet size distribution of 200 nm [328], [329]. LNPs are currently one of the most advanced systems for mRNA delivery [330]. FDA-approved drugs contain an ionizable lipid, Dlin-MC3-DMA (MC3), which is used as a vehicle for mRNA delivery [331], [332]. In order to have the maximum mRNA release into the targeted site, the delivery system must have more phospholipid and polyethylene glycol (PEG) than cholesterol and ionizable lipids [333]. LNPs are typically composed of ionizable lipids with other helper lipids that aid in maintaining vehicle structure and facilitate endocytosis, cholesterol that also helps stabilize the vehicle structure, and PEG lipids [334], [335], [336]. The use of LNPs as a delivery mechanism for mRNAs has been increasingly used to treat cancer since its first study in 1999 [337]. LNP mRNA vaccines contain tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). An immune response is initiated by these vaccines once the antigen is expressed in the antigen-presenting cells (APCs or macrophages) [338]. The most common procedure used for mRNA vaccination in cancer is ex vivo therapy with transfected DCs (strongest APC of the immune system) [339].",
            "The very first trials with mRNA delivery as a form of cancer immunotherapy showed that direct injections of naked mRNA resulted in rapid degradation, which emphasizes the importance of a delivery system [340]. Today, lipids are the most commonly used system which are then followed by polypeptides. Vaccines with mRNA encoding antigens are developed in the lipid nanosystems [309]. Current clinical trials are designed to treat GBM with mRNA delivery and find the most successful sequence and mechanism of delivery. Some of these trials include mRNA encoding Survivin and hTERT, vaccines with TAA mRNA, and mRNA encoding WT1. Some trials also include the intravenous therapy of mRNA CAR-T cells for treatment [309].",
            "During the COVID-19 era the importance of mRNA delivery technologies was demonstrated with the development of mRNA vaccines saving millions of lives. Some of these successful formulations are LNP-mRNA vaccines. Although they are used against a specific viral pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), they are important for brain field as they may protect brain cells from the viral assault as discussed below. The COVID-19 disease and vaccines against it are also important for the brain tumor field as more and more patients with brain cancer present with viral infection that could potentially alter the course of malignant disease and of its surgical and therapeutic management.",
            "Respiratory infections from viral pathogens (e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 disease) result in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide and seriously affect endothelial system including the brain vasculature as a high vascular density [341].",
            "Clinical trials by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna using mRNA nano vaccines showed significant protection against hospitalization from COVID-19 in 94% of vaccinated people. The protection was lower against newer SARS-CoV-2 mutated variants but still remained high. Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by the European Medicines Agency use LNPs as delivery vehicles for mRNA. Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) has recently received full FDA approval. In both vaccines, viral Spike protein mRNA chain contains modified nucleoside 1-methyl-pseudouridines instead of uridine, to increase protection against RNAse degradation. The construct is able to express full-length Spike glycoprotein. Two proline additions are served to fix S1-S2 Spike protein subunits in a pre-fusion conformation. The ionizable cationic LNP carriers have pKa values between 6 and 7, and contain cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), and a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-conjugated lipid, which prevents LNP aggregation during storage. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna formulations have different PEG terminal groups and different lipid conjugated to PEG. The quantity of vaccine per Pfizer-BioNTech dose is 30 μg, compared to Moderna’s 100 μg [220], [342].",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has created a global need for not only treating infected patients but to also rapidly develop new approaches on how to take care of immune deficient categories of patients suffering from cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, as well as of aged population and several other categories. It has been shown that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has high affinity for human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [343], [344]. ACE2 is the main entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and is expressed on the surface of various human cells, such as lung, heart, kidney, neurons, and endothelial cells.",
            "There are a number of data that have not been systemically sorted out yet, which show how the CNS is affected in COVID-19 patients, how the virus may be entering the brain and the role of inflammation, systemic and local brain immune systems and impaired BBB for progression of brain tumors and cancer patient’s survival.",
            "COVID-19 patients usually show an altered inflammatory response with the immune system overactivation [345], [346]. Cytokine storm, which may develop during severe infection, increases endothelial cell permeability and promotes pathophysiological changes in the brain. The endothelial injury may result more from host inflammatory responses because of epithelium infection than from viral replication or increased viral load in endothelial cells. Summarizing these results, Barbosa et al. indicated that direct or indirect activation of endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to pulmonary edema and may trigger a coagulation cascade seen in severe COVID-19 with further damage of multiple organs [347].",
            "Patients with severe COVID-19 have decreased interferon (IFN) production, as well as aberrant polarization of Th cells (predominantly Th17), increased expression of exhaustion-related surface markers, such as TIM3 and PD-1, and altered cytokine secretion pattern [348], [349], [350]. Pulmonary epithelial cells may act as a gateway for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but alveolar problems may be mediated mainly by endothelial damage, resulting in cytokine and chemokine activation and immune system cell recruitment [350]. SARS-CoV-2 infection may thus not be the primary cause of tissue damage in COVID-19 [351], [352]. COVID-19 has been associated with the significant recruitment of immune cells directly affecting endothelial cells. The tissue damage may result from the excessive immune response causing acute inflammation mediated by massive release of cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) [351]. These cytokines affect lung parenchyma, oxygen uptake and endothelial cells, leading to endotheliitis, thrombotic events and intravascular coagulation [353].",
            "Clinical evidence points to the frequent impact of the central nervous system (CNS) by SARS-CoV-2 infection, either direct or indirect, although the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. One such mechanism may involve pericytes that are contractile perivascular cells in tissues including the brain that have been proposed as SARS-CoV-2 infection points. Wang et al. have shown that pericyte-like cells (PLCs), when integrated into a cortical organoid, are capable of being infected with original SARS-CoV-2 [354]. They developed an experimental model for studying neural infection, PLC-containing cortical organoids, which served as viral 'replication hubs', and tracking virus spreading to astrocytes and mediating inflammatory type I IFN transcriptional responses.",
            "Based on brain ACE2 expression data, it was reported [355], [356], [357] that in rodents and humans ACE2 is expressed in the brain gate entry as oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, and directly in brain tissues as the substantia nigra, choroid plexus, non-neuronal cells and many neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory. Brain ACE2 could contribute to the neurological symptoms in COVID-19 [358] including neurogenic hypertension [359]. The damage reported in the oral and nasal mucosal epithelium may also be a result of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE2 and/or other receptors [358], [360], [361], [362], [363].The presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles in brain neurons of infected patients has also been documented.",
            "All these observations suggest a mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain that might underlie neurovascular and vascular symptoms clinically seen in some COVID-19 patients [347]. The epithelial/endothelial lesions mediated by cytokines/chemokines could potentially damage the BBB, promoting vascular permeability, leukocyte and macrophage infiltration, and hypoxia [348].",
            "Loss of smell is a frequent symptom in COVID-19, with yet unknown etiology. Cell types in the olfactory cells that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules have been identified [364]. Molecular sequencing has shown that olfactory mucosa in several species including human expresses two key genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, that is, ACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Single cell sequencing supported by immunostaining showed ACE2 expression in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells, as well as in dorsally-located olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and olfactory bulb pericytes in the mouse. It has been suggested that anosmia and other problems with odor perception in COVID-19 patients may be due to SARS-CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types.",
            "In samples from the patients who died from COVID-19, brain hyperemic and edematous tissue and degenerated neurons have been found [365]. Neurological analyses of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, found neurologic manifestations, such as stroke or cerebral hemorrhage, in 36% of SARS-CoV-2 patients treated for severe infection [365]. These cerebrovascular manifestations may be due to the BBB and brain vasculature impairment [366]. Changes in the BBB may lead to alternative functions of tight junctions, which prevent free passage through the vessel wall, and expression of transporters regulating the entry and exit of various substrates. Tight junctions also limit transcellular transport through the capillary wall that maintains low levels of leukocyte adhesion molecules expression limiting the entry of immune cells into the brain [367], [368], [369], [370].",
            "Neurotropic respiratory viruses appear to enter the CNS via the two main pathways, that is, hematogenous and neuronal [371]. Currently, the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 achieves neuroinvasion is still unclear. It was postulated that this occurs through olfactory nerve trans-synaptic transfer, with vascular endothelium infection or immune cells migration through the potentially compromised BBB [354]. The expression of ACE2 was found in the brain tissue capillaries and cultured primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells [372], in line with detection of virus-like particles in the frontal lobe endothelium [373].",
            "Brain vascular endothelial cells highly express SARS-CoV-2 entry-associated protease cathepsin B (CTSB) but not TMPRSS2 [355], [366]. Viral invasion of the CNS could lead to the release of viral proteins that affect the structure and function of endothelial cells, degrade tight junction proteins, and lead to BBB permeability [366], [374].",
            "In the era of COVID-19, the total coronavirus cases in the world are over 214 million, with 4.47 million deaths as of August 25, 2021 [375]. Based on these figures, the neurosurgical and neurooncological management of brain tumor patients should be quickly adapted to the future needs of COVID-19 affected cancer patients. Neovascularization is a major characteristic of brain cancer. The patient’s risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be associated with overexpression of ACE2 on endothelial cells and altered immunity. Also, both cancer therapeutics and tumor microenvironment can cause immunosuppression and vascular complications, with modulation of ACE2 levels in cancer patients [347]. Cancer cells with altered immunogenicity may cause immune cells to produce immunosuppressive effectors, such as TGF-β, VEGF, PGE2, IL-10, and iNOS, inhibiting the proliferation and the cytotoxic response from T lymphocytes and leading to a prevalence of anti-inflammatory phenotype (T regs, M2 macrophages). Immunosuppressive microenvironment can induce the recruitment/polarization of anti-inflammatory M2 TAMs and immature dendritic cells [376]. However, COVID-19 and cancer patients may also develop altered immune and inflammatory reactions with high expression of IL-2 and IL-6 receptors, and possible changes in the prothrombotic state, such as elevation of prothrombin time [377], [378], [379], [380]. This may negatively affect the course of disease.

            "Chronic immunosuppression in tumor patients could facilitate the infection by SARS-CoV-2 and increase COVID-19 severity. However, very little is known about ACE2 and other virus entry receptor levels on endothelial cells in brain cancer patients. ACE2 is a regulator of tumor angiogenesis [381], and this receptor has abnormally high expression in lung tumors [382]. Additionally, higher levels of VEGF were found in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls [383]. Based on these limited data, Barbosa et al. hypothesized that the level of ACE2 in the vascular endothelium of cancer patients may influence the risk associated with COVID-19 [347].",
            "It was recently published that cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a high chance of serious disease, a high risk of mortality, and a worse prognosis [378], [379], [381], [384], [385], [386]. It was reported that cancer patients had a higher risk of serious COVID-19 than patients without cancer (39% vs. 8%, P = 0.0003) [377]. Lung tumors were the most common form (28%). Clinical outcomes of patients with hematological malignancies were also worsened, with 2-fold increased mortality compared with patients with solid tumors (50% vs. 26.1%) [378]. However, available statistical data are not sufficient to conclude whether cancer is an independent risk factor, or the observed differences would mainly be due to gender, age, obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and/or therapy, in particular for brain tumors [387], [388]. All the above should alert the physicians when treating cancer patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus (Fig. 5\n).Fig. 5Main neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and proposed mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion.

In addition, the action of the chemotherapeutic anti-VEGF bevacizumab in SARS-CoV-2 patients is currently being evaluated in a clinical trial (NCT04275414) [383]. However, many chemotherapeutics including antiangiogenic drugs inhibiting VEGF are also associated with systemic cardiovascular toxicity. Hypertension, thrombosis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmias all increase cardiovascular risk in cancer patients [390], [391]. Moreover, these examples indicate that invasive surgical, radiological and pharmaceutical management should be adapted to the new situation that affects millions of people with extra caution in cancer patients compromised by COVID-19.",
            "The comprehensive analyses of primary brain tumor biology demonstrates that discovery of tumor specific targets, immunotherapy with optimal BBB delivery systems together with effective combination therapy are the main directions to win the battle against poorly treatable brain tumors. Nanomedicine treatment approaches open new horizons for creation of multifunctional drugs and novel nano immunotherapies. The expected goals for the neurosurgery and neuro oncology would be to translate innovation in nanotechnology and its novel opportunities to the clinical arena. Through continued mutual effort of multidisciplinary scientists, physicians, chemists, pharmacologists, molecular biologists, immunologists, and engineers, the future of nanomedicine and nano neurosurgery will be shaped towards clinical benefits. To fulfill the need for new effective nanomedicines combating brain cancer, the neurosurgery and neuro oncology also need newer preclinical models with personalized approach. The development of these models using patient-derived tumors has already allowed to successfully test some nanodrug treatments for GBM [7]. Recently developed new animal models utilize molecularly characterized cancer cells bearing the same oncogene mutations that are found in individual patients with gliomas [392], [393]\n. They may constitute next generation of testing systems for the emerging nanomedicines aimed at helping neurosurgery to successfully fight deadly gliomas.",
            "To curb the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO calls for 50–80% of the world population to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 virus, where mRNA nanoparticles are currently playing the dominant role. Given the intrinsic relationship between endothelial system including the brain endothelium and the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, endothelial-related therapies such as anticoagulants, fibrinolytic drugs, immunomodulators, and molecular therapies have been proposed and should be aligned with brain cancer patient treatment. The available evidence emphasizes an increasing role of vascular system in the understanding and treatment of inflammation and edema that often occur in the brain tumor, the disseminating coagulation processes, ACE2 target positive cancer patients, and suggests the need for combined anti-cancer and endothelial cell-associated therapies to treat brain cancer in conjunction with COVID-19 [347].",

            "COVID-19 is a severe respiratory disease caused by the newly identified human coronavirus (HCoV) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was discovered in December 2019, and in March 2020, the disease was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to a high number of cases. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory system, several studies have reported neurological complications in COVID-19 patients. Headache, dizziness, loss of taste and smell, encephalitis, encephalopathy, and cerebrovascular diseases are the most common neurological complications that are associated with COVID-19. In addition, seizures, neuromuscular junctions’ disorders, and Guillain–Barré syndrome were reported as complications of COVID-19, as well as neurodegenerative and demyelinating disorders. However, the management of these conditions remains a challenge. In this review, we discuss the prevalence, pathogenesis, and mechanisms of these neurological sequelae that are secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to update neurologists and healthcare workers on the possible neurological complications associated with COVID-19 and the management of these disease conditions.",
            "In December 2019, the novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the causative agent of the acute atypical cluster of pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan, China [1]. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease COVID-19 [2]. Although initially identified by respiratory symptoms, there have been increasing reports describing the copresentation of nonspecific neurological symptoms, including headache, dizziness, fatigue, and myalgia, impacting greater than 80% of all hospitalized patients [3]. What had previously been described only by pulmonary symptoms is now recognized by multiple neurological complications. Current data correlate the acuity of COVID-19 and mortality in critical care patients to the severity of neurological diseases, including acute necrotizing encephalopathy, encephalitis, epilepsy/seizures, and ataxia, increasing the risk of brain damage [4]. Additionally, peripheral nervous system (PNS) complications have been reported, including hypogeusia, hyposmia, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and skeletal muscle injury [5].",
            "In this review, we aim to provide updates to the most current neurological complications resulting from COVID-19 and the treatment guidelines for these conditions.",
            "We performed a systematic search on PubMed utilizing the search terms “Coronavirus and Neurological,” “SARS-COV-2 and Neurological,” and “COVID-19 and management strategies (neurological or stroke or encephalitis or encephalopathy or seizures)” published between January 2019 and February 2021, yielding 5378 articles. We further filtered for articles in English, yielding 5212. After duplications and articles not relevant to the purpose of this review, we evaluated over 750 publications resulting in the 241 we used to support our review.",
            "The blood–brain and blood–cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barriers are structured to prevent the invasion of the brain by pathogens and toxic molecules [6]; however, this is not totally impermeable. There are multiple mechanisms by which neurotropic viruses are able to traverse the blood–brain barrier (BBB), but the most common route is the hematogenous route, which starts by entering the bloodstream causing viremia [7,8]. Once in the blood, viruses are able to cross the BBB via transcytosis or the infection of endothelial cells [9,10], infected monocytes (“Trojan Horse” mechanism) [9], and paracellularly via disrupted tight junctions in the endothelial cells due to inflammation caused by the viremia [7,9]. Another route not dependent on viremia includes the coordination of dynein and kinesins proteins in the transport of the virus into the CNS using infected motor or sensory nerves [7]. Viruses can also enter the CNS through olfactory sensory neurons [7]. The latter is a more common route for respiratory coronaviruses [10].",
            "To date, seven CoVs have been associated with diseases in humans, which include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and most recently SARS-CoV-2 [11,12,13,14]. Only SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are recognized as causative agents of severe respiratory diseases, whereas all other human coronaviruses (HCoVs) typically present as mild diseases [15,16,17].",
            "Not different from many other viruses [7,18], CoVs are known to cause neurological complications [19,20,21,22,23]. However, the neuroinvasive mechanisms have not been well understood. Murray et al. presented the first evidence of the association of HCoVs with neurological disease in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients [24,25], with later studies confirming HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 in patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, Schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and meningoencephalitis [26]. A potential mechanism for CNS infection was suggested in a 2004 case study reporting the presence of HCoV-OC43 in nasopharyngeal and CSF samples of a child who was diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [19]. These findings were supported by St-Jean et al., who described the route of HCoV-OC43 infection of mice CNS through the olfactory bulb seven days after a nasal infection leading to acute encephalitis [20]. Additional murine studies confirmed the development of acute encephalitis in HCoV-OC43-infected BALB/c mice and HCoV-OC43-induced apoptosis in mice and rat neuronal cells [27]. These findings highlight the neurotropic characteristics of HCoVs and their ability to infect the CNS.",
            "Soon after the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002–2003, neurological complications were reported in SARS-CoV patients [28]. In addition to regular symptoms, such as fever, chills, productive cough, and diarrhea, patients developed neurological complications such as seizures, convulsions, and loss of consciousness during the course of the disease [29]. Tests later confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV in the CSF. With the new awareness of the pervasiveness of the disease, the examination of samples from patients who have died of SARS-CoV has revealed the presence of the SARS-CoV-N protein and viral RNA in several organs, including the stomach, small intestine, kidney, sweat glands, liver, and cerebrum [30]. The neurotropic property of SARS-CoV was further confirmed by a study in C57BL/6 mice, which showed that intranasal infection of mice eventually led to the infection of mice brain [31]. The previous findings indicate that SARS-CoV is capable of causing systemic infections, including CNS infections. In 2016, a study showed that some children who suffered acute encephalitis had a concurrent HCoV infection [32].",
            "Similar to other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with neurological complications, which are now recognized as initial symptoms in conjunction with the typical respiratory manifestations [33]. The most common neurological manifestations include headache, lethargy, unstable gait, ataxia, and seizures, in addition to PNS manifestations such as loss of taste and smell, vision impairment, nerve pain, and malaise [34]. The most serious developing neurological diseases include polyneuritis, Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), meningitis, encephalitis, and encephalopathy, in addition to cerebral hemorrhage and infarction [34]. Liotta et al., in a study of 509 COVID-19 patients, showed that 82% of these patients experienced neurological complications, which manifest early in 42% of patients and in 63% of patients at hospitalization [3]. Adjusting for age and severity of disease, younger patients and those presenting with severe COVID-19 are more likely to present with neurological manifestations, while older patients are more likely to develop a neurological disease (encephalopathies). These findings have been further supported by another study of 214 patients. In this study, 78 patients (36.4%) suffered from neurological consequences to COVID-19 [35]. These neurological complications manifest as CNS-related complications, such as dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizure, or as PNS manifestations, such as loss of taste and smell, vision impairment, and nerve pain, as well as skeletal muscular injury. There was a higher incidence of neurological complications in patients with severe COVID-19 than in mild COVID-19 patients.",
            "All the previous manifestations depend on the SARS-CoV-2 infection of host target cells; primarily unciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes in the lung, after binding to cell surface receptors; angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), basigin (BSG; CD147), and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) [36,37,38]. Cellular proteases such as TMPRSS2, furin, and cathepsins are required for priming the viral spike (S) protein, a process that is essential for viral entry after binding to host cell receptors [36]. Human brain single-nuclear RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data suggest low or no expression of ACE2 on different human brain cells and its microvasculature [39]. However, higher expression of other SARS-CoV-2 receptors, such as BSG and NRP-1, was reported in many brain cell types [39]. Moreover, host cell proteases are also expressed at different levels in most brain cells [39]. The previous findings suggest that the brain may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 invasion and infection.",
            "Studies have reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF and postmortem brain tissue of COVID-19 patients with encephalitis [40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48]. However, there are contradictory findings that may indicate that the neurological complications are due to severe systemic inflammation and not the direct invasion of the brain [49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56].",
            "It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could invade the CNS via the same routes as other HCoVs [hematogenous route (Figure 1A) or by using retrograde or antegrade transport mechanisms from peripheral nerves to the CNS (Figure 1B)] [33,40,57,58,59,60,61].",
            "One possible mechanism of the hematogenous route is binding to SARS-CoV-2 receptors on BBB endothelial cells, passing through endothelial cells by transcytosis, and finally reaching the brain (Figure 1A) [40,62]. The infection of endothelial cells does not involve any viral replication [33]. Because BSG and NRP1 are more highly expressed than ACE2 in the brain microvasculature, it is more likely that the SARS-CoV-2 would utilize these receptors to enter the CNS [39]. The other proposed mechanism involves infecting immune cells that express ACE2, such as monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes, (“Trojan horse” mechanism) (Figure 1A) [63,64,65,66,67]. The infected immune cells may then carry SARS-CoV-2 to the CNS, where it can infect the brain [68]. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in the lung macrophages of COVID-19 patients; however, viral replication in immune cells and immune infiltration of the brain need to be confirmed [69]. One additional mechanism is passing through disrupted endothelial cells’ tight junctions (paracellular route) (Figure 1A).",
            "As mentioned earlier, SARS-CoV-2 may also reach the CNS via peripheral nerves, more specifically the olfactory sensory neurons (Figure 1B) [57,58]. The high expression of ACE2 and the priming protease, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), in sustentacular cells, stem cells of the olfactory epithelium, and olfactory bulb may allow for retrograde or antegrade transport into the CNS [61,70,71,72,73,74].",
            "Cerebrovascular complications have been documented in 5% of COVID-19 patients, with 60% of these events attributed to an acute ischemic stroke [35,75,76]. The increased risk of these events is believed to be due to a hyperinflammatory/hypercoagulable state, and altered endothelial cell function resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2) [77,78,79,80,81]. Several studies have reported a significant increase in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum ferritin in COVID-19 patients with ischemic stroke, which could predict mortality in these patients [82,83,84,85,86,87]. Neutrophilia (increase in neutrophils) described in these patients results in the overproduction of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which has been shown to increase thrombi formation [88,89,90]. Furthermore, hypercoagulability and the increase in thrombi formation in COVID-19 patients could be explained by impaired fibrinolysis, low levels of natural anticoagulants, and high levels of coagulation factors and antiphospholipid antibodies [91,92,93,94]. The formation of thrombi is further potentiated by SARS-CoV-2-mediated damage of the endothelium, which results in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) depletion and subsequent deficiency of NO [95]. NO deficiency increases the risk of stroke because NO is a potent vasodilator and an inhibitor of platelets and leukocytes adhesion to the endothelium [95].",
            "Moreover, the internalization of ACE2, following the binding of SARS-CoV-2, leads to ACE2 depletion on the surface of endothelial cells, which may increase the incidence of ischemic stroke [96]. Data have shown a significant reduction in ACE2 expression on endothelial cells of SARS-CoV-2 patients [97]. Lack of ACE2 leaves angiotensin II (Ang II), a powerful vasoconstrictor, unregulated, thus increasing the risk of hypertension, blood coagulation, and ischemic stroke (Figure 2).",
            "A case study has reported acute stroke-like symptoms and intracranial hypertension in a 75-year-old Australian man due to severe inflammatory response to COVID-19 [98]. The neurological involvement in this case was not discovered until Day 26 postinfection, which highlights the importance of clinical values, such as NLR, lymphocyte-to-CRP ratio (LCRPR), and lymphocyte-to-platelet ratio (LPR), as prognostic indicators of severe inflammation and possible neurological complications. Other studies have shown that COVID-19-induced severe inflammation and inflammatory infiltrates consisting of T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils contribute to the rupture of atheromatous plaques in patients with pre-existing atheromatous disease due to the production of proteolytic enzymes and endothelial cell disruption [99,100,101]. Although the use of protease inhibitors in these patients may be beneficial, they should be carefully used as they may promote SARS-CoV-2-induced hypercoagulation.",
            "Following the occurrence of ischemic stroke, the production of proinflammatory mediators from activated immune cells and ischemic brain tissue could further promote brain injury [102,103]. Therefore, the suppression of inflammation in ischemic stroke could help ameliorate brain damage following ischemic stroke. However, further studies are needed to prove the therapeutic utility of this approach.",
            "In addition to ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage was observed in 0.5% of COVID-19 patients, similar to what was seen in MERS-CoV patients [35,104,105]. Coagulopathies and vascular disorders have been associated with hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients (Figure 2) [106]. It is also possible that reduced levels of ACE2 on endothelial cells of the brain microvasculature lead to blood coagulation and increased blood pressure, which may result in the rupture of blood vessels and hemorrhage (Figure 2) [97].",
            "The increased risk of hypercoagulable states has resulted in the suggested addendums for COVID-19 patients at risk of cerebral vascular incidents. [107,108,109,110]. The documented endothelial injury, changes in circulating prothrombotic factors, and increased stasis resulting from immobilization due to COVID-19 infection have warranted hypervigilance in the monitoring and prophylactic treatment of these patients. The International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis, American Society of Chest Physicians, and American College of Cardiology have approved interim guidelines for prophylactic treatment and management. However, it is important to note these are interim guidelines until quality evidence, supporting interventions different from current standard practice, are identified [111,112,113].",
            "Current recommendations for monitoring hospitalized at-risk patients include baseline complete blood count, levels of fibrinogen, D-dimer, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and inflammatory markers such as CRP and IL-6. The frequency of these tests is determined by the severity of the patient’s clinical presentations [114]. It is recommended that any abnormal findings in these measures are used for their prognostic value, and any changes to therapy should be the result of changes in signs or symptoms associated with stroke. Current treatment and management of patients presenting with active ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke do not differ from current recommendations, based on patients’ pre-existing conditions.",
            "The implementation of prophylactic anticoagulant treatment varies depending on pre-existing conditions. The use of anticoagulants presents with its own adverse effects. The outpatient recommendations are not different from current guidelines (https://www.isth.org/page/Published_Guidance, accessed on 14 April 2021). However, as inpatient recommendations for the treatment and management of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke due to COVID-19 are being evaluated, there is a consensus that thromboprophylaxis should be considered for all COVID-19 patients in intensive care units (ICUs) due to the increased risk of stasis [79,115].",
            "Encephalitis and meningitis are characterized by inflammation of the brain parenchyma and meninges, respectively [116]. The patient presents with headache, fever, vomiting, convulsions, and impaired sensations [60]. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in brain tissues and the CSF of COVID-19 patients who presented with meningitis or encephalitis, which indicates that the virus itself may cause this complication by infecting and damaging the brain (Figure 2) [40,41,42,60,117,118]. However, COVID-19 patients could also present with acute meningoencephalitis with no detectable SARS-CoV-2 or any other virus in the CSF [55,56,119]. The previous findings indicate that other mechanisms such as severe inflammation could be involved in the development of meningoencephalitis in COVID-19 patients. Based on the fatal consequences of encephalitis and meningoencephalitis, it should be considered as a possible complication in the management of COVID-19 patients. The early detection and treatment of meningoencephalitis are critical to prevent hemorrhagic encephalopathy that could be fatal.",
            "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is another complication characterized by demyelination of CNS following viral infections particularly in children; however, occurrence in adults is reported [120]. MRI images of a 51-year-old woman, who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, showed several demyelinating lesions that are consistent with ADEM [121]. Post-COVID-19-ADEM was further confirmed by the CNS axonal damage and the lesions, in an autopsy of a 71-year-old COVID-19 patient, which are typical of ADEM [122].",
            "Encephalopathy has also been described in 50% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients [123,124]. A study of several patients who died of COVID-19 showed that a significant number experienced hypoxic encephalopathy (Figure 2) [123]. Encephalopathy is more common in COVID-19 patients with coexisting or previous systemic and/or neurological complications [35,125]. Several cases that presented with altered mental state and confusion subsequent to COVID-19 did not have any evidence of CNS infection, which is typical of most cases of encephalopathy [125,126].",
            "Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) often presents as neurological symptoms following viral infection, toxemia, and hypoxia [60]. Because SARS-CoV-2 infection results in viremia and hypoxia, it is not surprising that SARS-CoV-2 is a causative agent of encephalopathy (Figure 2) [60,97]. ANE was reported in cases with COVID-19, and pre-existing conditions could increase the risk of ANE [125]. A brain MRI of patients showed bilateral hemorrhagic rim-enhancing lesions in the thalamic temporal lobes and subinsular regions [127,128,129]. The cytokine storm that is associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is believed to damage the BBB and cause brain necrosis in patients with severe COVID-19 (Figure 2) [127,128,129].",
            "Evaluation of the current literature does not indicate any changes or interim recommendations for COVID-19 patients that differ from the current recommended guidelines for the treatment and management of encephalopathy. However, because encephalopathy has been identified as a frequent finding among older COVID-19 patients [130] and is associated with poorer outcomes among this cohort [3,131], there has been hypervigilance in testing for COVID-19 among these patients. Following the diagnosis of encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, or ANE, recommendations are to start with CSF PCR analysis for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 or other potential contributing viral infections such as Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) [132]. Furthermore, the combined use of MRI and EEG appears to be very important in the detection of these cases [132].",
            "It is expected that some COVID-19 patients will develop seizures as a consequence of hypoxia, metabolic derangements, severe inflammation, organ failure, and cerebral affection (Figure 2) [41,133]. Indeed, seizures in COVID-19 patients have been reported due to SARS-CoV-2-induced brain damage, high levels of inflammatory mediators, and viral-induced encephalitis or meningitis [41,134,135,136]. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 reduces the seizures threshold which can worsen the case in epileptic patients or it can lead to seizures in patients with no history of seizures [137,138,139,140]. It is of note that seizures could be one of the initial symptoms in COVID-19 patients [141]. Focal seizures have been described in COVID-19 patients in addition to generalized tonic-clonic seizures [134]. Other than its presentation in adult COVID-19 patients, there were cases of seizures in COVID-19 children who present with fever or no fever (afebrile seizures) [142,143]. Therefore, it is important to consider seizures in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children regardless of the presence or absence of fever [142,143]. The management of seizures could include the use of antiepileptic drugs and monitoring of seizures by electroencephalography especially in severe COVID-19 patients [135]. It is critical to diagnose and recognize the typical and atypical presentation of seizures in COVID-19 patients to better diagnose, treat, and avoid any long-term complications of seizures [144].",
            "Current recommendations for the treatment and management of seizures and epilepsy for patients infected with COVID-19 do not differ from current guidelines. However, awareness of drug–drug interactions with COVID-19 treatment and the treatment for new or existing seizures must be considered when treating this patient population. The following discussion excludes the pediatric population because of limited early data that are reported among this group.",
            "Many of the medications currently used in the treatment and management of COVID-19 induce, or inhibit, and are metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450). These enzymes are also altered or involved in the metabolism of many of the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) frequently used in the treatment of seizure disorders.",
            "Lopinavir/ritonavir are protease inhibitors used in the treatment of COVID-19 [145]. These drugs are frequently used in combination and have been shown to induce multiple CYP450 enzymes (CYP2C9, 2C19, 1A2, and 2B6) and glucuronyl transferase [146]. This activity decreases the plasma concentration of lamotrigine (via glucuronyl transferase) and possibly phenytoin and valproate (via CYP enzymes), which are frequently used AEDs [147,148]. Additionally, lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentration may be reduced when used concomitantly with carbamazepine, phenytoin, and topiramate due to the ability of these AEDs to induce the CYP3A4 enzyme which metabolizes lopinavir/ritonavir [148].",
            "Remdesivir is an adenosine analog that targets the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and blocks viral RNA synthesis [145]. To date, there is limited information regarding the metabolism of remdesivir; however, it is partially metabolized via CYP3A4 (10%) [149]. This activity would result in reduced efficacy if used in combination with AEDs that induce this enzyme. Although there have been no drug interaction trials of remdesivir and concomitant AEDs it is important to note caution when used in combination with AEDs [150].",
            "Currently, there is neither experimental nor clinical evidence for any noticeable drug interactions between AEDs and antivirals such as favipiravir, nitazoxanide, and interferon-beta which suggests that these antivirals do not require additional dosing considerations when used with AEDs in the management of COVID-19 patients presenting with seizures.",
            "Patients could present with confusion and delirium as early signs of COVID-19 without any of the respiratory symptoms [151]. Accordingly, the early detection of AMS may help in the proper treatment and prevention of COVID-19 spread. It has been estimated that 9% of COVID-19 patients have AMS [152]. We believe that AMS could be the result of direct invasion of the brain or damage resulting from high levels of inflammatory mediators due to the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also believe that individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias are at high risk of COVID-19 and its associated morbidity and mortality. That could be attributed to the difficulty in applying disease prevention measures such as washing hands, social distancing, and isolation at home.",
            "Helms et al. reported that 118 (84.3%) of 140 COVID-19 patients, who were treated in two intensive care units (ICUs) in France, had mental changes including delirium, agitation, and corticospinal tract signs [153]. MRI showed bilateral frontotemporal hypoperfusion. About 33% of the 45 survivors experienced a dysexecutive syndrome suggestive of the involvement of the frontal lobe, which is responsible for an individual’s mental state [153]. Based on the above findings, we believe that changes in mental status could be an important diagnostic for COVID-19 because COVID-19 patients may only present with delirium and confusion.",
            "Patients with pre-existing or developing mental illness due to COVID-19 are expected to be treated with psychotropic drugs along with the standard treatment for the viral illness. Benzodiazepines (oxazepam and lorazepam), antidepressants (citalopram and escitalopram), antipsychotics (olanzapine), and the mood stabilizer (valproate) are suggested as safe considering the tolerability and minimal drug–drug interactions [154,155,156].",
            "GBS can occur following infections such as Campylobacter jejuni, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus due to molecular mimicry between peripheral nerve antigens and antigens of these pathogens [157]. Antipathogen antibodies can then cross-react with peripheral nerve antigens, causing inflammation and neuronal damage [157]. GBS has been described in several cases of COVID-19 patients, which manifest as weakness in the lower limbs and paresthesia and may progress to tetraparesis [49,158]. Nerve roots are typically involved, which is characterized by increased protein concentration in CSF and normal white blood cell count (cytoalbuminologic dissociation) [159,160]. It is of note that demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy and/or axonal damage are characteristics of GBS in COVID-19 patients [161,162]. GBS may manifest in individuals with COVID-19 even before the appearance of the typical flu-like symptoms [163]. Gupta et al. described the difference between GBS due to COVID-19 and other types of GBS [164]. COVID-19 GBS is more prevalent in the elderly and males, and COVID-19 GBS patients may experience fever, cough, dyspnea, ageusia, hyposmia 5–14 days before the paresthesia, lower limb weakness, and facial weakness [164]. Unfortunately, COVID-19 GBS has residual weakness, dysphagia, and extended ICU stay than other GBS types. Variants of GBS such as Miller Fisher syndrome and polyneuritis cranialis have also been reported in COVID-19 patients [4,163,165].",
            "Management of GBS is best achieved by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment [166,167]. Lopinavir/ritonavir use in COVID-19 with peripheral neuropathies is controversial because one study showed that protease inhibitors may increase the risk of peripheral neuropathy in patients with HIV [168]. However, other studies have found that lopinavir/ritonavir does not increase the risk of distal sensory polyneuropathy in HIV patients [169].",
            "Severe inflammation in critically ill COVID-19 patients could lead to neuromuscular junction dysfunction and myopathy [170,171]. The invasion of muscle cells, which express the ACE2 receptor, is also a possible mechanism [170,171]. On the other hand, the risk of COVID-19 infection increased with the use of immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapies in patients with autoimmune neuromuscular disorders [172,173,174].",
            "We studied different reports to propose a protocol for the management of myasthenia gravis (MG) and Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) during COVID-19 [175,176] and concluded the following.",
            "The MG expert panel suggests that decisions to manage every patient should be individualized, patients should take more precautions with extraordinary measures, and MG patients on immunosuppressive therapy should continue taking the medications. Hydroxychloroquine should be avoided in COVID-19 patients with MS or LEMS as the drug is reported to worsen MG [177,178]. The delay in initiation of the B-cell depleting therapy (rituximab) increases the risk of worsening myasthenia or myasthenia crisis [179,180].",
            "It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and Parkinson’s disease (PD) [181]. There is also no evidence of the acceleration of these diseases in COVID-19 patients [181]. However, the high expression of ACE2 in CNS and the brain damage that SARS-CoV-2 causes could lead to long-term neurodegenerative diseases/complications [182]. MS is characterized by nerve demyelination and brain neurodegeneration due to immune-mediated inflammation [181]. The SARS-CoV-2-mediated neurological damage that results from inflammation or direct invasion of the brain is similar to that caused by MS [183,184]. However, there is not enough evidence that SARS-CoV-2 leads to MS or that MS patients are more susceptible to COVID-19, its CNS involvement, or the reactivation of MS lesions due to SARS-CoV-2-mediated immune dysregulation [185,186,187]. A case of a 67-year-old woman who had MS and died of COVID-19 showed that SARS-CoV-2 did not infect neuronal or glial cells and infection did not result in disease exacerbation or reactivation of MS lesions [187]. The findings of the previous case are consistent with other studies, which showed that COVID-19 did not affect the course of autoimmune diseases [185,186].",
            "AD is another neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by neuroinflammation and neuronal loss and has many risk factors, which include age [188]. Several studies have shown that AD development could correlate with infections including viral infections [188]. Because SARS-CoV-2 infects/damages the CNS and induces severe inflammatory responses, it is possible that the long-term effect on cognitive function could develop in COVID-19 survivors [189]. To date, there is not enough evidence that SARS-CoV-2 causes or increases the risk of developing AD, as long-term studies are needed to draw this correlation. However, the infection of glutamate-producing and GABA-producing neurons by SARS-CoV-2 infection is a possible mechanism by which AD could develop secondary to COVID-19 [182].",
            "Similar to AD, PD patients suffer from cognitive and memory issues in addition to the impairment of motor function [190]. Although ACE2 is widely expressed in CNS and SARS-CoV-2 infects and damages several sites in the brain, there is no direct evidence that SARS-CoV-2 induces or increases the risk of PD development or that PD patients are at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 [191,192]. There is not any evidence too that PD worsens during the course of COVID-19 disease [192]. However, it is highly possible that SARS-CoV-2 could be linked to PD development or its acceleration once more studies are conducted and follow-up of COVID-19 survivors is done over the next few years.",
            "The most common neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 are headache, dizziness, myalgia, fatigue, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and visual impairment. These symptoms are seen in 30 to 45.5% of patients [35,193,194].",
            "Headache is one of the most common neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients and could be the first symptom of COVID-19 in a few patients (Figure 2) [35,195,196,197]. It occurred in 6-25% of COVID-19 patients depending on the study, and the intensity is often described as moderate to severe [152,198,199,200,201,202,203,204]. It has been noticed that headache as a result of COVID-19 starts as moderate pain due to systemic spread of the virus, whereas after a few days, severe inflammation could lead to photophobia and neck stiffness [205].",
            "Past medical histories of several COVID-19 patients indicate that headache has been a regular complaint [199]. However, there are other cases in which COVID-19 patients never had any headache in their medical history and only experienced headache after SARS-CoV-2 infection, which suggests that headache is a complication of COVID-19 [206]. It has been suggested that headache occurs in COVID-19 patients as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the nasal cavity trigeminal nerve endings [198]. Furthermore, headache could be due to infection of endothelial cells of the vessels in the trigeminovascular system [198]. The high level of proinflammatory cytokines could also irritate the trigeminal nerve endings leading to headache [198]. In our opinion, in addition to all the above-described mechanisms, headache could also occur due to lack of sleep, isolation, and anxiety in COVID-19 patients. Despite being a common symptom in COVID-19, headache can be easily treated by analgesics.",
            "Dizziness is also reported as one of the common neurological symptoms that presents in 8–9% of COVID-19 patients (Figure 2) [35,207,208]. It is even reported, in some COVID-19 cases, to be more commonly occurring than headache [35]. A COVID-19 case for a 53-year-old woman was described, and dizziness was reported as an initial symptom along with dry throat, while fever, cough, and headache were absent [209]. Antiviral and other drug treatments resulted in case improvement. Therefore, it is important to watch for dizziness as one of the neurological complications that may help in the diagnosis of COVID-19 even in absence of respiratory symptoms.",
            "Myalgia and fatigue have been commonly reported in COVID-19 patients (Figure 2) [35,193,194,207,208]. Depending on the study, fatigue was a complaint in 26–51% of patients, whereas 3–64% of patients had myalgia [210]. It has been postulated that myalgia in COVID-19 patients is due to severe inflammation and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines [211]. However, muscle invasion by SARS-CoV-2 remains a possibility because muscles express the ACE2 receptor. Some patients showed fatigue, muscle soreness, and elevated muscle enzyme levels such as creatine kinase all of which may be related to systemic inflammation and muscle damage [212].",
            "Hyposmia (anosmia) and hypogeusia (ageusia) are loss of smell and taste, respectively, and they are among the most common early symptoms of COVID-19 (Figure 2) [213,214,215]. They are reported by up to 88% of COVID-19 patients with mild or moderate disease and therefore could be used for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [35,216,217,218,219]. Anosmia could appear as an initial symptom and is not accompanied by nasal inflammation [220,221]. Using MRI, an abnormal appearance of the olfactory bulb has been described in COVID-19 patients [220,221]. Infection of the olfactory epithelium and trigeminal nerves by SARS-CoV-2 may explain the loss of smell and taste in COVID-19 patients [222,223]. Because anosmia is highly prevalent and an early symptom of COVID-19, it can be used for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 [224]. This may help in the early isolation and treatment of COVID-19 patients, which could eventually result in a decline in the number of new cases.",
            "Post-COVID-19 Neurological Syndrome (PCNS) indicates prolonged post-COVID-19 neurological symptoms. Several reports have shown that PCNS could present in the form of long-term symptoms that persist for months such as muscle pain and weakness, myopathy, sleep impairment, anxiety, depression, severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dizziness, headaches, and anosmia [225,226]. The previous findings suggest that COVID-19 patients should be followed up after recovery for possible long-term post-COVID-19 neurological complications.",
            "The high expression of ACE2 in the brain and peripheral nerves allows SARS-CoV-2 to infect the nervous system and cause neurological damage, which is manifested as complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection [57]. Because ACE2 has several physiological functions, including the regulation of blood pressure, its usage by SARS-CoV-2 as an entry receptor may lead to its depletion and the accumulation of Ang II [227,228,229]. Elevated Ang II would result in increased blood pressure due to vasoconstriction and fluid retention [229]. Moreover, high levels of Ang II would promote inflammation and blood coagulation. Complications due to ACE2 depletion could be manifested as cerebrovascular diseases in COVID-19 patients (Figure 2).",
            "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which occurs as a consequence of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, could lead to hypoxia that can have deleterious effects on the brain, including edema, congestion, and neuronal degeneration (Figure 2) [64,202,230]. This hypoxia-induced brain damage is typically seen in hypoxic encephalopathy and ischemic stroke secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is important to note that direct damage of the brain by SARS-CoV-2 could also lead to respiratory failure and hypoxia [61]. One of the reasons behind ARDS is the severe inflammation due to the release of an excessive amount of proinflammatory cytokines that could be responsible for tissue damage in the lungs and other organs including the brain [202,231,232]. Severe inflammation was also noted locally in the brain after SARS-CoV-2 invasion due to the production of proinflammatory cytokines by astrocytes and microglia [21]. This also contributes to brain damage. Accordingly, therapies, such as IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies, which aim to reduce inflammation, have been used to prevent inflammation-dependent complications in COVID-19 patients [233].",
            "Severe inflammation in COVID-19 patients, the infection of endothelial cells, and the activation of coagulation cascade could lead to hypercoagulability and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) that is commonly seen in COVID-19 patients (Figure 2) [77,78,79,80,81]. The severe systemic inflammation on hospital admission could predict mortality in COVID-19 patients [87]. Stroke could be a consequence if anticoagulants are not administered [234,235]. A study demonstrated that serial systemic immune inflammation indices (SSIIi), which are determined based on neutrophil, platelet, and lymphocyte counts, are clinically correlated with PCNS events [236]. This implies that SSIIi could be used as a biomarker for many neurological complications including stroke.",
            "Severe immunosuppression could be also implicated in COVID-19 patients with severe disease [237]. Circulating effector T cells were significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients [237]. In some patients, IL-6 was elevated but without elevations in other proinflammatory cytokines. It was noted too that blood mononuclear cells are less activated and produce lower levels of cytokines. All of the above suggests that immune responses may be impaired in some COVID-19 patients, which could lead to uncontrolled viral spread and tissue/organ damage including the CNS. Other studies reported an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients [238]. Moreover, another study found that in severe COVID-19 patients, there is a high level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG antibodies [239]. This may indicate that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection could play a role in mediating the infection of immune cells that express the Fcγ receptor for IgG [240,241]. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can also cross-react with antigens in the nervous system causing complications such as GBS [158]. Based on these findings, overactivation of the immune system leads to hyperinflammation, whereas immunosuppression could result in the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. Both of these mechanisms would eventually cause tissue damage.",
            "The health care system is posed with a huge challenge of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Several neurological manifestations have been described in COVID-19 patients; however, more research needs to be performed to understand the pathogenic mechanism behind each of these disorders to better treat such patients with suitable drugs and in a timely manner. We believe that some of the available treatment options might potentially lead to a wave of neurological sequelae. Therefore, treatment of COVID-19 patients should consider the existing or the unknown neurological complications that may develop.",

Transcellular migration which involves binding of the virus to its receptors; ACE2, basigin (BSG), or neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), on brain microvasculature endothelial cells then crossing endothelial cells via transcytosis, 2. Infecting immune cells which then carry the virus across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells into the CNS (Trojan Horse mechanism), and 3.

This leads to hypoxia- and inflammation-induced encephalopathy and seizures. Brain damage due to viral replication may lead to encephalitis. Severe systemic inflammation could result in hypercoagulability which may eventually lead to stroke. Nonspecific symptoms due to nervous system affections include headache, dizziness, loss of taste and smell, and myalgia. Usage of ACE2 receptor; by SARS-CoV-2, to infect target cells, including endothelial cells, would deplete the receptor resulting in the accumulation of angiotensin II (AngII). High levels of AngII promote vasoconstriction, fluid retention, inflammation, and blood coagulation, which could result in ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. This figure was created with BioRender.com."

            "Neurological symptoms are frequently observed in COVID-19. Here, we examine the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate infection of neurons in three separate approaches: mouse model, human brain organoid, and autopsy of COVID-19 patients.",
            "Although COVID-19 is considered to be primarily a respiratory disease, SARS-CoV-2 affects multiple organ systems including the central nervous system (CNS). Yet, there is no consensus on the consequences of CNS infections. Here, we used three independent approaches to probe the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect the brain. First, using human brain organoids, we observed clear evidence of infection with accompanying metabolic changes in infected and neighboring neurons. However, no evidence for type I interferon responses was detected. We demonstrate that neuronal infection can be prevented by blocking ACE2 with antibodies or by administering cerebrospinal fluid from a COVID-19 patient. Second, using mice overexpressing human ACE2, we demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion in vivo. Finally, in autopsies from patients who died of COVID-19, we detect SARS-CoV-2 in cortical neurons and note pathological features associated with infection with minimal immune cell infiltrates. These results provide evidence for the neuroinvasive capacity of SARS-CoV-2 and an unexpected consequence of direct infection of neurons by SARS-CoV-2.",
            "As of September 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected >25 million people globally. While a majority of COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, neurological involvement, including impaired consciousness and headache, have been reported in patients (Mao et al., 2020). To date, human autopsy studies have identified viral RNA transcripts in brain tissues (Puelles et al., 2020; Solomon et al., 2020) and viral proteins in the endothelial cells within the olfactory bulb (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020) in people who succumbed to COVID-19. Several reports have come out indicating SARS-CoV-2 infection of the central nervous system (CNS) cells (Bullen et al., 2020; Jacob et al., 2020; Pellegrini et al., 2020; Ramani et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). However, there are still many unknowns regarding the frequency or the consequences of neuroinvasion. Understanding the full extent of viral invasion is crucial to treating patients as we begin to try to figure out the long-term consequences of COVID-19, many of which are predicted to have possible CNS involvement (De Felice et al., 2020; Heneka et al., 2020; Pereira, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).",
            "Because the CNS is not the primary organ affected by SARS-CoV-2, studying neurological disease in COVID-19 patients systemically provides several challenges, including having only a subset of the population of patients with neuroinvasion, lacking technology to sample CNS tissues directly, and distinguishing direct neuroinvasion versus systemic viremia within the brain. Therefore, robust, reliable model systems are required to answer the questions underlying SARS-CoV-2 neuropathology. During the Zika virus (ZIKV) pandemic, several groups used human brain organoids to answer key questions regarding ZIKV neuroinvasion and its consequences (Garcez et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2019). Using a similarly well-characterized human brain organoid model (Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014; Lancaster et al., 2013), we test the infection capacity of SARS-CoV-2 in CNS tissue. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we uncover the transcriptional changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection of neurons.",
            "Beyond the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, the question remains whether ACE2 is the main route of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into neuronal cells and what strategies might block viral infection. ACE2 expression in the CNS, and in neurons in particular, is still unclear (Xia and Lazartigues, 2008). Moreover, in addition to ACE2, other cofactors such as TMPRSS2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020) and Neuropilin-1 (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020; Daly et al., 2020) seem to affect infection rates, but it is unclear if these are also required for neuronal infection. Thus, we used transcriptional profiling along with blocking antibody studies to demonstrate the requirement of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to infect neurons.",
            "To gain in vivo relevance for these findings, we examine the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 using mouse models of SARS-CoV-2, and observe vascular remodeling in infected regions, independent of vascular infection, providing a valuable tool that can be used to dissect out the consequences of CNS infection. Finally, by examining postmortem COVID-19 patient brain tissues, we provide evidence of neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV-2 and identify associations between infection and ischemic infarcts in localized brain regions.",
            "To dissect the mode and consequences of infection, we first established the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 in a human brain model system. We used human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines (Y1 and Y6), derived from healthy individuals (Fig. 1), to generate forebrain-specific human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs). In culture, we observed replication of SARS-CoV-2 in 2-wk-old hNPCs, with peak viral titers as early as 12 h postinfection (hpi; Fig. S1, A and B). In addition, Tdt-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining indicated increased cell death (Fig. S1 A). Next, we generated hiPSC-derived brain organoids (Amin and Paşca, 2018; Pellegrini et al., 2020; Qian et al., 2016; Velasco et al., 2019) to model the SARS-CoV-2 infection of neuronal cells in 3D. We confirmed a dorsal cortical identity of organoids by immunostaining for markers FOXG1, PAX6, and CTIP2 (Fig. S2 C). Similar to a recent report (Ramani et al., 2020), we observed infection of neuronal cells in 9-wk-old organoids as early as 24 hpi, with significantly increased number of SARS-CoV-2–positive cells at 96 hpi (Fig. 2, A–C; and Fig. S1 C). Although the majority of the SARS-CoV-2–infected cells were localized within MAP2-positive cellular fields of mature neurons (Fig. 2 B [2] and Fig. S1 C), we also observed infection of SOX2-positive neural stem cells with bipolar morphology and cells localized around the neural tube–like structures (Fig. 2 B [1]). We observed an increase in SARS-CoV-2–positive cells 96 hpi compared with 24 hpi (Fig. 2 C and Fig. S1, C–E). 96 hpi, we observed a widespread infection, mostly limited to the regions with high cortical cell density in the organoid (Fig. 2 D). Using electron microscopy, we visualized viral particles within the organoid (Fig. 2 E), with discrete regions of high-density virus accumulation (Fig. 2 E [1]) and other regions showing viral budding from ER-like structures (Fig. 2 E [2–4]), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is able to use the neuronal cell machinery to replicate. Organoid infection resulted in extensive neuronal cell death; strikingly, however, the majority of TUNEL-positive cells were SARS-CoV-2 negative (Fig. 2, F and G; and Fig. S1 F), and only ∼15% of the cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 were TUNEL positive (Fig. 2 H). Increased cell death was correlated with a higher density of SARS-CoV-2–positive cells (Fig. 2 I), which, however, were not overtly dying (Fig. 2, G and H). Even within a single plane, we noticed the high-density SARS-CoV-2 area to have more TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 2 J, yellow box) compared with low-density SARS-CoV-2 regions (Fig. 2 J, white box). Together, these data indicated that SARS-CoV-2 can infect cells of neural origin and suggested that infected cells can promote death of nearby cells.",

            "We hypothesized that the cellular heterogeneity of brain organoids may be leading to certain cells being more susceptible to infection and others to death, and that this system would provide an ideal platform to understand the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS and elucidate the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion. To address these questions, we performed single-cell RNA-seq to dissect the cellular states and transcriptional changes occurring after SARS-CoV-2 infection in both infected and noninfected cells within the organoid. We analyzed 60-d-old organoids that were either mock infected or infected with SARS-CoV-2 and collected at 2, 24, and 96 hpi (n = 2 for each time point); 96,205 cells were used to create 31 distinct clusters (Fig. S3 A). Annotations from previous studies (Cakir et al., 2019; Kanton et al., 2019; Velasco et al., 2019) allowed us to characterize the identity of each cluster (Fig. S3, A–C). Monocle trajectory further classified these clusters into four major cellular states: neural progenitors/outer radial glia, intermediate progenitor/interneurons, neurons, and cortical neurons (Fig. S3, B–D). To confirm the cell-types we found in the single-cell sequencing, we used additional staining with dorsal cortical markers CTIP2, PAX6, and TBR1 and observed infection primarily overlapping with CTIP2-positive, PAX6-negative cells or CTIP2/TBR1 double-positive, Pax6-negative cells, which are neuronal cells with a deep-layer fate (layers 5/6). We also observed infection of SATB2-positive, CTIP2-negative cells or SATB2/CTIP2 double-positive cells, indicating that upper-layer cortical neurons are also susceptible to infection in the organoid model.",

            "Comparing global UMAP clusters in specimens collected before and after infection, we were able to identify cellular population changes during infection (Fig. 4). With an added SARS-CoV-2 annotation, SARS-CoV-2 transcript reads were localized to a variety of cell clusters (Fig. 3 A), demonstrating the widespread infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in neurons, radial glia, and neuronal progenitor cells. Several cell clusters showed large changes in their representation within the organoid, such as cluster 1 (from 5% to ∼20% of the population), or cluster 7 (from ∼10% to nearly 0%; Fig. 4). However, this was not uniformly seen with all infected clusters, as cells in cluster 11 showed high infection rates (Fig. 3 G) but little change in population representation (Fig. 4). This is consistent with findings from TUNEL staining (Fig. 2, E–G), which demonstrated minimal overlap between SARS-CoV-2–infected cells and those undergoing cell death. Alternatively, it is possible that infection resulted in differentiation or change in cell’s phenotype in populations such as cluster 7, which is characterized to be a transitional cell type.",

            "Next, we compared the changes in the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2–infected organoids with another well-studied neurotropic virus: ZIKV. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after a brain organoid infection with ZIKV (Watanabe et al., 2017) showed almost no overlap with DEGs from SARS-CoV-2–infected organoids (Fig. 5 B). In both cases, the transcriptome showed evidence of viral infection and invasion (Fig. 5 D). However, unique processes were enriched in each of the infections. SARS-CoV-2–infected brain organoid up-regulated pathways related to cell division, organelle fission, and metabolic processes, while ZIKV showed enrichment in type I IFN pathways (Fig. 5 D). SARS-CoV-2 induced a unique transcriptional state within neurons compared with ZIKV, consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 induces a moderate IFN-stimulated gene response in other tissues (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020) and previous reports of specific virus replication being controlled by alternative pathways by neurons (Daniels et al., 2019; Yordy et al., 2012).",

            "To understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the brain organoid at the cellular level, we characterized cells that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 versus neighboring uninfected cells without the presence of SARS-CoV-2 transcript, in cluster 11, which comprised the highest number of infected cells 96 hpi. SARS-CoV-2–positive cells showed enrichment of genes corresponding to viral transcription, along with enrichment for metabolic processes including electron transport–coupled proton transport, cytochrome c to oxygen, and NADH to ubiquinone (Fig. 5 E, top panel). Conversely, SARS-CoV-2–negative cells showed a mitochondrial catabolic state with the up-regulation of alcohol metabolism, cholesterol synthesis, and regulation of cell death (Fig. 5 E, bottom panel). These two cell populations displayed antagonizing pathway enrichment, with the infected cells responding to hyperoxia and the bystander cells responding to hypoxia (Fig. 5 E, highlight in yellow). The hypermetabolic state is unique to the SARS-CoV-2–infected cells (Fig. 5 C) and highlights the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to hijack the host neuron machinery to replicate (Fig. 2 D). Finally, we confirmed that infection by SARS-CoV-2 induced a locally hypoxic environment in neuronal regions by staining for HIF1α (Fig. 5, F and G) in mock-infected and SARS-CoV-2–infected organoids. Together, these results indicate the potential of SARS-CoV-2 in manipulating host metabolic programming, which may create a resource-restricted environment for cells.",
            "One of the ongoing questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion is that mRNA levels of ACE2 appear to be very low in the CNS (Li et al., 2020; Qi et al., 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020). Indeed, our single-cell RNA-seq dataset demonstrated low levels of ACE2; it was, however, detectable in many clusters (Fig. S2 A). In addition, we did not observe a correlation between the percentage of cells infected in each cluster to ACE2, TMPRSS2, or Neuropilin-1 expression (Fig. S2 B). However, it remained possible that ACE2 protein may be expressed on the cell surface to promote viral entry. Consistent with this idea, we found widespread expression of ACE2 protein in both MAP2-positive neurons and cells in the neural tube-like structures of the organoids (Fig. 6 A), indicating that the mRNA level of ACE2 does not accurately reflect ACE2 protein expression. In addition, we used postmortem human brain tissue to stain for neurons and ACE2 and found that neurons in the cortical gray matter colocalized with ACE2 staining (Fig. S2 C, yellow arrow), and we found other cells in the vicinity that also stained for ACE2 (Fig. S2 C, white arrow). To test the requirement of ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we incubated organoids with an anti-ACE2 blocking monoclonal antibody before infection with SARS-CoV-2. We detected significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection upon pretreatment with ACE2 antibody compared with isotype control, indicating the requirement of ACE2 for infection of brain organoids (Fig. 6, B and F; and Fig. S2 C).",

            "Next, we investigated whether there are humoral antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS of infected patients, and whether antibodies present in the CNS can prevent infection of neurons. We analyzed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a patient hospitalized with COVID-19 and acute encephalopathy (Fig. 6 C) and from a healthy control volunteer by performing ELISA against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 6 D). We detected IgG antibodies specific to the spike protein in the patient’s CSF even at 100× dilution (Fig. 6 D). Using this patient’s CSF, we performed a neutralization assay against SARS-CoV-2 and validated its efficacy in preventing brain organoid infection (Fig. 6 E). CSF-containing antiviral antibodies blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection in organoids (Fig. 6, E and F; and Fig. S2 D).",
            "To examine the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a more physiologically complete system, we examined the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo by using transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 under the K18 promoter (K18-hACE2; McCray et al., 2007). Similar to previous reports of SARS-CoV showing neurotropism (McCray et al., 2007; Netland et al., 2008), we observed increasing viral titers in the brain of mice after intranasal administration of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 7, A and B). We next analyzed the distribution of the virus in the whole brain by immunolabeling against the nucleocapsid protein, clearing, and light sheet microscopy imaging using iDISCO+ (Renier et al., 2014; Fig. 7 and Video 1). 7 d after infection, the virus was widely present in neural cells throughout the forebrain (Fig. 7 C). The cortex was unevenly infected, as the infected cells were visible in columnar patches and in sensory regions, while the layer 4 was mostly devoid of infection (Fig. 7, C and D). We mapped the density of infected cells using ClearMap (Renier et al., 2016) and confirmed that most brain regions contained a high density of infected cells, with the notable exception of the cerebellum (Fig. 7 E). Other regions also contained a relatively low density of infected cells, for instance the dentate gyrus, the globus pallidus, and cortical layer 4. Of note, whole-brain analysis of the virus distribution did not detect the presence of the virus in the vascular endothelium. To explore the possibility that the viral expression by neural cells could indirectly affect the organization of the vascular network, we double-labeled brains for the nucleocapsid protein and the vascular endothelium with CD31 and Podocalyxin, and used ClearMap again to reconstruct the whole-brain vascular network 7 d after infection (Fig. 7 F; Kirst, 2020). We focused on the organization of the cortical vasculature. In infected brains, we focused on hot spots of infections represented as the number of detected infected cells and measured the density and orientation of all blood vessels. In many instances, the expression of the virus coincided with a disruption in the normal vascular topology expected in the cortex, with an important loss of the normal enrichment in radially oriented vessels in upper layers.",

            "To dissect the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS versus the respiratory system, we directed expression of human ACE2 using an adeno-associated virus vector (AAV-hACE2; Israelow et al., 2020) to the lungs via intratracheal delivery or to the brain via intracisternal delivery (Fig. 7 H). Mice were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 either intranasally or intraventricularly. Intranasally infected mice showed signs of lung pathology (Israelow et al., 2020) but no weight loss or death (Fig. 7, I and J). However, intraventricular administration of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in weight loss and death, even at the challenge virus dose 100-fold lower than that used for intranasal infection (Fig. 7, I and J). Altogether, these results highlight the neuroreplicative potential and lethal consequences of SARS-CoV-2 CNS infection in mice.",
            "Finally, to determine whether there is evidence of SARS-CoV-2 CNS infection in COVID-19 patients, we examined formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections of three patients who died after suffering from severe COVID-19–related complications. All patients had been admitted to the intensive care unit, they were sedated and ventilated due to respiratory failure (days 3, 10, and 18 for patients 3, 1, and 2, respectively), and their difficulty to be weaned from mechanical ventilation indicated the severity and highly pathogenic nature of the disease course (Table 1). We sampled several regions of the brain and stained with H&E and for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with a validated protocol and antibody we have used previously (Hosier et al., 2020). While in control slides, there was no positive immunohistochemical staining for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, samples from COVID-19 patients showed distinct and specific spike protein staining, albeit to different degrees (Fig. 8 and Fig. S3). Neuropathological evaluations identified staining with anti-spike antibodies in cortical neurons (Fig. 8 A, Fig. 8 B [upper panel], and Fig. 8 D [black arrows]), along with signal in endothelial cells (Fig. 8 B, lower panel). In patient 1, medium spiny neurons in the basal ganglia did not show staining, however, similar to substantia nigra neurons in the midbrain, which were also negative for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Fig. S4). The cellular staining pattern showed diffuse cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining, along with concentrated regions within the cells, consistent with our findings using electron microscopy in the organoids, which demonstrated localized hotspots within the infected cell. Tissue samples from patients with cells that were lipofuscin laden or contained microinfarcts but without COVID-19 showed no reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 antibody, signifying the specificity of the antibody used. Patient 3, who failed to regain consciousness after cessation of sedation, was diagnosed with severe global encephalopathy and was noted to have multiple diffuse microbleeds, as demonstrated by diagnostic imaging (magnetic resonance imaging). Upon histological examination, we found multiple microscopic ischemic infarcts in the subcortical white matter, ranging from acute to subacute, and with focal hemorrhagic conversion (Fig. 8 C and Fig. S5 A). These varying stages of infarction indicated a temporal sequence of continued ischemic events. Most infarcts showed signs of tissue damage and localized cell death, and positive viral staining was present predominantly around the edges of the infarct and to a lesser degree within the center. At the hyperacute stage of infarction, viral proteins were present in endothelium. These infarcts are present predominantly in subcortical white matter, not within the cortex. In other samples, we found suspected viral staining in locally ischemic regions (Fig. 8 D and Fig. S5, B and C). Remarkably, all the regions of positive viral staining showed no lymphocyte or leukocyte infiltration. This is in contrast to other neurotropic viruses (ZIKV, rabies virus, and herpes virus) in which the infection is typically accompanied by large number of immune cell infiltrates, including T cells. These findings suggest that, although SARS-CoV-2 has neurotropic properties and can infect neurons in patients, it did not invoke an immune response typical of other neurotropic virus in this particular case.",

            "We examined the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to infect neural tissues of both mice and human origin and demonstrate potential consequences of its neuroinvasion. Our results suggest that neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 may be related to consequences of direct viral invasion of the CNS. Specifically, our work experimentally demonstrates that the brain is a site for high replicative potential for SARS-CoV-2. We further show that SARS-CoV-2 causes significant neuronal death in human brain organoids. Using electron microscopy, we identified viral particles budding from the ER, indicating the virus’s ability to use the neuron cell machinery to replicate. Similar to neuronal loss observed in patient autopsies (Solomon et al., 2020), we noticed large numbers of cells dying in the organoid; however, this neuronal death did not colocalize directly with virus infection. Single-cell RNA-seq of the infected organoids showed metabolic changes in neurons without IFN or IFN-stimulated gene signatures, indicating that the neuroinvasive consequence of SARS-CoV-2 is unique compared with other neurotropic viruses such as ZIKV. Closer examination showed diverging metabolic changes in infected versus neighboring cells, suggesting that the infected cells can cause local changes to their microenvironment, affecting survival of nearby cells. It is possible that viral infection induces locally hypoxic regions, which aids in lowering the threshold for tissue damage in the context of an already oxygen-deprived state.",
            "While ACE2 expression levels in the human brain are still being investigated, we showed that ACE2 is expressed at the protein level and is functionally required for SARS-CoV-2 infection in human brain organoids. Further, we detected robust antiviral antibody presence in the CSF of a COVID-19 patient who presented with acute neurological symptoms. This finding suggests that, at least in some patients with COVID-19 and neurological symptoms, there is robust antibody response against the virus within the CSF. In the in vivo setting of the CNS with vasculature and immune cells, neuronal death could have cascading downstream effects in causing and amplifying CNS inflammation.",
            "Although our rodent model does not use endogenous ACE2 expression, it has been previously reported that even mouse-adapted SARS-CoV is still neurotropic in wild-type mice, and SARS-CoV-2 is neurotropic in mice with hACE2 expression from the endogenous locus (Roberts et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2020). Using mouse models, we demonstrate for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion in mice can have significant remodeling of brain vasculature, providing a potential link between the hypoxia and what we see in both the human organoid and the patient brains.",
            "Similar to previous reports of acute hypoxic ischemic damage without microthrombi in postmortem brain of COVID-19 patients (Solomon et al., 2020), we also found presence of ischemic damage and microinfarcts in postmortem brain samples of COVID-19 patients. In our study, we observed evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the regions of micro–ischemic infarcts, suggesting the possibility of neuroinvasion-associated ischemia and vascular anomalies, consistent with what we observed in mice. However, a limitation of our study is that autopsy samples from only a small number of patients were examined, providing a snapshot of case reports from several patients rather than a generalizable phenomenon. Future studies are needed to examine whether there are other cases of neuroinvasion in the CNS, and the predisposition for such infection. Although we are unable to determine the exact relationship between neuroinvasion and ischemic infarcts, we pose a possible hypothesis from our findings in the patients, mice, and infections of human brain organoids: that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion may cause locally hypoxic regions and disturbance of vasculature, and the disruption of brain vasculature can make vulnerable ischemic infarcts and regions more susceptible to viral invasion (Fig. 8 E). Our findings expand the utility of human brain organoids, beyond modeling fetal brains, and highlight the importance of using a variety of approaches to best model physiology of the human brain.",
            "In future studies, identifying the route of SARS-CoV-2 invasion into the brain, in addition to determining the sequence of infection in different cell types in the CNS, will help validate the temporal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and ischemic infarcts in patients. It may be through the nasal cavity–to-CNS connection through the cribriform plate, olfactory epithelium and nerve, or viremia, but regardless, the brain should be considered a SARS-CoV-2–susceptible organ system upon respiratory exposure (Baig and Sanders, 2020; Coolen et al., 2020).",

After immunostaining, the samples were washed in PBS-T (twice for 1 h and then overnight), dehydrated in a methanol/water increasing concentration series (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%, 1 h each, and then methanol 100% overnight), followed by a wash in 66% dichloromethane and 33% methanol for 3 h. Methanol was washed out with two final washes in dichloromethane 100% (15 min each), and finally the samples were cleared and stored in dibenzyl ether (Sigma-Aldrich) until light sheet imaging.",
            "We imaged with a 4× 0.35-NA objective cropped elongated field of view (600 × 2,200 µm) covering the narrow waist of the light sheet at 1.63 µm/pixel of lateral resolution, 1.6-µm spacing. A reference channel for registration to the annotated atlas using the sample autofluorescence was acquired at 5 µm/pixel. The acquisitions were done on a LaVision Ultramicroscope II equipped with infinity-corrected objectives. The microscope was installed on an active vibration filtration device, itself put on a marble compressed-air table. Imaging was done with the following filters: 595 nm/40 mW for Alexa Fluor 555, and 680 nm/30 mW for Alexa Fluor 647. The microscope was equipped with the following laser lines: OBIS-561 nm, 100 mW, OBIS-639 nm, 70 mW, and used the second-generation LaVision beam combiner. The images were acquired with an Andor complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sNEO camera. Main acquisitions were done with the LVMI-Fluor 4×/0.3 WD6 LaVision Biotec objective. The brain was positioned in sagittal orientation, cortex side facing the light sheet. A field of view of 400 × 1,300 pixels was cropped at the center of the camera sensor. The light sheet numerical aperture was set to NA 0.1. Beam width was set to the maximum. Only the center-left light sheet was used. Laser powers were set to 100% (639 nm) or 10% (561 nm). Tile overlaps were set to 10%. The acquisition routine was set to the following: (1) Z-drive → save ome.tif stack; (2) filter change → Z-drive → save ome.tif stack; (3) change x position → repeat 1,2 12 times; and (4) change y position → repeat 1,2,3 6 times. At the end of the acquisition, the objective is changed to a MI PLAN 1.1×/0.1 for the reference scan at 488 nm excitation (tissue autofluorescence). The field of view is cropped to the size of the brain, the z-steps are set to 6 µm, and light sheet numerical aperture is set to 0.03 NA.",

            "In December 2019, in Wuhan (China), a highly pathogenic coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, dramatically emerged. This new virus, which causes severe pneumonia, is rapidly spreading around the world, hence it provoked the COVID-19 pandemic. This emergency launched by SARS-CoV-2 also had, and still has, devastating socio-economic aspects. Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable groups of people is crucial for the adaptation of governments’ responses. Growing scientific evidence suggests that it is essential to keep the attention on people after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection; indeed, some clinical manifestations are frequently present even after recovery. There is consensus on the need to define which symptoms persist after the infection and which disabilities may arise after COVID-19. Recent reviews, case reports, and original contributions suggest that various organs may be affected, and neurological symptoms are present in about one third of patients with COVID-19. Neurological complications after severe COVID-19 infection might include delirium, brain inflammation, stroke, and nerve damage. In the recent pandemic, neurologists and neurobiologists have a chance to study key features of infection neurology. Furthermore, the psychological impact of the pandemic should not be underestimated, although there is currently no definition for this condition.",
            "In December 2019, in Wuhan, one of the most populous cities in Central China, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified. In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international alarm. In fewer than 10 months, SARS-CoV-2 spread worldwide, killing over 2,300,000 people with more than 149,000,000 confirmed infected cases as of today (https://covid19.who.int) (29 April 2021). The global COVID-19 pandemic crisis was never verified before, creating a massive disruption to lives and livelihoods, as well as to social and economic systems around the world. This virus is highly contagious and spreads steeply everywhere in the world. Young people act as asymptomatic carriers, but older and frail people are more likely to have the most severe form of the disease and higher mortality. The severe form of COVID-19 infection can have profound implications in the short- and in the medium-term, but we postulate there are implications in the long-term, too. Before identification of the present pandemic disease, six other human infectious coronaviruses were identified, and four of them (HCoV-229E, -OC43, -NL63, and -HKU1) still have a high incidence worldwide and are responsible for 15%–30% of cases of upper respiratory tract infections [1]. The last two gave origin to serious epidemic respiratory diseases; SARS was caused by SARS-CoV in 2002–2003, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) by MERS-CoV, which was firstly identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [2,3]. Rare diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) are related to them [4]. For SARS-CoV-2, the incubation period varies from 4 to 11 days [5]. Common symptoms include loss of smell and taste, fever, cough, sore throat, and feeling of malaise. Some gastrointestinal symptoms are also frequent, such as diarrhea, nausea, and anorexia [6]. Risk factors of complications due to the infection from SARS-CoV-2 include an age above 65 years, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity [7,8,9,10,11].",
            "The manifestation of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. About 20% of the hospitalized patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection develop a strong sequelae of serious symptoms requiring intensive care and oxygen supplementation [12]. Hui and coworkers reported characteristic signs of shock in critical COVID-19 patients, including cold extremities, weak peripheral pulses, and severe metabolic acidosis, indicating a possible dysfunction at the microcirculation level [13]. In a recent meta-analysis, neurological damage was evaluated to vary from patient to patient, from the ones with nonspecific symptoms to those with specific symptoms. Some severe symptoms can also become visible in the later stage of the disease [14]. Furthermore, it was recently remarked that, in addition to the symptoms involving the respiratory system, 36.4% of hospitalized patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 have a higher probability to experience neurological symptoms, including headache, altered consciousness, and paresthesia compared to those who have mild/moderate disease [15].",
            "In France, 84% of the patients with COVID-19 showed neurological complications, such as encephalopathy (69%) and signs of the corticospinal tract (67%) [16].",
            "We previously reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause brain damage through both a direct way (the virus directly reaches the brain) and an indirect effect (high systemic inflammation and oxidative stress) [17]. In May 2020, Moriguchi’s group first reported a case of aseptic encephalitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection with the discovery of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid of the patient. This case report was described in a 24-year-old man with seizures followed by unconsciousness [18]. Several published articles suggest that some COVID-19 patients may develop post-acute neurological, cardiovascular, and renal alterations. In a recent study presented by Carfì and collaborators, the authors found out that 87.4% of patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 had persistence of at least one symptom [19].",
            "A recent study of follow-up of adults with non-critical COVID-19 showed that, in the medium-term, two-thirds of patients still reported symptoms at 30 and 60 days, and one third were still sick or in a worse clinical condition at 60 days [20]. Furthermore, the cohort of patients that still presented symptoms after 60 days belonged to the 40–70 age range [20].",
            "Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic requires a careful medical treatment even after its end. It should be noted that the study presented some limitations because it was a single-center study, and only non-critical COVID-19 patients were included.",
            "The paper published by Garrigues and coworkers showed that most patients needing hospitalization for COVID-19 still presented persistent symptoms such as fatigue and dyspnea, even 110 days after discharge. After discharge, the most usual reported symptoms were fatigue (55%), dyspnea (42%), memory loss (34%), sleep disorders such as insomnia, (30.8%), and concentration difficulty (28%). These findings emphasize the need for long-term follow-up of those patients and rehabilitation programs [21,22]. One of the weaknesses of the study is that it was based on the patient’s self-assessment, and for this reason, they could have undergone incomplete recall or recall bias.",
            "From what was said above, it appears that post-acute COVID-19 syndrome is a multisystem disease that can occur even after a relatively mild infection, although these conditions seem to affect mainly COVID-19 patients with more severe forms of the disease. Currently, there is no clear definition of these clinical alterations.",
            "In this review, we discuss some recognized neurological signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We believe that it is necessary to highlight the presence of neurological signs during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, although, thus far, little is known to treat the disease and prevent a worsening of patients’ prognosis. Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 (Figure 1) vary from mild (e.g., loss of taste and smell, cephalgia, dizziness) to severe (e.g., ischemic stroke, encephalitis).",
            "Several studies recently showed that symptoms affecting the nervous system, such as sensory disturbances, headache, nausea, and vomiting, may occur in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and persist after infection [17]. Here, we discuss the different neurobiological processes and mechanisms linking SARS-CoV-2 to neuronal dysfunction.",
            "The potential pathways of SARS-CoV-2 neuro-invasion from the periphery to the brain are many. All these routes are determined by the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2), used by SARS-CoV-2 to bind and penetrate human cells [23]. This receptor is broadly distributed in lungs, heart, liver, kidney, intestine, and oral and nasal mucosa.",
            "The existence of the direct route is hypothesized with the aid of coronavirus-infected animal experiments [24]. Possibly, after the droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 reach the nasal cavity, most viruses head to the lung, while others adhere to the mucosa of the nasal cavity from which they directly attack the olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium; from here, they can be transferred into the CNS through the olfactory nerve. In addition, the abundant capillary blood vessels and lymphatics existent in the nasal mucosa provide chances for virus invasion of the bloodstream, from which they reach the brain. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2, adhering to the nasal mucosa or accessing the eye conjunctiva, may also reach the trigeminal nerve and then the brain through the route used for brain drug delivery [25]. The virus may also infect the sensory neurons in the taste buds, reach the nucleus of the solitary tract (VII, IX, and X) or the trigeminal nerve (V), and enter the CNS through neuronal retrograde transport [23].",
            "Recently, Song and collaborators suggested the direct neuro-invasion of SARS-CoV-2 in the central nervous system in human and mouse brains. They showed that the brain is a site for high SARS-CoV-2 replication, with metabolic changes in neurons (neuronal death) in human brain organoids. Neuronal infection can be excluded by blocking ACE2, with antibodies, or by administering cerebrospinal fluid from a COVID-19 patient. Furthermore, using mice overexpressing human ACE2, the same authors demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 neuro-invasion in vivo. Finally, using COVID-19 brain autopsy of deceased patients, the authors detected SARS-CoV-2 in cortical neurons [26].",
            "Viruses, once entered in the lungs, flow into the bloodstream through ACE2 receptor, present in the epithelium of the respiratory system. Moreover, they can also reach the gastrointestinal tract and then reach the brain through the vasculature system [23]. Once it has entered the bloodstream, the virus can infect the endothelial cells of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) or the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), and then disseminate toward the CNS via ACE2 receptors. Besides, SARS-CoV-2′s cytokine storm in severely affected patients damages the BBB, resulting in infiltration of inflammatory factors and other blood contents, including viral particles, in the CNS [26]. Viruses in the blood can also directly enter the fourth ventricle through a damaged BCSFB.",
            "Spike (S) proteins are essential for the virus to enter into the host cells. These proteins bind to the cellular ACE2 receptor, which is also present in neurons [27,28]. Protein S is the surface glycoprotein of the virus responsible for its crown shape. This protein is composed by two subunits, S1 and S2 [24]. The S1 subunit consists of the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the CTD is responsible for binding to the host cell. The S2 subunit allows the fusion with membranes. Full-length protein S, RBD domain, S1 subunit, and NTD are used as antigens to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, including adenoviral, RNA-based, DNA-based, and protein subunit vaccines [29].",
            "Furthermore, after intravenous injection, radioiodinated S1 (I-S1) protein was shown to cross the BBB in mice, be absorbed by brain regions, and enter the parenchymal brain space. Intranasally administered I-S1 penetrated the brain, but the levels were approximately ten times lower than those observed after intravenous administration. I-S1 intersected the BBB by transcytosis, and ACE2 was involved in the brain uptake [30].",
            "The penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into neurons can alter their cellular processes for energy production and protein folding [29]. Inside the cell, the virus can cause mitochondrial dysfunction and lysosome damage by inducing increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein misfolding/aggregation, and, ultimately, cell death [26]. It is important to underline that all these processes are involved in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [31,32,33]. Moreover, binding of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can reduce the conversion of angiotensin 2 (AT2) to AT [27]. Higher levels of AT2 are associated with pro-inflammatory markers and vascular injury to brain cells and other organs, all processes involved in neurodegeneration [27]. Furthermore, high levels of inflammation (cytokine storm) and BBB lesions in the brain are very likely to have long-term consequences on neurodegeneration. Indeed, there is indication that brain inflammation may contribute to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, PD, and ALS [34]. Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 could remain inside neurons without inducing toxic effects [35]. Therefore, in patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus could theoretically cause brain degeneration decades later [31]. Consequently, it would be useful to follow patients who were affected by COVID-19, allowing one to establish the real relationship between viral infection and neurodegenerative disorders (Figure 2). Finally, a better understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms through which CoVs induced neuronal damage could help in performing new therapeutic strategies.",
            "Viruses stimulate the innate immune cells that recognize the molecular patterns associated with the pathogens. Decrease of the efficiency of the innate immune responses in eliminating the virus leads to the activation of adaptive immune system. The immune cells secrete cytokines and/or chemokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interferon-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP)-1. These molecules promote the influx of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils to the site of infection [36]. Generally, this response is able to eliminate the virus, but occasionally the immune system is dysregulated, which leads to the alteration of the immune homeostasis [37]. SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause an intense inflammatory response, cytokine storm, which promotes lung pathogenesis and respiratory failure. This condition is one of the reasons for the higher mortality rate in fragile populations. As previously described, during COVID-19, the immune system is anomalously involved, and this may exacerbate autoimmunity in genetically predisposed people. Abnormal activation of immunological pathways could trigger mechanisms that alter the molecular recognition between viral epitopes and autoepitopes. Exacerbated immune-mediated manifestations are described in COVID-19 patients and represent the first sign of infection in fragile individuals. In addition, a robust adaptive immune response is essential for a conclusive viral clear and avoiding a re-infection [37].",
            "During severe infection, the SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes in the brain, which are particularly important. This neurotropic virus can stimulate glial cells and induce a pro-inflammatory status [38]. The most important cytokine during COVID-19 is interleukin 6 (IL-6), which is positively correlated with the severity of COVID-2019 symptoms. High levels of proinflammatory cytokines can cause confusion and alteration of consciousness [39]. A high level of inflammation may be associated with thrombophilia and increase the risk of stroke and other thrombotic events. The complementary activation may additionally lead to thrombotic microvascular injury in patients with severe COVID-19 [40]. Mohamud and coworkers reported five events of acute ischemic stroke simultaneous or 14 day delayed in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection [41]. The mechanism of this event can be explained considering that the virus induces a high infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells in the atheromatous plaques present in the blood vessel, exposing the patient to a thrombotic event. This can occur at the level of the carotid arteries [42]. The inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause thinning of their fibrous caps, invasion of lipids, and expansion of the lipid layer [41].",
            "High levels of cytokine and chemokine liberation may additionally lead to brain injury through microglial activation. In fact, in a case report, marked microglial nodules and neuronophagia were found in the brain tissue of a patient with COVID-19 [43].",
            "Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 infection are increasing to date. Ellul and collaborators elucidated the clinical features associated with COVID-19 infection in either central or peripheral nervous systems. Usually, neuropathological manifestations appear at the same time as the viral respiratory infection or some days after. Unfortunately, early reports did not have sufficient details to detect the presence of obvious neurological manifestations [4]. As the pandemic progresses, reports of neurological manifestations are increasing. To date, a multicenter study reported neurological manifestation as follows: three patients with encephalitis, 69 patients with other encephalopathies, and three patients with encephalomyelitis. Information relative to these patients is limited, but three died and, in three patients, neurological symptoms persisted long enough to require rehabilitation. Regarding peripheral nervous system manifestations, the study reports: seven patients with Guillain-Barrè disease diagnosed at the beginning of the viral infection and five patients with other neuropathies including Rhabdomiolysis. Among these patients, three needed rehabilitation, another three reported a longer time in intensive unit, and the rest reported minor or no information [44]. Furthermore, in 34 patients with cerebrovascular disease (ischaemic stroke and attacks), 20 died and six needed rehabilitation [4]. Loss of smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia) emerged as common symptoms of COVID-19 and were present in 357 patients out of 417 in a European study [45] and in 68 out of 259 patients in a French retrospective observation [46]. There was no information on patients with abnormal smell and taste in persistent neurological symptoms. In the study of Varatharaj and colleagues at the beginning of 2020, among 125 patients recruited, the following percentage reported neurological problems: 13% with encephalopathy, 18% with a neuropsychiatric diagnosis (psychosis, neurocognitive syndrome, and an affective disorder), and 62% patients with cerebrovascular events [47]. Table 1 shows the neurological symptoms, the percentage of affected people, and the time of symptom onset.",
            "In a pediatric multicenter neurological study, Lindan and collaborators found that the entire cohort studied did well with COVID-19 infection, whereas all children with hospital-acquired co-infections died, and two children were severely impaired and needed rehabilitation [48].",
            "Although, the percentage of patients needing rehabilitation due to neurological associated COVID-19 manifestation is low, this is certainly due to the lack of follow up description after the hospital period of infection. At the beginning of the pandemic period, several observational studies lacked neurological description, implying that neurological manifestations were not evident. Today, it is quite clear that neurological traits associated with COVID-19 infection can be considered a sequel of the viral infection. Rogers and collaborators in a systematic review and meta-analysis showed how anxiety, fatigue, depression and post-traumatic stress were present in people surviving the COVID-19 infection as long-term manifestation. The etiology of the outcomes of infection with COVID-19 is likely to be multifactorial and might include the direct effects of viral infection (including encephalitis), cerebrovascular disease, physiological impairment (such as hypoxia), immunological activation, social isolation, and psychological impact. Many survivors complain about memory, attention, concentration, or mental impairments even after one year [49]. Eventually, it is quite possible that the psychiatric outcomes could be unrelated to the COVID-19 infection and may rather be a consequence of literature selection bias. At the same time, literature reporting post-illness studies did not agree on follow-up times and the studies cannot be compared. Therefore, thus far, there are too few studies for drawing conclusions but there is enough information to hypothesize that, in select populations, COVID-19 infection might drive neurological and psychiatric drawbacks.",
            "There are not specific brain treatments for COVID-19 neurological effects. However, the German Society of Neurology published the first neurological manifestation guideline for the care of patients with neurological disease with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, an abbreviated version of the guideline was published [50].",
            "Health care systems are currently focused on managing COVID-19 and its consequences on human health. The severity of the illness is related to advanced age, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, and patients with immunodeficiency [51]. The initial personal visit should target the establishment of a patient’s baseline after SARS-CoV-2 infection. This procedure would require a deep investigation of present and past medical, social, and family history, physical examination, and blood testing. Once the COVID-19 post infection baseline is established, a follow-up evaluation during a visit should aim for a better understanding of the natural course of the disease and identify earlier new abnormalities. During the first 12 months of follow-up, clinical visit could be accompanied by some additional evaluations, such as SARS-CoV-2 infectivity testing lung analyses, 6 minute walk tests, quality of life monitoring, fatigue, and general blood tests.",
            "It is now evident that this infection does not only involve the respiratory system but has consequences that affect cardiovascular, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems as well as other organs [52,53,54,55]. Furthermore, patients who stay longer in the intensive care unit may also develop a post-intensive care syndrome with anxiety, depression, or other neurological disorders. In addition to paying attention to the respiratory syndrome, it is necessary to evaluate and treat the after-effects derived from a condition with prolonged bed rest and invasive mechanical ventilation. The rehabilitation of patients after COVID-19 infection cannot be separated from medical assistance focused to the treatment of respiratory, neurological, and post-infectious pathologies [56]. Therefore, the rehabilitation program requires a multidisciplinary approach that responds in a highly specific way to the needs of the individual. The rehabilitation treatment concerns two fundamental aspects: (a) respiratory function [57] and (b) physical re-education of peripheral muscle function and increase of exercise capacity [58]. The first rehabilitation event is to re-educate the patient to postural passages in bed from supine decubitus to lateral decubitus (rolling activity). The positioning of the posture should be chosen based on thoracic/CT ultrasound, auscultation, and SpO2 [58]. The pulmonary rehabilitation program, physical exercise and aerobic training, was reconfirmed as a fundamental moment in the management of COVID-19 patients, together with neuromotor rehabilitation techniques and rehabilitation activities for peripheral muscles, strength, static and dynamic balance, and walking to improve autonomy and quality of life and the reintegration of the individual into society.",
            "Despite the fact that neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are not yet fully investigated, some patients after a severe infection, frail people in particular, have CNS involvement for a long time [59]. A precise and targeted study of neurological symptoms can clarify the role played by the virus in causing prolonged neurological manifestations. It is essential to better define the characteristics of post-acute COVID-19 neurological syndrome to identify methods of intervention.",

            "COVID-19, initially regarded as specific lung disease, exhibits an extremely broad spectrum of symptoms. Extrapulmonary manifestations of the disease also include important neuropsychiatric symptoms with atypical characteristics. Are these disturbances linked to stress accompanying every systemic infection, or are due to specific neurobiological changes associated with COVID-19? Evidence accumulated so far indicates that the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is characterized by systemic inflammation, hypoxia resulting from respiratory failure, and neuroinflammation (either due to viral neurotropism or in response to cytokine storm), all affecting the brain. It is reasonable to hypothesize that all these events may initiate or worsen psychiatric and cognitive disorders. Damage to the brain triggers a specific type of reactive response mounted by neuroglia cells, in particular by astrocytes which are the homeostatic cell par excellence. Astrocytes undergo complex morphological, biochemical, and functional remodeling aimed at mobilizing the regenerative potential of the central nervous system. If the brain is not directly damaged, resolution of systemic pathology usually results in restoration of the physiological homeostatic status of neuroglial cells. The completeness and dynamics of this process in pathological conditions remain largely unknown. In a subset of patients, glial cells could fail to recover after infection thus promoting the onset and progression of COVID-19-related neuropsychiatric diseases. There is evidence from post-mortem examinations of the brains of COVID-19 patients of alterations in both astrocytes and microglia. In conclusion, COVID-19 activates a huge reactive response of glial cells, that physiologically act as the main controller of the inflammatory, protective and regenerative events. However, in some patients the restoration of glial physiological state does not occur, thus compromising glial function and ultimately resulting in homeostatic failure underlying a set of specific neuropsychiatric symptoms related to COVID-19.",
            "Open access funding provided by Università degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.",
            "Astroglia control such a huge number of functions that they can be considered to take part in any circumstance in which there is a disturbance of cerebral homeostasis. In fact, following any brain insults, these cells become reactive by profoundly modifying their morphology and functions. This complex response is part of the homeostatic tasks that glial cells perform physiologically and has as its objective the containment of the damage and the return to a homeostatic condition. However, glia changes are not always restored in a timely manner thus causing brain damage. At the beginning of 2021, we hypothesized that the neuropsychiatric consequences of COVID-19 are maladaptive glial recovery to blame [1, 2]. This hypothesis is now reinforced by growing evidence which is summarized in the following paragraphs.",
            "Glial cells are heterogeneous neural cells exerting a plethora of functions mainly aimed at preserving the central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Glial cells are usually classified into microglia and macroglia. This latter includes astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursors, also known as NG-2 glia or synantocytes [3, 4]. Microglia are of myeloid origin; their precursors migrate into the neural tube early in development. Microglial cells undergo profound metamorphosis acquiring specific 'neural'-like morphology and expressing numerous receptors for neurotransmitters and neurohormones [5]. Microglial cells contribute to CNS physiology and are mounting CNS defence in pathology being the main immunocompetent cells of the nervous tissue. Microglia scan the tissue and modify their morphology and functions if and when necessary [6]. Microglia are crucial for the formation, shaping, and functioning of synapses [7, 8], fundamental for brain development during pre- and post-natal periods. Erratic execution of synaptic elimination by microglia during early post-natal life is associated with anomalous functional connectivity, hippocampal long-term potentiation impairment, and aberrant behaviours [9, 10]. Microglia activate phagocytosis to incorporate waste products, cellular debris, and pathogens. They could react to pro-inflammatory stimuli by releasing cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species [11].",
            "Oligodendrocytes are macroglial cells chiefly responsible for the formation of the myelin sheath around axons, thus being a fundamental element of the brain connectome [12]. Oligodendrocytes also support axons through cytoplasmic-rich myelinic channels that allow bidirectional movement of macromolecules under the myelin sheath [12–14]. Oligodendrocytes originate from precursor cells mainly localized in the ventricular zones of the brain, from which they migrate to colonise the developing CNS and became mature cells. This process starts shortly before birth and continues lifelong. The maturation of oligodendrocytes is usually accelerated in case of CSN injury, aging, or brain diseases, in order to replace the lost myelin [15]. Functions of oligodendrocyte precursors, also known as NG-2 glia, remain to be fully characterised. These cells express several receptors and ion channels, their receive synaptic contacts and may contribute to homeostatic control of the nervous tissue. Since NG-2 glia can differentiate into oligodendrocytes, they play a role in myelination and brain plasticity [16, 17].",
            "Astroglia are fundamental for the maintenance of CNS homeostasis at molecular, cellular, organ, and system levels of organization [18, 19]. Several morphologically and functionally distinct subtypes of astroglial cells have been identified (e.g., protoplasmic and fibrous astrocytes of the grey matter, velate astrocytes of the cerebellum and olfactory bulb, radial astrocytes, perivascular and marginal astrocytes, ependymocytes, and many others) [19]. Astrocytes form the parenchymal part of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), which controls the exchanges of molecules and fluids between the brain and the periphery as well as restricts pathogens and cells brain invasion [18, 20–22]. Astrocytes regulate interstitial pH, control the concentration of extracellular ions, and scavenge reactive oxygen species [19]. Astrocytes are the central part of neuro-vascular unit, and they are involved in the regulation of local hyperaemia through the release of vasoactive molecules [23, 24]. Astrocytes are a part of the gliocrine system secreting about 200 molecules, including neurotrophic and synaptogenic factors as well as providing energy support to other neural cells [25]. Finally, astrocytes are fundamental components of the glymphatic system responsible for cleansing the nervous tissue [26]. Through morphological contact with synapses, astrocytes form the 'synaptic cradle', regulating all aspects of synaptic functions from synaptogenesis to synaptic maintenance and extinction [27]. In particular, astrocytes are indispensable for the control of neurotransmitter homeostasis in the brain [18, 28]. Astrocytes control so many cerebral functions that they are considered the homeostatic cells par excellence. As a consequence, any changes in the physiological performance of astrocytes may have a role in the etiology or progression of neurological pathologies.",
            "Any insult to the CNS, including invasion of pathogens, triggers glial response, known as reactive astrogliosis [29]. Reactive glia play a fundamental defensive role, starting a series of responses aimed at restoring the lost homeostasis. Peripheral proinflammatory cytokines may induce microgliosis and astrogliosis whenever a CNS insult occurs, including viral infections [30]. Whenever glial cells lose their homeostatic activities, neuronal cells suffer. If the alteration of glial cells persists the irreversible damage to the nervous tissue may occur [3, 31–34].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19 emerged from China in 2019. The virus spread rapidly through the world triggering the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded β-coronavirus belonging to the family of Coronaviridae, the largest group of viruses causing respiratory and gastrointestinal infections [35, 36]. Historically, coronaviruses received little attention due to their scant effects on humans. This changed in 2002 when atypical pneumonia spread from the Guangdong province to more than twenty countries. This illness was named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the identified etiological β-coronavirus was named SARS-CoV [37]. Although COVID-19 seems to have a lower case-fatality rate than SARS (about 2.3% versus about 6.4%, respectively [38]), the massive spread of the infection has claimed over 6.3 million casualties worldwide (WHO web-dashboard data updated on June 29th, 2022). The majority of the infected people appear to have eliminated the coronavirus from their bodies after a few weeks and resume normal activity. However, about the 40% of infected people experience a variety of symptoms (loss of smell and/or taste, fatigue, cough, aching pain, \"brain fog,\" insomnia, shortness of breath, and tachycardia) after several weeks and are diagnosed with the so-called long COVID syndrome.",
            "To invade cells the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor which undergoes proteolytic processing by the transmembrane protease serine 2 [39–41]. In addition, both basigin (also known as CD147) and neuropilin-1 were identified as docking receptors for the SARS-CoV-2 virus [42–44]. After the first signs of the illness, the patient experiences a short recovery time, in which symptoms attenuate, usually followed by a more severe symptomatic. The human immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 should develop in two phases. The constitutive adaptive immune response is activated at the beginning of the disease fighting the virus that actively replicates to colonise and damage the cells of the affected tissues, mostly lungs [38, 45]. A second phase, that take place in severe cases of COVID-19, defined as a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is characterised by the so-called “cytokine storm” that is due to the hyperactivation of the immune system, accompanied by a massive release of proinflammatory mediators, cytokines, and chemokines [46, 47]. The hyperactive immune response impacts upon many organs and systems, underlying the multi-organ pathology observed in COVID-19 patients [48]. Thus, the cytokine load has also become the major hallmark in COVID-19 patients [49]. Growing clinical data suggest that patients having pre-existing conditions, such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, dyslipidemia, have a higher risk of developing severe or fatal COVID-19 [50–52].",
            "Extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 including neurological symptomatology, primarily anosmia and ageusia, are frequently reported [53–55]. Neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients are grossly underestimated, especially because many severely ill patients are sedated and on ventilators [56]. However, cases of encephalitis, strokes, confusion, seizures, and brain inflammation have been reported [57–59]. A retrospective clinical study has provided evidence for substantial incidence of neurological and psychiatric events in patients during the first 6 months after getting COVID-19. The risk for neurological and psychiatric sequelae seems to be greatest in patients who had severe COVID-19 [60]. Cognitive deficits and depression have been seen in patients that recovered from mild COVID-19 [61].",
            "The capability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter the CNS has been suggested by analogy with the neurotropism of other members of group 2 of the β-coronavirus family [62–67], to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs. Among several suggested routes of entry, the most studied and acknowledged is binding to ACE2 which is expressed in the CNS, mostly by endothelial cells [68] but also by both neurones and glial cells [69–71]. SARS-CoV-2 engages ACE2 as the entry receptor and employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike protein S cleavage [41]. This activates virus endocytosis controlled by endosomal proton pump and NAADP-sensitive intracellular two-pore channel 2 [72]. The ACE2 is expressed in the brain stem [69, 70], populating highly vascularised brain structures lacking the BBB like the circumventricular organs, the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, paraventricular nucleus, and rostral ventrolateral medulla [73]. Such distribution makes these regions more vulnerable to peripheral neurotoxic molecules or invasive agents, like SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Another proposed route for viral entry to the brain is the invasion and consequent lesion of the olfactory system, which is consistent with the clinical data reporting that infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with high rates of disturbances in smell and taste perception, including anosmia [74–78]. Recently the cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules have been identified. Single-cell sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells, rather than in neurons [79]. Through the olfactory system, the virus could spread into the brain stem, possibly compromising the respiratory centres [80]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigations seem to corroborate that virus may enter the brain through the trans-nasal route [81–84], however, further studies are needed to better define their neuroradiologic interpretation.",
            "Alternatively, the SARS-CoV-2 could penetrate through the median eminence, whose capillaries and tanycytes are thought to express ACE2, reaching the hypothalamus [85], and from there it could spread to the entire brain.",
            "Brain infiltration of immune cells carrying the virus (a viral reservoir [86]) may represent another route of the virus entry. Vessels, meninges, and the choroid plexus have been proposed as entry points for infected monocytes, neutrophils, and T cells. However, conclusive evidence of infection through these routes has yet to be provided [87]. As suggested by some authors, some neurological symptoms and damage are the result of the body’s own immune system overreacting after encountering the virus. Some subjects inadvertently make ‘autoantibodies’ that attack their own tissue [88]. These autoantibodies can pass via the BBB, and contribute to both short- and long-term conditions, including neurological disorders ranging from brain fog to psychosis.",
            "Evidence has also accumulated that the virus SARS-CoV-2 can affect the brain by reducing blood flow to it. In this way, SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs neurons function and ultimately killing them. Lastly, a leaky or dysfunctional BBB could facilitate the entry of the virus, as in other kinds of infections. For instance, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 downregulates the expression of tight junction proteins, compromising BBB integrity [89]. Numerous studies highlight that systemic inflammation could damage glia limitans and damage the BBB [90]. Thus, the hyperreactive immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 may compromise the integrity of the BBB. Severe COVID-19 is often associated with comorbidities, such as CNS hypoxia due to respiratory failure, thrombotic microangiopathy, or pre-existing neurological diseases, which all may increase BBB permeability facilitating the entry of the virus into the brain [91]. The reported presence of SARS-CoV-2 in patients cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue suggests that once in the body the virus can reach the brain [92–94]. This is also true for SARS-CoV-1 [65, 66].Finally, the observation in post-mortem brain tissues of SARS-CoV-2 signal not coinciding with immune cell infiltration suggests that virus-related neurological complications could be the direct consequence of the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 [95, 96].",
            "Typically, whenever any virus enters the CNS, the innate immune response activates. Both immune and neural cells participate in this process, cooperating in removing the pathogen. Astrocytes control the communication between resident and infiltrating immune cells and regulate the effector functions of antiviral T and B cells in the CNS compartments [97, 98]. Astrocytes respond quickly to brain insults, viruses including, by virtue of their functions of monitoring and preserving the brain homeostasis. In response to brain insults, astrocytes initiate the programme of reactive astrogliosis generally characterised by increased levels of the intermediate filament proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, and nestin, as well as by hypertrophy of astrocytic processes, although in some cases atrophy has been documented too. In specific conditions, such as acute trauma, astrocytes may proliferate, regulate scar formation by fibroblasts and form new barriers around lesioned foci [29, 31, 99]. Reactive astrocytes are generally neuroprotective because they amplify homoeostatic cascades, detect and remove toxic substances and promote regeneration. At the same time, during viral infections, astrocytes and microglia may also become long-term virus reservoirs in the absence of efficient innate immune-mediated clearing mechanisms [100]. Viruses-induced rise in interleukin(IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-α may cause changes in the metabolic phenotype of astrocytes, resulting in reduced glycogen storage and lactate transport, fundamental for energy support for neurons [97, 101]. In HIV-1 infection, astroglia release cytokines and chemokines able to reduce viral replication. Concurrently, when HIV infects astrocytes, it impairs their functions by forcing them to produce viral proteins, thus causing neuronal damage [102–105]. Furthermore, HIV-1 infected astrocytes release membrane HIV-1 Tat protein triggering mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death [106]. Proinflammatory cytokines secreted by microglial cells may promote astrogliosis whenever a CNS insult occurs, including viral infections [30, 107]. Astrogliosis and microgliosis could lead both of the cell types to gain aberrant functions or lose fundamental ones, resulting in neuronal damage [29, 108].",
            "Murine coronavirus, MHV-A59, could infect the brain and its CNS effects were mediated by the cytokine release from reactive microglia and astrocytes. The authors documented that the cytokines released from both cell types were complementary, resulting in elevated levels of IL-1β, IL-6, interferon(INF)s, and TNF-α. Of note, they did not detect the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 [109]. In a SARS-CoV-1 patient, necrosis of neurons, broad hyperplasia of glial cells, and encephalic oedema have been reported. High plasma level of the chemokine Mig, a monokine induced by the INF-γ, that promotes the host defence by attracting activated T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and CXCR3 expressing monocytes [66] has also been detected. Several studies indicated that SARS-CoV-2 affects astrocytes. A recent post-mortem investigation demonstrated that astrocytes are the main sites of viral infection within the CNS and that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells exhibit marked metabolic changes [110]. These authors suggest that astrocyte functions are impaired since they detected a reduction of the metabolites used to fuel neurons and produce neurotransmitters. In cortical tissue cultures and cortical organoids exposed to SARS-CoV-2, it has recently been demonstrated significant infection and viral replication in astrocytes, but minimal infection in other cell types [111].The same group reported that infected astrocytes had a corresponding increase in reactivity characteristics, growth factor signaling, and cellular stress. Signs of astrocyte reactivity have long been proposed in COVID-19 patients. For instance, elevated GFAP was found in the white matter of a COVID-19 patient, with encephalomyelitis-like brain damage, oligodendrocytic apoptosis and axonal injuries [112]. Plasma levels of both GFAP and neurofilament light chain protein (NfL), a biomarker predictive of intra-axonal neuronal injury, were measured in 47 patients with mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 and matched controls. GFAP was found elevated in moderate/severe stages of the disease. This suggests that astrogliosis could be an early response after SARS-CoV-2 infection of the CNS [113]. In COVID-19-related acute necrotising encephalopathy virus was detected in the CSF, together with extremely high levels of NfL and GFAP, 19 days after the onset of the symptoms and even after testing negative twice [94]. These clinical studies indicate that astrocytes could be in a reactive state in COVID-19 patients. Consistently, the damage of the BBB and the strong lymphopenia observed during COVID-19 could promote the persistence of the virus, thus sustaining neuroinflammation and reactive gliosis. The resulting brain tissue alteration could explain some of the clinical features observed in COVID-19 patients who, despite overcome pneumonia, present cognitive impairment associated with behavioural changes [2, 114–117].",
            "CNS viral infections induce cognitive, mood, and motor deficits that may persist beyond the acute phase of the disease. In many cases, CNS sequelae may be provoked by irreversible damage to both neurons and glia triggered by pathogens [118]. Otherwise, infection-driven neuroinflammation can disturb brain homeostasis and circuit functioning inducing long-term deficits resulting in behavior alterations [119]. In this context, focusing on the neuropsychiatric sequelae that emerged following the SARS -COV 2 infection, longitudinal epidemiology research has revealed a broad spectrum of long-term consequences in patients who survived to COVID-19 pandemic, providing evidence that almost 80% of subjects discharged from hospital complained at least one of the following symptoms including fatigue, muscle weakness, myalgia, dizziness, headache sleep disturbances, brain fog, cognitive impairment, depression or anxiety in addition to cardiopulmonary manifestations [120–122]. Inevitably, the frequent persistence of this condition up to six months and beyond together with the failure of any effective treatment has a considerable impact on the quality of life of the affected subjects, keeping them out of work and social life [123]. Evidence that COVID-19 is followed by a significant rate of neuropsychiatric diagnoses over the subsequent six months has been further confirmed by a robust retrospective cohort study [117]. On the basis of this data, particular interest was drawn from the persistence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in convalescent patients or from their late appearance in subjects completely restored by the viral infection [60, 124, 125]. This should not be surprising, as similar features with significant neurological and mental complains were already reported in acute or post-disease phases during other previous coronavirus outbreaks. The experience gained with neurological and psychiatric manifestations of MERS and SARS would provide the right framework for better exploring CNS complications occurring during SARS-CoV-2 infection [126]. Post-COVID-19 psychiatric pathology frequently begins with a fatiguing feeling of asthenia, with a sense of apathy resulting in a condition of reduced interest in interpersonal relationships, and a decreased pleasure in carrying out those occupations that were previously a source of satisfaction. The appearance of sleep–wake rhythm disturbances and a progressive decrease in mood testify to the onset of an overt depression [127]. Depression following pandemics is considered one of the most significant public health concerns. A recent study reported a long-term prevalence beyond twelve months of 18.3% [120], while another investigation on the same topic suggested an overall depression prevalence of 27.9% [128]. According to some authors, the depression observed in the condition defined as long COVID appears to be characterized by manifestations that distinguish it from the canonical major depressive disorder [119]. Highlights of post-COVID-19 depression include a higher incidence of psychotic traits, marked motor agitation, evident neurocognitive deterioration, and profound changes in the sleep–wake rhythm. Psychotic anomalies, consisting in delusions, hallucinations, thoughts, disorganized may initially appear at the height of the COVID-19 pathology, and may also persist when the delirium is over and the infection is resolved. Psychotic manifestations many times emerge weeks or months after healing from the infection, not accompanied by delirium or confusion, mimicking the onset of a primary psychotic episode. Sleep disorders frequently complicate the clinical picture of long COVID-19 and are characterized by marked difficulty in initiating sleep rather than keeping it uninterrupted [129]. These sleep disturbances frequently occur in the younger population experiencing COVID-19 if even asymptomatic, without significant anxiety levels about the outcome and consequences of the infection. Sometimes insomnia remains even beyond the disappearance of the other disorders that had characterized the long COVID-19, in the absence of a manifest anxiety and an overt decline in mood, therefore leaving insomnia without a clear explanation [2, 129, 130]. A recent report by Jahrami et al. assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence and severity of sleep problems among patients with COVID-19 indicated a high frequency of disturbed sleep, with an average rate of 74.8% [131]. Such an important incidence of sleep disturbances in patients who recovered from the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection could be explained by the interaction between sleep impairment and immune system dysfunction [132]. In fact, sleep and the immune system, according to researchers, interact bidirectionally. This hypothesis is supported by altered sleep patterns during viral infections with the release of inflammatory molecules, particularly in the acute phase of the immune response and the development of recovery during sickness [133]. The response of the immune system to infection, with the subsequent release of these immunological mediators, results in the activation of glial cells which consequently lose their modulatory role in the sleep homeostasis [134]. Moreover, at the level of mental disorders, there is a priori reason to expect that at least a substantial proportion of patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) would experience a worsening of their disturbances due to the pandemic, with contamination/washing symptoms being the most susceptible [135]. Indeed, stressful life events may precipitate or predispose individuals to the development of OCD symptoms. The intense focus on the potential danger of contamination, as well as the COVID 19 infection, may induce the onset of OCD manifestations in vulnerable subjects, even after months of healing from the disease [136]. Currently, except for epidemiological findings, there are no studies specifically aimed at establishing whether and how COVID-19 infection itself could lead to de novo OCD symptoms or exacerbation of symptoms in people with OCD. In this regard, it is important to take into account the stressful effects of the pandemic, but also it is crucial to consider that infective and/or inflammatory processes have been implicated in some cases of OCD-like symptoms [137], with the evidence of a glial activation occurring in the neurocircuits of OCD [138]. Similarly, de novo appearance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) spectrum symptoms or their worsening in people who experienced COVID 19 infection is not surprising since the links between inflammation, immune system alterations, and stress-related diseases have been widely demonstrated [139].",
            "Therefore, the risk of increased prevalence of PTSD has also been observed in previous coronavirus pandemics, making its occurrence during this COVID-19 pandemic highly explainable. Some severe cases of COVID-19 result in mortality. The fear of death might be among the many reasons responsible for PTSD amongst these patients. It has been demonstrated that 16% of the severe COVID-19 patients globally had PTSD [140].",
            "A meta-analysis of the survivors among emergency-admitted patients with SARS and MERS infection has revealed that about 39% of them had suffered from PTSD. A history of psychiatric disorders, especially anxiety and depressive disorders, was found as a risk factor for PTSD in intensive care unit survivors. Twelve months after infection, psychiatric symptoms among COVID-19 recovered survivors were reported as 18.3% for depression, 17.9% for PTSD, 16.2% for anxiety, and 13.5% for sleep disturbance [120].",
            "Based on the above reported findings it is possible to state that psychiatric involvement is not uncommon and can lead to severe problems if not detected and managed early. It is recommended that clinicians should be vigilant regarding psychiatric involvement in post COVID-19 patients. Neuroinflammation, blood–brain barrier disruption, thrombotic events, peripheral immune cell invasion into the CNS, glial activation, brain homeostasis impairment, all represent interaction pathways between immune systems and psychopathological mechanisms underpinning such disorders (Fig. 1). In support of this, a recent analysis of brain images taken before and after infection with SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that even mild COVID-19 is associated with brain structure alterations and brain functioning impairments, suggesting that the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS need to be very seriously considered [141].Fig. 1Putative mechanisms implicated in the neurological manifestations of COVID-19",
            "Putative mechanisms implicated in the neurological manifestations of COVID-19",
            "Although evidence suggests that the virus can enter the brain, it seems, however, to predominantly infect vascular and immune cells. In response to immune over activation (and/or virus direct invasion) astrocytes and microglia become reactive. Also, hemorrhages, microvascular infarcts, and thrombotic events are probably critical in the development of the neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "COVID-19, initially regarded as specific lung disease, impacts many other organs, affecting their function. Several underlying medical conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 have been identified [142]. Evidence accumulated in the past two years indicates that the brain functions and structure are also damaged by the virus. SARS-CoV-2 infection can indeed cause confusion, memory loss, strokes, psychosis, seizures, and other neurological manifestations. There is also evidence of brain-related abnormalities in COVID-19 patients [141] that may explain the neurological manifestations observed. A study revealed that neurological symptoms appeared in 80% of the people hospitalized with COVID-19 who were surveyed [143]. This depicts a dramatic scenario.",
            "How COVID-19 injuries the brain is becoming clearer. New evidence indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 assault on the brain could be multipronged. The coronavirus might target specific brain cells directly, reduce cerebral blood flow, or trigger the production of immune molecules that can harm brain cells. Astrocytes, tanycytes, infiltrating immune cells, and autoantibodies are probably not the only players in the brain response to the coronavirus leading to the observed neuropsychiatric consequences. Researchers are trying to understand how many brain cells (and what kind of cells) need to be either infected or damaged to cause neurological symptoms. Unfortunately, there isn’t a simple answer. Cerebral cells, including neurons, in some regions of the brain will cause more dysfunction than others, if damaged. This opens a new and never explored field of research. Lastly, whether cerebral effects can be partially reversed, or whether these effects will persist in the long term, remains to be investigated.",

            "There is growing recognition that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to both acute and long-term neurological sequelae [1]. In addition to the neurological consequences of severe illness in itself, proposed mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological complications include direct neuroinvasion, and indirect mechanisms, of vascular and inflammatory/autoimmune origin (Fig. 1). The identification and diagnosis of these neurological complications are challenging, particularly in the context of overstrained medical systems, where an under-recognition of neurological manifestations may contribute to an increase in acute and long-term complications and poor outcomes. In addition, there is a high incidence of general critical care complications, for example, hypoxia, metabolic derangements, general inflammation, and drug toxicity/side effects, which can make proper attribution to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) difficult. We discuss the neurological complications associated with COVID-19 (NeuroCOVID) for general intensivists with an emphasis on key symptoms and signs to look for which may change management and/or provide a potential avenue for targeted therapies to improve outcomes.Fig. 1Schematic of potential mechanisms and complications of NeuroCOVID. Direct infection and replication via transsynaptic spread of peripheral and cranial nerves (e.g. vagal or olfactory nerves) or blood–brain barrier dysfunction may lead to the clinical syndromes of encephalitis, myelitis and meningitis (S1). However, given that detection of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) or intrathecal antibodies is rare, direct neuroinvasion is likely to account for only a minority of cases (S2). Neuroinflammation with entry to the CNS of cytokines is thought to occur (S1). Autoimmune neurological syndromes including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, myelitis, and Guillain–Barre Syndrome have also been reported (S3). Endotheliopathy and/or hypercoagulability have been implicated in the pathogenesis of stroke secondary to COVID019 (S4, S5). PTSD post traumatic stress disorder. Image created with BioRender.com.

            "In an early case series from Wuhan > 45% of COVID-19 patients had neurological symptoms that involved both the central nervous system (i.e. anosmia/ageusia, altered mental status, stroke, and seizure) and the peripheral nervous system (i.e. muscle/nerve disease) (Supplementary Table 1) [2]. Subsequent multicentre studies revealed that encephalopathy (31–42%) and stroke syndromes (36–62%) account for most of the COVID-19-associated neurological complications, with inflammatory syndromes, i.e. encephalitis (5–13%) and Guillain-Barré (5–9%) much less frequent [3, 4]. The overall incidence of ischemic stroke is relatively high. It tends to occur in younger patients, with more frequent large vessel occlusion and higher mortality than described in patients without COVID-19[5] and those with influenza [6]. Of the common sequelae, stroke and inflammatory syndromes seem to have the worst outcomes.",
            "Delirium and coma are diagnosed in more than 50% and 80% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19, respectively. Notably, a high exposure to sedatives, mainly benzodiazepines has been independently associated with higher rates of delirium [7]. After cessation of sedatives, patients with severe respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 may have a prolonged period of unconsciousness which may be weeks before complete recovery [8]. Caution is therefore advised when prognosticating in these patients.",
            "Abnormalities detected on neuroimaging in patients with COVID-19 who require critical care are described in Supplementary Table 2. The most common findings include leukoencephalopathy, ischemia/infarction with patterns of large vessel occlusion, leptomeningeal enhancement, encephalitis, haemorrhage in locations not typical for hypertension (lobar and/or cortical; which raises the question of whether it is secondary to anticoagulation), and perfusion abnormalities.",
            "Microhaemorrhages are a frequent finding on susceptibility-weighted imaging. They are particularly located in callosal and juxtacortical regions in a distribution distinct from other causes of similar lesions, including traumatic brain injury. Such microhaemorrhages have also been described in critically ill ventilated patients who do not have COVID-19, and it is unclear whether these may be secondary to COVID-19 itself or a complication of being critically ill with prolonged respiratory failure and hypoxemia [9]. For both microhaemorrhages and leukoencephalopathy, an association with microvascular disease has been described in post mortem studies of patients with COVID-19 [10]. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using diffusion tensor imaging has found abnormalities consistent with widespread oedema, including in crucial brainstem arousal nuclei in patients with persistent unresponsiveness [11]. These findings provide a potential explanation of prolonged altered sensorium and mental status in patients with COVID-19.",
            "There is a growing number of studies confirming that neuroprotective measures should be maintained in patients with COVID-19. In one retrospective study, measurement using ultrasound of the Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter (ONSD) found that 19% of patients potentially had raised intracranial pressure, which was associated with a longer stay in ICU [12]. Electroencephalogram recordings obtained in critically ill patients also tend to be consistent with encephalopathy rather than non-convulsive status epilepticus and may suggest COVID-19 related brain injury [13].",
            "Neurointensive care management during the first COVID-19 waves has required adaptations to existing protocols for common neurological emergencies, including stroke, status epilepticus, neuroprotective strategies, venothromboembolism prophylaxis, and delirium management. Multimodal evaluation (MRI, cerebral spinal fluid analysis and electroencephalography) of COVID-19 patients with persistent encephalopathy allowed identification of rare cases of COVID-19 associated encephalitis, mainly of immune-mediated origin (including brainstem or limbic encephalitis, and acute disseminated encephalitis). For those with likely neuroinflammatory syndromes, there is a need for careful consideration of therapy, as cases of steroid-responsive encephalitis have been described [14]. In such patients, a combination of high-dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins or plasma exchange may be considered.",
            "Many survivors of critical illness develop post intensive care syndrome (PICS) which may cause cognitive, mental health, and physical impairments, with significant impacts on function and quality of life (Supplementary Fig. 1). The effects of this may be further compounded by post acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), and so the rehabilitation needs of these patients may be significant [15]. Critical care recovery clinics with in-person and telehealth options have become valuable resources for ICU survivors and their families. The impact of COVID-19 centres with multidisciplinary services to address the ongoing medical and rehabilitation needs of COVID-19 survivors needs to be studied to guide hospitals and health systems in planning and preparing resources for millions of survivors. Unsurprisingly, given the trauma of a critical care admission, and the added stresses of the pandemic including a lack of family visits in many hospital systems, there is a high prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms [15].",
            "There is a need to monitor patients with COVID-19 for neurological complications, at the acute phase and in the long term. In addition, those with a prolonged course of recovery will place additional burdens on overstretched systems. Ongoing studies will help identify patients at higher risk of developing neurological complications, streamline neuromonitoring strategies and guide management despite limitations on resources. Global collaboration and harmonization of such efforts will be important to facilitate rapid understanding of how best to manage the neurological complications of COVID-19, and so optimize outcomes.",

            "A great number of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) experience olfactory dysfunction, typically of a short duration and with a high incidence rate, during the early stages of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This kind of olfactory dysfunction appears more likely in young people and women. This study presents a review of the clinical features and pathogenic mechanism of the olfactory dysfunction related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, aiming to provide a clinical reference for the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.",
            "Research shows that binding of the spike proteins located on the surface of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to functional angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the surfaces of host cells facilitates virus entry, replication, assembly, and the subsequent infection of other cells (1). The distribution of ACE2 receptors is organ-specific. Besides their high expression in lung tissues, they are also expressed in many extrapulmonary organs, such as nasal mucosa. Waradon et al. found that ACE2 receptors are expressed at a high level in nasal epithelial cells, peculiarly in goblet and ciliated cells, via single-cell transcriptome analysis (2). Therefore, although patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) normally experience symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath as the first symptoms of infection, studies have also indicated that a portion of COVID-19 patients show symptoms of the ear, nose, and throat (ENT), such as olfactory dysfunction, nasal obstruction, runny nose, sore throat, and sore ears, and that these are sometimes the only visible symptoms in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.",
            "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the public, medical personnel, and researchers generally focused on the known signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as fever of an unknown cause, lung infection, and ground-glass opacities on X-ray imaging, while ENT symptoms were ignored. However, with the accumulation of clinical cases and continued investigation, a clear correlation between COVID-19 and ENT symptoms has gradually emerged. It has also been reported successively that COVID-19 may cause nervous functional disorders, including hyposmia and anosmia, in patients.",
            "At present, control of the COVID-19 pandemic remains inadequate. Focusing on COVID-19, this article reviews studies on the correlation between COVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction, compares and analyzes the similarities and differences between olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and olfactory dysfunction caused by other viral infections, and discusses possible mechanisms to provide a theoretical reference for the early screening and diagnosis of COVID-19, as well as the identification and treatment of olfactory dysfunction.",
            "When the odorant molecule is combined with the olfactory receptors of the cilium epithelium of the olfactory nerve, the olfactory nerve is activated and releases transmitters to generate nerve impulses. In this way, the nerve signal is transmitted along the olfactory nerve to the olfactory bulb, and then through the olfactory bulb to the higher olfactory center to stimulate the olfactory cortex, finally producing olfaction. As such, olfactory dysfunction refers to partial or total hyposmia or anosmia.",
            "There are a number of factors that cause olfactory dysfunction, however, the most common is an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) of viral origin. More than 200 kinds of viruses are known to be able to cause URTIs, with rhinoviruses (RVs), coronaviruses (CoVs), influenza viruses (IVs), and para-influenza viruses (PIVs) being the common culprits. Suzuki et al. clinically analyzed nasal discharge of patients with olfactory dysfunction secondary to URTIs and identified the viruses in them, confirming that RVs, CoVs, PIVs, and the Epstein–Barr virus can be causes of olfactory dysfunction (3).",
            "Although, compared to reports of other common symptoms of URTIs, reports of olfactory dysfunction are limited in the COVID-19, and more and more studies have focused on the olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These reports indicate that there may be differences in the incidence, onset time, duration, and mechanism of the olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 and that caused by other common URTI pathogens.",
            "Since SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China at the end of 2019, there have been a number of reports that a portion of COVID-19 patients experience olfactory dysfunction. Elibol conducted a retrospective study to collect patients' medical history and symptoms, among which symptoms of the head and neck, including anosmia and/or ageusia, sore throat, cough, nasal congestion, earache, tinnitus, hearing loss, oral problems, dizziness, hoarseness, and other symptoms, were chief. Of the 155 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 89 (57.4%) were found to have otolaryngological symptoms, including 55 (35.4%) with anosmia (4). Tong et al. screened the literature, excluding case reports and reviews, and finally found 10 studies on olfactory dysfunction published in 2020 from a total of 9 countries, including China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, and France; two studies were multinational. Peter used a random-effects model to perform a meta-analysis, where a total of 845 patients (52.73%) reported olfactory dysfunction of different levels among 1,627 patients (5). Similar findings were reported by Pang et al. in a meta-analysis of 60 studies including 17,401 COVID-19 patients, where the overall incidence of olfactory dysfunction was 56% (6). In a cohort study at the coronavirus testing center at Technische Universität Dresden, of 34 patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 64.7% of them experienced olfactory loss even before the onset of more typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and cough (7). The above studies suggest that the incidence of anosmia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is high and should not be ignored in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients.",
            "Besides the reported incidence of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, some studies have focused on the regularity of olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2. Yujie et al. conducted a questionnaire survey of 86 COVID-19 patients in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital to analyze the development regularity of olfactory dysfunction and found that the average interval from the onset of hyposmia to the onset of symptoms of typical pneumonia was 0.22 ± 4.57 days, while the average duration of hyposmia was 9.09 ± 5.74 days (8). According to the research of Lechien et al., the recovery time of olfactory function in 33% of COVID-19 patients with hyposmia or anosmia (n = 357) was 1-4 days, while it was 5-8 days in 39.6% of patients, 9-14 days in 24.2% of patients, and more than 15 days in 3.3% of patients. When limiting their study to patients with anosmia, 20.3% of patients took 1-4 days to recover their olfactory function, 47.5% took 5-8 days to recover their olfactory function, 28.8% took 9-14 days to recover their olfactory function, and 3.4% took more than 15 days to recover their olfactory function (9). In another study of olfactory dysfunction, the authors also found that patients (N = 99) lost their olfaction for an average of 8.41 ± 5.05 days (10). Amer et al. also conducted a clinical cohort study of 96 COVID-19 patients with olfactory dysfunction (11), where 80 patients (83%) showed sudden anosmia but only 17% experienced a gradual decrease in olfaction; however, 80% of patients with a gradual decrease in olfaction said they had been in contact with someone with anosmia. These authors also observed that 32 patients (33.3%) had complete olfactory recovery within 1 month, with an average recovery time of 7 days, while 40 patients (41.7%) had partial olfactory recovery and 24 patients (25.0%) achieved no significant recovery. Meini et al. followed up with 100 COVID-19 patients and asked them to rate their recovery of olfactory function on a scale of 100 points, where a score of 80-95 points was considered to suggest a near-complete recovery of olfactory function, and a score of 100 points was considered to indicate a complete recovery of olfactory function. Their final analysis showed that, among patients with subjective symptoms of anosmia (n = 29), about 64% had a complete recovery of their olfaction within 1 month and 19% had a near-complete recovery of their olfaction (12). A multicenter prospective study of 138 COVID-19 patients by Vaira et al. reported that the majority of patients showed the most remarkable amelioration in their olfactory dysfunction between 10 and 20 days after COVID-19 onset, with the majority largely recovering within 30 days (13). Considering these studies, it is not difficult to find that olfactory dysfunction is a characteristic clinical manifestation of COVID-19, with an incidence rate of about 56%, and most of the lost olfactory dysfunction can be recovered within 1 month.",
            "In brief, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes olfactory dysfunction, but it may be distinctly different from that demonstrated with URTIs caused by other viruses. Considering the overall incidence rates of olfactory dysfunction, the incidence rate of olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of olfactory dysfunction caused by a common viral UTRI. The average incidence of olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 reaches about 55%, or even as high as 80% in some articles and reports, while the average incidence of olfactory dysfunction of other viral UTRIs is about 25%. Seiden et al. reviewed the data of 428 patients with olfactory dysfunction at the Cincinnati University Taste and Smell Clinic, and 78 patients reported a prior UTRI (14). Similar results have also been obtained in other centers. The Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center found that about 18.6% of 441 post-URTI patients had olfactory dysfunction (15).",
            "Updated studies suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains, in particular the D164G mutation, may increase the incidence rate of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. von Bartheld et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in South Asian population and found that for the same ethnic group, the incidence of olfactory dysfunction was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients mainly infected with G614 virus strain (31.8%) than in patients mainly infected with D416 virus strain (5.3%) (16). Most of the SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains, such as β (B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2), Epsilon (B.1.427 and B.1.429), D164G site mutations were found. In contrast, a cohort study by Brandal et al. from Norway found that only 10 (12%) of 81 patients infected with the SARS-CoV Omicron Variant developed olfactory dysfunction (17) (Table 1).",

            "URTIV, upper respiratory tract infection virus; QS, questionnaire survey; VAS, visual analogue scale.",
            "There are also differences in the onset and duration of olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 and that caused by other viruses, respectively. Both olfactory dysfunction attributed to COVID-19 and that attributed to other viral URTIs can appear in the incipient stages of viral infection. Olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients can be detected even before the typical symptoms of pneumonia appear, lasts for a shorter time, and the patient recovers more quickly. Although the possibility of olfactory recovery decreases with the duration of olfactory dysfunction, the recovery rates of olfactory dysfunction after COVID-19 tend to be higher (Table 2).",
            "Characteristics of olfactory dysfunction attributed to COVID-19 vs. other viral UTRIs.",
            "COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; URTI, upper respiratory tract infection.",
            "There are many different explanations for the mechanism of olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2. Most patients often present with nasal congestion or a runny nose and other acute rhinitis symptoms after experiencing an acute URTI. At that time, the nasal mucosa is swollen because of acute inflammation, capillary dilatation, and an increase in nasal secretions. As a result, if swollen nasal mucosa and secretions block the binding of odorant molecules to olfactory receptors, the patient develops a secondary conductive olfactory dysfunction.",
            "However, a number of studies have shown that rhinitis symptoms caused by inflammation of the nasal mucosa do not seem to be significantly associated with the occurrence of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. A prospective questionnaire study by Speth et al. found that 30-50% of 103 COVID-19 patients had nasal congestion and a runny nose, while 61.2% showed olfactory dysfunction, with 14.6% believing that their olfaction decreased and another 46.6% believing that their olfaction was almost completely gone at its worst point. However, the occurrence of olfactory dysfunction was found by univariate analysis to not be significantly associated with concomitant rhinitis symptoms (20). Lechien et al. also found no significant correlation between olfactory dysfunction and rhinitis symptoms after a statistical analysis of 417 patients who rated their own otolaryngological symptoms and COVID-19 severity (9). These studies suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 differs from other common viral infections in the area of olfactory dysfunction, and also that COVID-19 may involve olfactory dysfunction through other mechanisms besides mucosal inflammation.",
            "Unlike other upper respiratory viruses, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is first cleaved by TMPRSS2 and interacts with high affinity to ACE2. Then the virus is endocytosed, cleaved by cathepsin L (CSTL), and fused with the endosomal membrane, thereby releasing the single-stranded RNA into the cytoplasm and making further virus replication, assembly, release and further infection and destruction. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect nasal epithelial cells with high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 through the above-mentioned mechanisms (Figure 1). Besides, although the SARS-CoV-2 variants differ in their pathogenicity, they all enter the nasal cavity by binding to the ACE2, causing various symptoms. Some SARS-CoV-2 mutations, such as T478K, may locate in the region interacting with ACE2, enhancing the binding ability of the virus to ACE2 (26), or at the Furin protease cleavage site of spike protein, such as P681R, where the mutation can facilitate the fusion process of SARS-CoV-2 with human cell membrane (27). D614G mutation may enhance the stability of spike protein by inducing conformational changes of spike protein, leading to increased infectivity (16). These mechanisms all contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, increasing the infectivity of the mutant strain, and causing a higher incidence of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.",
            "Possible mechanisms of the olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2.",
            "In the span of weeks to months, SARS-CoV-2 spread worldwide, similar to the performance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003. Both viruses are highly infectious, spread quickly, and primarily colonize the respiratory tract. Similarly, infection with SARS-CoV can also impair olfaction in patients. Gu Jiang, a professor at the Peking University Health Science Center, said at a symposium on SARS-CoV prevention that the virus was found in the nasal mucosa of more than 20 patients during autopsy.",
            "Coronaviruses are neurotropic, as demonstrated in both human and animal models. In 2004, experts detected the RNA of SARS-CoV in the cerebrospinal fluid of a 32-year-old woman in Hong Kong. One year later, SARS-CoV was isolated from the brain tissue of a patient with neurological symptoms (28). The same year, another report also shared that SARS-CoV was detected in the brains of eight patients who died from their infections, and the presence of SARS-CoV RNA was noted in the cytoplasm of many hypothalami and cortical neurons. In 2008, Netland et al. inoculated C57BL/6 transgenic mice intranasally with SARS-CoV and stained for virus antigens to determine the entry site of the virus. These authors ultimately found that the greatest amount of virus antigen was present in the olfactory bulb, which proved that SARS-CoV may enter the body through the olfactory nerve. This is followed by rapid transneuronal spread, eventually making it to the brain (29). Owing to the highly similar structures of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, it is speculated that COVID-19 may also involve olfactory dysfunction in this way—namely, SARS-CoV-2 may also be able to spread down the olfactory nerve to the olfactory bulb and the central nervous system, or directly infect the olfactory bulb through the cribriform plate. Then, the virus may follow the olfactory pathway and attack the olfactory cortex in the frontal lobe of the brain, which is answerable for olfaction. However, olfactory dysfunction resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection is not caused by direct damage to the central nervous system; if it were, the onset and recovery of olfactory dysfunction would be slower and the symptoms would likely be more complex. Thus, the mechanism of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 may differ from that of other viruses; not only is secondary conducive olfactory dysfunction caused by acute inflammation after infection with other viruses, but other mechanisms also participate. Previous studies have found that olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium of mice infected with H1N1 were reduced in number, the olfactory epithelium became thinner, and the expression level of olfactory marker protein messenger RNA decreased, suggesting that this may be one of the pathogeneses of olfactory dysfunction after virus infection (30). Furthermore, the literature has reported that other viruses may reduce the number of olfactory tracts and cause the loss of olfactory receptor cilia after URTI. Some of the olfactory epithelium may be replaced by respiratory epithelium, or there may be extensive scarring (31, 32)—that is, part of the olfactory epithelium might lose its original characteristics during infection, which may lead to olfactory dysfunction.",
            "It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 can infect immune-privileged sites like eyes and brain. For example, a female COVID-19 patient with glaucoma underwent two NEGATIVE RT-PCR tests after conventional treatment, but SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected again in her upper respiratory tract and aqueous humor 2 months later (33). Solomon et al. found SARS-CoV-2 specific antigens and RNA in 3 medulla sections, 3 lobe, and 3 olfactive nerve sections on the autopsies of 18 dead COVID-19 patients (34). The central system is also one of the immune-privileged parts of the human body, so we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may also persist in the central system, which makes that a small number of patients may not recover significantly from olfactory dysfunction. The way how the virus gets into the brain is still to be explored.",
            "Other scholars have speculated, from the perspective of molecular biology, that SARS-CoV-2 may enter the central nervous system by infecting peripheral tissues through the cellular mechanism of active transport, leading to secondary olfactory damage (35). According to the research of Ibekwe et al., SARS-CoV-2 may also directly attack and damage olfactory receptors, thus inhibiting the transmission of odor signals. This can lead to temporary or permanent anosmia (36). In addition, some scholars believe that drug treatment and the use of a large number of disinfectants may lead to olfactory dysfunction during COVID-19.",
            "At present, there are few reports on the treatment of olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2. In view of the similarities between the mechanism of olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 and that of olfactory dysfunction caused by other viruses, this study briefly covers literature on the treatment of olfactory dysfunction caused by other viruses for reference.",
            "For viral URTIs, including COVID-19, if the olfactory dysfunction is caused by acute inflammation, such as nasal mucosal swelling, glucocorticoids can be applied inside the nasal cavity or systemically to treat the olfactory dysfunction. Glucocorticoids are known to regulate the body's immune response in cells and transcription; at the cellular level, they can cause apoptosis of T lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils to reduce inflammation, while, at the transcriptional level, glucocorticoids can repress a plethora of cytokines, chemokines, cell-adhesion molecules, inflammatory enzymes, and the pro-inflammatory genes of receptors to resolve the inflammatory process (37). The systemic use of glucocorticoids may be more effective than topical administration. Seiden et al. reported that topical hormone therapy improved olfactory dysfunction in 25% of patients, while systemic hormone therapy was effective in 83% of patients with olfactory dysfunction (14). However, the effect of glucocorticoids on nervous olfactory dysfunction caused by the impairment of the olfactory epithelium and olfactory nerve is not ideal.",
            "The cells of the olfactory nerve are capable of regeneration; thus, drug therapy that can support and promote olfactory nerve regeneration may be beneficial for olfactory recovery. Retinoic acid (RA), a metabolite of vitamin A, is a significant transcriptional regulator of tissue development and regeneration. Studies have found that RA signaling is activated during embryonic development of the olfactory system and neuron regeneration in adults (38), suggesting that the application of vitamin A inside the nose may be beneficial in the treatment of post-infection neural olfactory dysfunction. Meanwhile, lipoic acid, a B vitamin, is a powerful antioxidant and is thought to be suitable for treating nerve damage involving free radicals. Hummel et al. provided alpha-lipoic acid daily to 23 patients with post-URTI olfactory dysfunction and found that 14 patients (61%) experienced improved olfactory dysfunction after treatment, including 8 who reported significantly improved olfactory function (39). In addition, adequate vitamin C and E intake may also help restore olfactory nerves' function by protecting nerve cells or promoting recovery. Other literature has reported that treatment with sodium citrate (40), zinc (41), and caroverine (42) may have a certain effect on the recovery of patient olfactory function.",
            "Olfactory training is a therapy during which patients actively and repeatedly sniff various types of odors to improve their olfactory function. In 2009, Hummel et al. found that olfactory function improved in about 30% of patients over a 12-week period of olfactory training compared to those who did not participate in olfactory training, and olfactory training was effective not only in patients with post-URTI olfactory dysfunction but also in patients with post-traumatic traumatic or idiopathic olfactory dysfunction (43). Damm et al. also believed that repeated short-term exposure to different odors may modulate the regenerative capacity of the olfactory mucosa, leading to the regeneration and increased expression of olfactory receptor neurons, thus enhancing olfactory sensitivity (44). In addition, increasing the types of odors and prolonging the period of olfactory training may also improve the success rate of olfactory dysfunction treatment (45).",
            "Although SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same coronavirus family as SARS-CoV, both the transmissibility and infectivity of the former are stronger. Many studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to olfactory dysfunction, and many scholars believe that neurosensory symptoms, such as olfactory dysfunction, can be used as a diagnostic maker for the early diagnosis of COVID-19. The symptoms of olfactory dysfunction may also be considered as part of routine screening for COVID-19 (8).",
            "In this study, the characteristics of olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are analyzed and summarized. The incidence of olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is relatively higher, but the average duration of olfactory dysfunction or anosmia is shorter and the possibility of olfactory recovery is higher compared to the post-URTI olfactory dysfunction caused by other common viruses. These differences may be related to the unique structure, high infectivity and mutation sites of the SARS-CoV-2 and the variations in the main mechanism of olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 and by the other upper respiratory viruses.",
            "It is worth noting that the SARS-CoV-2 is mutating. The Omicron variant is currently sweeping the world, but studies have found that COVID-19 patients infected with Omicron variant are significantly less likely to develop olfactory dysfunction, exhibiting symptoms indistinguishable from those of influenza. Its reason may be that extensive vaccination has caused patients infected with the Omicron variant to develop only mild symptoms, or even asymptomatic infection. Therefore, the public should strengthen prevention and control of the pandemic and vaccination.",
            "The treatment of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients has been poorly reported to date. At present, there is no clear consensus or guidelines for the treatment of olfactory dysfunction after viral infection caused by other mechanisms, except for conductive olfactory dysfunction caused by nasal mucosal swelling or nasal obstruction caused by acute inflammation. Vitamins, zinc, calcium channel blockers, and olfactory rehabilitation training may be effective as therapeutic options in the treatment of other olfactory dysfunction caused by other viral infection, and their effects on the olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection still need to be confirmed by randomized controlled trials.",
            "In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to olfactory dysfunction in patients, albeit with an earlier onset, shorter duration, and higher incidence and recovery rates compared to other viral infections. Olfactory functions are very important to human life, so medical personnel should adopt careful measures of investigating, understanding, and identifying olfactory dysfunction, and actively offer corresponding treatment measures.",

            "In the past two years, the world has faced the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which by August of 2022 has infected around 619 million people and caused the death of 6.55 million individuals globally. Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the respiratory tract level, there are several reports, indicating that other organs such as the heart, kidney, pancreas, and brain can also be damaged. A characteristic observed in blood serum samples of patients suffering COVID-19 disease in moderate and severe stages, is a significant increase in proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-α (IFN-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), as well as the presence of autoantibodies against interferon-α (IFN-α), interferon-λ (IFN-λ), C-C motif chemokine ligand 26 (CCL26), CXC motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), family with sequence similarity 19 (chemokine (C-C motif)-like) member A4 (FAM19A4), and C-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CCL1). Interestingly, it has been described that the chronic cytokinemia is related to alterations of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and induction of neurotoxicity. Furthermore, the generation of autoantibodies affects processes such as neurogenesis, neuronal repair, chemotaxis and the optimal microglia function. These observations support the notion that COVID-19 patients who survived the disease present neurological sequelae and neuropsychiatric disorders. The goal of this review is to explore the relationship between inflammatory and humoral immune markers and the major neurological damage manifested in post-COVID-19 patients.",
            "The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has increased morbidity and mortality rates worldwide (1, 2). According to various clinical reports and laboratory studies, it is known that the virus can affect different organs such as respiratory tract, lungs, heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, muscles, and nervous system at different levels (3–5). During the pandemic course, several post COVID-19 effects have been observed that hinder total patient recovery. The World Health Organization (WHO) has denominated these symptoms as long COVID or COVID-19 condition, defining it as a condition that “occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms and that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Symptoms may be new onset following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time” (6–8).",
            "Several follow-up studies in patients suffering long COVID have documented cardiovascular alterations, fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, appetite loss and hair loss. Interestingly nervous system seems particularly affected after COVID-19 disease (9, 10). Patients have reported headaches and dizziness, as well as psychiatric disorders and motor discoordination (11–13). In a period of 7 months after viral infection, some patients have presented conditions that are mainly related to neuropsychiatric and neurological deficits, with a prevalence of 19.7% to 36% (4, 14, 15). The characteristic symptoms of these alterations are anosmia, hypogeusia, partial or total hyposmia (16, 17), myalgia, cerebral inflammation, cerebrovascular strokes (18), acute encephalopathy, seizures, Guillain-Barré syndrome (19), neurocognitive disorders, sleep disorders, delirium, memory deficit, concentration deficit, depression, psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia (20), chronic fatigue and partial or total apraxia (21).",
            "Similar to the neurological alterations of SARS-CoV-2 post-infection, there are data from patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS. The clinical follow-up carried out on these patients recorded symptoms of depression, disorder of post-traumatic stress (PTSD), anxiety, sleep disorders, weakness, chronic fatigue and general pain, in a follow-up period covering 6 to 20 months post-infection (22, 23), symptoms set similar to the neurological alterations reported in SARS-CoV-2 post-infection. A meta-analysis of 120,970 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 revelated that women are more susceptible to present moderate neurological and cardiovascular long-COVID symptoms. It also was reported that age is directly related to a higher incidence of psychiatric, respiratory, digestive and skin conditions. In addition, in a subgroup of 106,284 participants it was observed an incidence of 19.7% of neurological disorders, where the main manifestations included, concentration difficulty (14.6%), headache, disorders of the taste and smell, cognitive impairment, memory deficits, dizziness, and cramps. Furthermore, psychiatric conditions affected 20.3% of the participants, who presented PTSD, depression, sleep disorder and anxiety (14).",
            "The analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood samples of 127 patients, who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and showed neurological damage symptoms after 7 days of infection, revelated that they suffered systemic inflammation and impaired blood-brain barrier (BBB). The neurological manifestations included encephalopathy, altered consciousness, delayed walking reaction, epilepsy-like electroencephalogram (EEG) changes, cerebral ischemia, myelitis, cerebellar ataxia, sensorimotor symptoms of unknown cause, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, anosmia, headache and nausea (24). Altogether these studies indicate a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurological conditions observed in long COVID. The main goal of this review is to elucidate the role of the antiviral dysregulation response by the immune system and its relationship with the sequelae of damage to the central nervous system (CNS) in patients with long COVID.",
            "It has been documented that coronaviruses have the ability to affect the CNS (25). In this context, several investigations have discovered that β-coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 can infect the CNS (25–29). Furthermore, traces of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in the olfactory mucosa, trans olfactory mucosa, neuronal projections and neurons during and after the infection period (30–34). In some COVID-19 cases the first symptoms presented by patients is hyposmia or anosmia. This could be due to the olfactory epithelium damage caused by the coronavirus, which in turn affects the olfactory neural network that is connected with the primary olfactory cortex (35–37). To date there is no precise understanding about the dynamics of the initial antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 that occur at the level of the olfactory epithelium. However, there are data from nasal samples that showed an increase of proinflammatory cytokines within two days after the first symptoms, compared with samples of same tissue that were taken at longer times (5 or more days after presenting the first symptoms), when the levels of proinflammatory cytokines decreased (17). This could indicate that the immune response produced in the olfactory epithelium associated with nerve cells occurs in a transient manner. However, this response is sufficient to generate some neuronal damage either by a direct action of the virus or by an indirect mechanism that involves the dysregulation of the immune response.",
            "The BBB is the main physiological structural interconnection between the external environment and the brain whose main function is to protect central neurons. It also participates in the selective transit of cells, nutrients and brain cell metabolism toxic byproducts (38). When a systemic inflammation process occurs, the BBB induces a series of brain responses whose main objective is to promote brain survival, which is known as disease behavior (39). This response induces a set of physiological and behavioral changes, coordinated and executed by the brain, which protect the individual from the various phases occurring during an infection. For example, the induction of lethargy allows to fight infection through the induction of fever and anorexia (40, 41).",
            "In patients who succumbed to COVID-19 and who had an exacerbated inflammatory response, presented BBB involvement manifested through multifocal vascular damage caused by autoantibodies. This process that induced serum proteins infiltration into the brain parenchyma, generalized endothelial cell activation, classical complement pathway activation, platelet aggregates and microthrombi adhered to endothelial cells throughout the vascular lumen. In addition, the infiltration of macrophages, T cells and B cells into brain structures has been reported, observing a greater presence of CD8+ T cells in the perivascular region compared to CD4+ cells. There are also reports of astrogliosis in perivascular regions and microglial nodule formation in the hindbrain, which is associated with focal neuronal loss and neuronophagia (42).",
            "The SARS-CoV-2 induces a nuclear structure reorganization and the dispersion of the genomic compartments of the cell, which leads to the low expression of the genes ADCY3, CNGA2, GN13, GFY, OMP, LHX2 and ATF5, which are key in the olfactory receptors signaling and this downregulation lead to anosmia (17). It has been proposed that once the virus enters the olfactory receptor neurons, the infection is propagated through the synaptic connections (43). In the case of the olfactory receptor neurons-mitral cells axis, there is an activation of the glial, which in turn promote the release proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-α, TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, IL-18, CXCL10, CXCL12, CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL7, CCL11, GM-CSF and B cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF). These cytokines that have been detected at elevated levels in samples of CSF, brain tissue, and serum of peripheral blood from patients with severe COVID-19 (44–49). It should be noted that the upregulated production of these cytokines can cause serious damage to the CNS, since it promotes neuronal stress and apoptosis, as well as the interruption of the BBB (43). In a mild respiratory COVID mouse model, it was observed that these events eventually increase neuroinflammation cascades causing synaptic loss, demyelination, excitotoxicity and transcriptional downregulation of Trem2, Sall3 and Adrb1 genes in microglia, the latter gene being an indicator of white matter degeneration (48). Other cerebral regions can potentially be affected by a similar mechanism. For instance, midbrain dopamine neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells are selectively permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This triggers an inflammatory response at neuronal level and the expression of the insulin like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) and LAMININ B1 genes associated with cellular senescence (32). The expression of these molecules leads to the overactivation of glia and trigger mechanisms of neuronal damage (50). Overall, the neuronal damage associated with the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines could be the cause of the appearance of neurological symptoms related with long COVID (\nTable 1\n).",
            "Upregulated cytokines associated at neurological damage observed in patients with long COVID.",
            "The effects that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces in brain structures was analyzed on 401 patients who suffered from COVID-19. Using the UK Biobank database, there was a selection of patients with brain imaging studies prior to COVID infection, and all patients were subject to brain imaging 38 months later. All the patients had at least one or more of the following affectations: significant reduction in gray matter thickness and tissue contrast in the orbitofrontal cortex, changes in diffusion measures, which are indicators of tissue damage, increase in CSF volume and overall size brain reduction (37). These changes were consistent and related to previously detected cognitive impairment in the study population. SARS-CoV-2 infection also changes the vasculature of the brain, since one of the damages induced by the virus is ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular strokes (84). A postmortem study in patients who died from severe COVID-19 revelated the presence of viral inclusion structures, accumulation of inflammatory cells in the vascular endothelium (lymphocytic endotheliitis), and endothelial cell apoptosis (50). All these sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS has been monitored in the serum and CSF of patients with long COVID who present neurological damage symptoms (encephalopathy, seizures, paraplegia, paresis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, ataxia and dysesthesia). These patients show a slight increase in white blood cells and an increase in the concentrations of total proteins and albumin, which indicates that the virus triggers a systemic dysfunction that can be detected at blood and CSF level (24).",
            "Once a virus reaches the nerves and brain tissue, an inflammatory mechanism is activated which aims to limit the infection process, eliminate the virus, or repair cell damage. Depending on the activated immunological pathway and the magnitude with which it is activated, the response can have positive or negative consequences on the physiology and behavior of the individual (85). The complications of exacerbated neuroinflammation can include headache, ischemia, interstitial edema, cerebral vasodilatation, blood vessel injury, vomiting, visual loss, blood stasis, increased cerebral pressure, cognitive problems, and loss of consciousness (86–89). Neuroinflammation characterized by an early and brief inflammatory response is considered neuroprotective, and is initiated by the activation of glial and endothelial cells (90, 91). On the contrary, a prolonged neuroinflammatory activation induces damage to brain structures and tissues, which has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (92, 93).",
            "The role of the microglia during resting conditions is to constantly examine the brain microenvironment to maintain homeostasis through the elimination of cellular waste (94). When there is a damage to neuronal structures, a process known as microglia activation occurs. This process is characterized by the release of cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory molecules (95). However, when the immune response is dysregulated, the exacerbated release of proinflammatory cytokines occurs, which has been associated with high mortality in patients with COVID-19 (96). This type of patients show microglia hyperactivation through multisystem inflammatory syndrome (97, 98) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (99).",
            "Dysregulation of the immune response due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection has the ability to downregulate angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) expression, which influences the activation and balance of the inflammatory pathway (100). The decreased expression of ACE-2 increases the concentration of Ang-II favoring the ACE/Ang-II/AT1R pathway. This leads to the activation of the NF-κB transcription factor and the consequent activation of the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines (101). Altered cytokine concentrations have been observed in samples of both patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 and in patients with manifestations associated with long COVID (43, 102, 103). The increase in Ang-II concentration also favors the Ang-II/aminopeptidase-A/Ang-III/aminopeptidase-A/Ang-IV/AT4R pathway (104, 105). The increase in Ang-III concentration induces hormone overproduction such as vasopressin in the hypothalamus and aldosterone in the adrenal gland (105). These alterations result in increased peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure. Moreover, Ang-III dysregulates Na+/K+ equilibrium which results in vascular damage, stroke and heart attack (106, 107). Both Ang-III and Ang-IV can bind to AT1R, thus induce the activation of this receptor and the activation consequently of the NF-κB transcription factor (105, 108, 109). The increase of Ang-IV dysregulates the vasodilatation process, increases the excretion of sodium, and the release of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, favoring the development of thrombotic events both in lungs and in the brain (108, 110–113). According to transcriptome databases, ACE2 is expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells (114). We believe that ACE-2 downregulation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is one of the first pathways responsible for immunological response damage to the CNS.",
            "An additional mechanism associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines induction occurs when the virus infects the cell, and the innate immune system detects viral RNA genome, either as ssRNA or one of dsRNA’s intermediaries through the Toll-Like Receptors including TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8 (115, 116). These receptors are responsible for activation of transcription factors such as IRF3, IRF7, NF-κB, ISRE3, and API. This transcription factors are related to the expression of key proinflammatory cytokines in the antiviral response such as TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-γ (115, 117). IFN-α and IFN-β activates genes involved in apoptosis processes, in the modulation of immune response, in cellular attraction and adhesion, and genes involved in antiviral and pathogenic detection (118). The balance that exists between IFN-α and IFN-β concentrations is key in the regulation of the inflammatory response. If there is any imbalance in their concentrations, the IFN-γ production is affected and therefore the anti-inflammatory process does not occur. In addition a chronic inflammation is promoted when the humoral response is deficient (119). Interestingly, in samples of respiratory epithelial cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells from patients with severe COVID-19, there is a decrease of type-I IFNs associated with self-recessive deficiencies in genes that code for the proteins involved in interferon production (e.g. TLR3, UNC93B, TRIF, TBK1, TBK1, IRF3, IRF7, IFNAR1/2, MYD88, GATA2 and IRAK4) (120–126). In CSF samples of patients with acute COVID-19 and sings of neurological damage, it was found a reduced interferon response, expansion of clonal T cells and a depletion of CD4+ T cells (127). Thus, it is possible that the interferon production during and after infection is a key point in the process of regulating systemic and neuronal inflammation.",
            "The inflammatory response in the CNS system is mediated by resident microglia and astrocytes (128), which detects the presence of an exogenous or pathogenic agent such as SARS-CoV-2 (129). Besides its direct participation in the elimination of an infection, the microglia establish the balance between the innate immune response and the adaptive immune response (130, 131). During acute COVID-19, the exacerbated release of proinflammatory cytokines promotes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which causes stress and cell damage at the systemic level, affecting brain tissue (129). In some COVID-19 patients these cellular events manifest in symptoms such as ischemia, inflammation of brain tissue, obstruction of blood flow, headaches, loss of consciousness, cerebral edema, and neuronal death (131–133).",
            "Previous studies have reported that during influenza virus infection there is an increase in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, and TNF-α, in the CSF of patients who present neurological alterations such as acute encephalitis and encephalopathy (134, 135). It is also known that patients infected with human orthopneumovirus and presenting neurological symptoms such as encephalitis and encephalopathies, have elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, and CCL4 in CSF samples (136, 137). West Nile virus is also known to cause a neuroinvasive disease manifesting meningitis, meningoencephalitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis, commonly associated with diarrhea/vomiting, weakness, impaired vision, confusion, or drowsiness, and shows elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL4, IL6, and IL10 in serum samples (138). Finally, Zika virus can infect the CNS and induce microcephaly in fetuses and rare but serious neurological diseases in adults, which are associated with excessive production of IFN-α, IFN-β, IL-6, and TNF-α (139).",
            "Interestingly, these neuroinflammatory pathological processes observed in long COVID patients, resemble those that occur in early phase of Parkinson’s disease (PD and AD (92). For example, high levels of TNF-α and low levels of TNF-β have been detected in CSF samples from patients with mild cognitive impairment who progressed to AD, and the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, tend to increase slowly, while the cytokines IL-18, MCP-1, and IP-10 peak at a certain stage of the disease (140, 141). Activation of microglial cells has been detected in the substantia nigra of patients with PD, due to the fact that aggregated α-synuclein is released from the damaged dopaminergic neurons (142). The accumulation of α-synuclein leads microglia to a reactive proinflammatory phenotype in which TNF-α, nitric oxide, and IL-1β are produced, generating a neuroinflammatory state as recently shown in an in vitro model of PD (143).",
            "Part of neurological sequelae previously mentioned suffered by SARS-CoV-2 patients, were also reported in individuals who survived SARS-CoV-1 infection in 2004 who presented cerebrovascular disorders such as ischemic stroke (144). These affectations could be caused by abnormalities in coagulation and hyperinflammation promoted by the presence of antiphospholipid autoantibodies (eg. antiphosphatidylserine or antiprothrombin) produced by plasma cells (88, 145, 146). Autoantibodies are a type of antibodies that recognize epitopes present in organs or tissues of the same individual and are related to the development of autoimmune diseases including allergies and oncopathologies (147, 148). Much of the generation of these autoantibodies is caused by genetic mutations, infections or environmental factors (149). The autoantibody generation can result from an altered production of cytokines, stimulation of toll-like receptors, or pattern recognition receptors (150). Furthermore, they can also originate from an inadequate and dysregulated release of autoantigens by cells and tissues, and/or molecular mimicry (150, 151). In the case of COVID-19 infection, various studies indicate that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the causal agent of inducing the autoantibodies generation, which might be a common characteristic in coronavirus infections (147, 148, 150, 152). It has been reported that the antibodies produced by plasma cells against spike protein or receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 can cross-bind with own antigens (153). In a follow-up study of 610 patients after 6 to 12 months post-infection with SARS-CoV-2, there were low concentrations of IgM and IgG3 that correlated with a predisposition to develop long COVID. Moreover, 71% of these patients presented severe COVID-19 and bronchial asthma at the same time (152). Regarding these immunoglobulins, it is known that both are induced by the controlled production of interferons and antagonized by IL-14 (154, 155). In addition, IgMs have a relevant role in the humoral response since it is the first immunoglobulin that participates in pathogen elimination (156). IgMs functions as a powerful complement activator, participate in the activation and regulation of the inflammatory response, opsonization, and destruction of pathogens present in the circulatory system (155, 157). In addition, IgMs are associated with the protective mechanisms of the vasculature and mucous membranes (157). IgG3s, activate the complement system and have a great affinity with Fc receptors (158). The deficiency of IgG3s is related with the development of autoimmune diseases (159). This could indicate that the innate immune response dysregulation directly affects the humoral response activation process, which leads to a deficient, non-specific and delayed production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.",
            "In a recent multicenter study it was proposed that a deficient and prolonged immune response in hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients promotes the adaptive immune response that attacks non-structural viral proteins and causes the development of IgG autoantibodies (160). Similarly, a proteomic profiling analysis revealed that the generation of certain autoantibodies (e.g. MUC1 or TNFRSF6B) is associated with the severity of the disease (147). Consistent with this notion, several investigations have also found that patients who had COVID-19 exhibit marked increases in autoantibody reactivity compared with uninfected individuals (160, 161). These individuals show a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins (including cytokines, chemokines, complement components, and cell surface proteins) (162). The main consequence of these autoantibodies is the disruption of the immune function and the impairment of the virologic control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signaling and altering the composition of peripheral immune cells (163, 164).",
            "There are cases where the presence of autoantibodies can be detected prior to any viral infection, suggesting a genetic predisposition to the generation of these autoantibodies (165). This could explain why some COVID-19 patients are more susceptible to produce autoantibodies that promote long COVID (166, 167). Recent studies have shown that some of these autoantibodies have an affinity for blood vessel and nervous system proteins, which could explain the neurological effects of long COVID by two mechanisms (168). First, autoantibodies could potentiate the cellular stress induced by proinflammatory cytokines. Second, autoantibodies could cause specific and long-term damage in patients suffering from post-COVID neurological sequelae (43, 168). In fact, COVID-19 patients with neurological sequelae produce autoantibodies that inhibit the function of key proteins involved in neuroprotection processes, neurite outgrowth, axogenesis, neuronal plasticity, neurotransmission, neuronal survival, and axonal regeneration (\nSupplementary Table 1\n) (167). The generation of these autoantibodies may aggravate the neuronal damage.",
            "The dysregulation of the immune response and the deficient elimination of cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 promote the release of autoantigens towards the extracellular space and the consequent generation of autoantibodies (169, 170). The analysis of the “autoantigenicoma” in patients who suffered from COVID-19 through the detection of autoantigens bound to determatan sulfate (autoantigen-DS complex) seems to be helpful to predict the appearance of autoimmune diseases and neurological damage (171, 172). Using this strategy, 751 autoantigen candidates were found, of which 657 are directly altered by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Remarkably, 400 of those autoantigens are related to autoimmune diseases and cancer (162). Regarding the nervous system, 150 autoantigens of proteins are related to axon guidance, neuron projection, myelin sheath, axon growth cone, neuronal cell body, cerebellar Purkinje cell layer, peripheral nervous system axon regeneration, radial glial scaffolds and proteins related to the olfactory bulb. There were also 193 autoantigens of proteins related to neurological diseases such as neuronal infection with Japanese encephalitis virus, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, neurodegeneration in Down syndrome, AD, schizophrenia, cerebral ischemia induced neurodegenerative diseases, PD, and neurodegeneration (\nSupplementary Table 2\n) (172). The mechanism by which coronaviruses could resemble conditions of early events of neurodegeneration should be explored considering the participation of the immune system and the uncontrolled generation of autoantibodies that deteriorate neuronal circuits.",
            "The effects of long COVID on the CNS are increasingly evident. For this reason, in the present work we analyzed the role of the immune response against the coronavirus and its impact on neuronal structures. The SARS-CoV-2 infects olfactory epithelial cells through ACE-2 (173). Through genetic rearrangements, the virus downregulates the expression of proteins such as olfactory receptors and ACE-2 (17, 100). The latter is implicated in the production of proinflammatory cytokines (43). When the immune system detects the entry of the virus, it activates the primary response, which is characterized by the release of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of immune cells. These processes are regulated by type-I INFs and together with IFN-γ (115, 117) induce the generation of antibodies (130, 131). However, due to the downregulation of ACE-2 and mutations in type I INFs, the inflammatory response is dysregulated, provoking the exacerbated release of proinflammatory cytokines (117). This response damages cellular structures and promotes the release of autoantigens (168, 169). At the same time, the dysregulation of the innate immune response affects the activation process of the humoral response (119, 169). This may lead to a nonspecific and delayed production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the generation of autoantibodies that recognize key proteins involved in neuronal regeneration and repair processes, thereby increasing neurodegeneration (167). We think this generates a cyclical process of recognition and destruction of neuronal structures (\nFigure 1\n). Depending on the region that is affected, this promotes the appearance of neurological symptoms observed in patients with long COVID.",
            "Proposed mechanism for neuro-long COVID. 1: SARS-CoV-2 infects olfactory epithelial and lungs. 2: Type-I IFNs production dysregulated during primary immune response process against SARS-CoV-2 infection. 3: Exacerbated release of proinflammatory cytokines. 4: The exacerbated and dysregulated inflammatory response causes the proinflammatory molecules release that damage the BBB, facilitate the infiltration of immune cells into brain tissue, activate microglia, and damaging brain tissue cells, causing the autoantigens release. 5: Innate immune response dysregulation affects the humoral response activation process and induce a nonspecific and delayed production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the generation of autoantibodies against key proteins involved in neuronal regeneration and repair processes. 6: Induction of neuronal death in specific areas.",

            "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulted in an unprecedented global crisis. Although primarily a respiratory illness, dysregulated immune responses may lead to multi-organ dysfunction. Prior data showed that the resident microbial communities of gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts act as modulators of local and systemic inflammatory activity (the gut–lung axis). Evolving evidence now signals an alteration in the gut microbiome, brought upon either by cytokines from the infected respiratory tract or from direct infection of the gut, or both. Dysbiosis leads to a “leaky gut”. The intestinal permeability then allows access to bacterial products and toxins into the circulatory system and further exacerbates the systemic inflammatory response. In this review, we discuss the available data related to the role of the gut microbiome in the development and progression of COVID-19. We provide mechanistic insights into early data with a focus on immunological crosstalk and the microbiome’s potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.",
            "Since it was first recognized, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global affliction (1). Although vaccines offer hope in curbing the pandemic (2), an improved understanding of its pathogenesis and concurrent efforts to explore preventive and therapeutic strategies remain a priority to consolidate the success of mass vaccination and herd immunity.",
            "The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to severe, life-threatening disease (3). Current understanding of pathogenesis postulates a rapid and intense hyperactivation of the immune system, resulting in critical illness and mortality (4). Older age, burden of comorbidities, obesity, immunocompromised states, malignancy or ongoing cancer treatment, and being a transplant recipient, have been strongly linked with severe, and sometimes fatal, outcomes (5–9). Evolving data suggest that a state of chronic inflammation or baseline activation of the immune system might influence the course of COVID-19 more than direct cytopathic effects of the SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, a subgroup of patients have been noted to develop auto-inflammatory symptoms (such as Kawasaki-like disease in children and multi-system inflammatory syndrome) long after clearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from body, suggesting an immune dysregulation (8, 10).",
            "In the human body, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is the largest immune organ (11). The pool of resident microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, and fungi) in the GIT, collectively known as the gut microbiota, not only supports mucosal immunity but also modulates the systemic immune response of the host (12). Current evidence from other respiratory illnesses indicates that the gut microbiota affects the immunity and inflammation in the lungs (13, 14). Lately, some studies have examined the association between gut microbiota and SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we present the existing data related to the intersection of gut microbiome and the host’s immune response to SARS-CoV-2. We further explore the role of gut microbiome diversity and its compositional differences as diagnostic biomarkers, and the potential of the gut microbiome as an interventional target in modifying COVID-19 outcomes.",
            "The human GIT is home to about 104–105 bacteria per millimeter of content in the small intestine, and 1011 bacteria per gram of colonic content (15). In a healthy person, the gut microbiota comprises more than 100 bacterial phyla and the majority of bacteria belong to Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, with Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla constituting over 90% of the entire gut microbiota (16). The microorganisms and their combined genetic material make up the gut microbiome, which outnumber the human genome by about 150 times (17). The proportion of the various phyla remains quasi-stable and unique for an individual, although a shift can be observed during a change in health status. For example, the gut microbiome in the elderly has been observed to drift away from Firmicutes and towards Proteobacteria and Alistipes (18).",
            "The gut microbiota exists in a symbiotic relationship with its host. It facilitates the synthesis of vitamins and fermentation of carbohydrates and other undigested nutrients and aids in the delivery of essential nutrients like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) to colonic epithelial cells. In addition, it also regulates mucosal permeability and provides deterrence against pathogenic microbes. More importantly, the microbiota plays an indispensable role in the preservation of intestinal homeostasis by modulating local and systemic immune responses of the host (19). The microbiota protects the GIT by (a) acting as a competitor against binding of pathogenic microbes, (b) neutralizing pathogens with their anti-microbial metabolites, (c) keeping the local immune system in a perpetual vigilant state, and (d) regulating the innate and adaptive immunity.",
            "In a healthy person, the proportion of the various phyla mostly remains quasi-stable and unique for an individual (18). An imbalanced state is described as “gut dysbiosis”, a condition characterized by an alteration in the abundance or composition of the microbiota. Gut dysbiosis may occur with aging, dietary effects, drugs, gastrointestinal infections, and anatomical alterations of the GIT. A significantly dysbiotic state may predispose to the diseases of GIT, such as Clostridioides difficile enterocolitis, which is associated with prolonged and recurrent broad-spectrum antibiotic usage (20). Since gut microbiota modulates the fine balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory systemic responses, a dysbiotic state has also been associated with non-gastrointestinal systemic illnesses such as malignancy (12), type 2 diabetes mellitus (21), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (22), coronary artery disease (23), neurodegenerative diseases (24), and depression (25).",
            "The GI and respiratory tracts share a common mucosal immune system, known as the gut–lung axis (26, 27). From birth, both tracts receive their quota of microbiota via the oral route (28), and subsequently establish a differing but internally quasi-stable genre of microorganisms or microbiota (29). Although the microbiota of both tracts consists of similar phyla, they differ at the level of species in composition and density. Understandably, studies on respiratory microbiota have been complicated by tedious and invasive methods for collection of uncontaminated lower respiratory samples, and most data have been derived from mice models where lung tissue can be aseptically obtained (30). Consequently, there is growing excitement in understanding this complex immunological intersection.",
            "Throughout the lifespan of an individual, established microbiota of both tracts contribute to the gut–lung axis, modulating both local and systemic immune responses when faced with a pathogenic threat. The axis is believed to be bidirectional, affecting the immune response of either tract when one site is activated (31). Using a germ-free murine model, Ichinohe et al. demonstrated potentially deleterious effects on respiratory immune responses after alteration of the gut microbiota with antibiotics (32). Other studies have also found that gut microbiota alterations result in abnormal activation of the immune system, predisposing to respiratory illnesses such as asthma, lung allergic responses, and chronic respiratory diseases (27, 33). Conversely, animal studies have also revealed an alteration in the gut microbiota after respiratory viral and bacterial infections (34–36). This distant effect is believed to be communicated by activation of the systemic immune system, with dysbiosis of either tract feeding into the other.",
            "While the immune-related interactions between resident gut and respiratory tract microbiota are yet to be explored, a conceptual understanding of the impact of the gut microbiota in patients with COVID-19 may be extrapolated by examining the existing evidence of its role in non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus infections.",
            "Many respiratory viral illnesses are commonly accompanied by GI symptoms. Previous studies during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 showed that diarrhea was a common symptom and occurred in 16%–73% of patients. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) was not only known to infect the lung epithelial cells but also the immune cells, triggering an intense immune response with elevation in Th2 cytokines (37). It was postulated that high levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines altered the gut microbiota and compromised intestinal integrity. The resultant “leaky” gut allowed translocation of bacterial products and antigens into the circulation, further exacerbating the illness (38). Due to the bidirectional nature of the gut–lung axis, an alteration in gut microbiota further augments the respiratory immune responses, conceivably resulting in a vicious perpetuation of systemic inflammatory response (32).",
            "Using a mouse-model, Deriu et al. demonstrated that respiratory viral infection due to influenza resulted in gut dysbiosis predisposing to secondary Salmonella infection via circulatory type I interferons (34). Similarly, Wang et al. demonstrated indirect intestinal inflammation with influenza infection in a mouse-model occurring via microbiota-mediated Th17 cell-dependent inflammation (36). Several studies have reported gut dysbiosis after respiratory viral infection (39, 40). Groves et al. showed that gut dysbiosis, in the form of an increase in Bacteroidetes and a decrease in Firmicutes phyla abundance, occurred in mice models with respiratory syncytial and influenza virus infections, but not in those vaccinated with live attenuated influenza viruses (41). Furthermore, elevated levels of colonic Muc5ac and fecal lipocalin-2 in the pathogenic infection group suggest the presence of low-grade gut inflammation during respiratory virus infection.",
            "Respiratory virus infection may also cause dysbiosis in lung microbiota, modulating both local immune responses within the lung parenchyma and systemically. Due to the difficulties in sampling of lung microbiota, only a few studies have examined the role of respiratory pathogens in altering lung microbiota. Molyneaux et al. reported an increased proportion of Proteobacteria and potentially pathogenic Haemophilus influenzae in the lower respiratory tract microbiota in rhinovirus-infected patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (42). Using a mouse-model inoculated with intranasal H1N1 influenza virus, Gu et al. demonstrated a bacterial class shift in the lung microbiota, which persisted even during the recovery period (43). Notwithstanding the limitations in available studies, a common theme has emerged showing a link between respiratory virus infection and an alteration in the gut and respiratory tract microbiota, with the presence of inflammation of the GIT.",
            "Although no specific interaction between any gut microbial species and SARS-CoV-2 has been identified to date, there is indirect evidence (44, 45) that gut microbiota may have a role in the overall pathogenesis of COVID-19, as summarized in \nFigure 1\n. Taking the corollary further from non-SARS-Cov-2 virus-mediated gut dysbiosis, it is conceivable that infection with SARS-CoV-2 may also be impacted by immunological interactions with the gut microbiota.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 and the lung–gut axis: SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the alveolar cells by binding with ACE2 receptors, which are also abundant on the surface of enterocytes. The implication of direct infection of enterocytes by SARS-CoV-2 is still being explored. The circulatory cytokines from alveolitis (and/or direct viral infection of the enterocytes) cause the GI dysbiosis with resultant alterations in GI mucosal barrier. The entry of bacterial products and toxins from the GIT floods the circulatory system with more pro-inflammatory cytokines. Image was created with Biorender.com.",
            "About half of patients with COVID-19 develop GI symptoms, which often precede the respiratory symptoms (45). In the respiratory tract, the SARS-CoV-2 infects the alveolar cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors. Interestingly, these receptors are also abundantly expressed on the surface of enterocytes (46), where they play an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of microbiota and mucosal inflammation (47). In one patient with COVID-19, Xiao et al. detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA, viral nucleocapsid protein, and ACE-2 in the epithelial cells of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and rectum (48). Several authors have also reported detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments, but not the whole virus, in stool samples (49, 50). A study by Lamers et al. also demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 was able to infect enterocyte lineage cells in a human intestinal organoid model (51). Unfortunately, due to the scarcity of autopsy studies and pragmatic restrictions on endoscopic examinations of the GIT, there are only limited data to support this hypothesis in vivo. It also remains unknown how SARS-CoV-2 may survive the acidic gastric environment to directly infect enterocytes. Overall, it is unclear whether the GI symptoms of COVID-19 are a result of primary infection of the GIT or derived from other indirect mechanisms mentioned below.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 is principally transmitted by respiratory droplets, but evidence is accumulating for fecal-oral transmission. The hypothesis is supported by the presence of GI symptoms, detection of SARS-CoV-2 nuclear fingerprints in the GI mucosa, and detection of viral fragments in fecal samples. Interestingly, the first COVID-19 patient in the United States tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via stool samples (52), and subsequent studies have consistently documented shedding of viral RNA in the stool samples in COVID-19 patients (53, 54). Furthermore, viral shedding in stool samples has been observed to persist longer than that in respiratory samples (55, 56).",
            "Elevated serum levels of pro-inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), are hallmarks of severe COVID-19 infection (57). These cytokines predispose to dysbiosis, which consequently alters intestinal permeability, a state known as the “leaky gut”. This enables further entry of a multitude of bacterial products and toxins, activating a pro-inflammatory cascade. In a study in 204 patients with COVID-19, Pan et al. reported that GI symptoms worsened with increasing severity of COVID-19 (58). In another study, fecal calprotectin levels (a marker of GI mucosal inflammation) were elevated in patients who had diarrhea during COVID-19 illness (59). A recent study by Prasad et al. measured several markers of gut permeability in the plasma (60). Levels of FABP2, PGN, and LPS were significantly higher among COVID-19 patients compared to healthy subjects, suggesting translocation of pro-inflammatory antigens from a leaky gut.",
            "Gu et al. first presented evidence of an altered gut microbiota in COVID-19 patients by using high-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA to compare the gut taxa of patients with COVID-19, H1N1 influenza, and healthy controls (61). Compared to healthy controls, COVID-19 patients had significantly reduced bacterial diversity, increased abundance of opportunistic pathogens (such as Streptococcus, Rothia, Veillonella, and Actinomyces), and significantly less diverse symbiotic species. Interestingly, the altered microbial signature in COVID-19 was different from patients with the H1N1 strain.",
            "In another study, Zuo et al. analyzed fecal samples of 15 patients with COVID-19 using shotgun metagenomic sequencing (62). The study revealed a marked increase in opportunistic pathogens and depletion of beneficial microbes as compared to healthy controls, which persisted even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest an inverse correlation between gut dysbiosis and COVID-19 severity and are congruent with the conclusions of a larger multi-center study in which Yeoh et al. examined the gut microbiota in 100 patients using shotgun sequencing. Fecal samples from 27 patients were analyzed longitudinally over 30 days, showing significant dysbiosis that persisted despite clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Correlative blood samples demonstrated an association between gut dysbiosis, elevation in the inflammatory mediators, and severity of systemic inflammation (63).",
            "Another study by Newsome et al. compared microbiota composition from stool samples of 50 COVID-19 patients with uninfected patients (64). Significant perturbations in the microbiota composition in the COVID-19 patients were observed, independent of antibiotic exposure. The gut “metabolome”, a biochemical signature derived from bacterial metabolic activity in the gut, is another method for detecting an alteration in the gut microbiota composition. In a recent study by Lv et al., fecal samples of COVID-19 patients had altered metabolomes, suggesting malnutrition and intestinal inflammation (65). These results provide new insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19.",
            "Although it was previously believed that gut dysbiosis in COVID-19 was mainly driven by inflammatory mediators from respiratory tract infection, a recent study suggests that active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the gut may be driving the dysbiosis (66). Using in vitro transcriptional analysis in a SARS-CoV-2-infected cell model (with samples obtained from stools), the 3’ end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was detected more than the 5’ end, suggesting active viral replication. Interestingly, majority of the patients had no GI symptoms, suggesting a quiescent GI infection despite active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the GIT with dysbiosis. Moreover, on functional analysis of the gut microbiota, fecal samples with signatures of high SARS-CoV-2 burden demonstrated high de novo nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis, correlating with increased bacterial proliferation. Although this was a pilot study comprising only 15 patients, further studies on alterations in the functionality of the gut microbiota may unearth the pathophysiology of COVID-19 illness.",
            "Overall, currently expanding evidence suggests that patients with COVID-19 suffer from an alteration in the gut microbiota during and after the illness. Both systemic inflammation and replicative potential of SARS-CoV-2 in the gut may contribute towards dysbiosis.",
            "Though limited in number, studies to date have consistently demonstrated gut dysbiosis in patients with COVID-19 (\nTable 1\n). A more important clinical implication lies in understanding whether, and how, gut microbiota predisposes to varying degrees of COVID-19 severity.",
            "Studies exploring the role of gut microbiota in COVID-19.",
            "As previously mentioned, clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to severe, life-threatening disease (3). A recent systematic review demonstrated that about one-third of patients remain clinically asymptomatic after infection with SARS-CoV-2 (68). However, a possibility of subclinical inflammatory process remains. In a systematic review involving 231 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, almost two-thirds (63%) had inflammatory changes in the lungs on computed tomography (CT) scan (67). Irrespective of subtle inflammatory changes, a subset of patients may not mount the intense inflammatory response that portends severe illness. As this heterogeneity in clinical severity is less likely due to the existence of less virulent strains of SARS-CoV-2, or the protection from adaptive immunity given the novel nature of the virus, the immune response of the host remains the most probable factor in determining disease severity. It is unclear if any specific pattern of gut microbiota protects individuals from mounting a severe inflammatory state when infected with SARS-CoV-2. Kumar et al. highlighted a potential link between the environmental microbiota of a population and the burden of COVID-19. With data from 122 diverse countries, lower COVID-19-associated mortality was observed in countries with a higher percentage of rural population (alluding to higher gut microbial diversity), higher proportion of population residing in slums, and a lower water quality and sanitation score (69). While such observational data can be prone to confounders, these results offer some insight into the potential role of gut microbiota on the disease burden of COVID-19.",
            "There is mounting evidence that being elderly and having a chronic inflammatory state (from chronic medical conditions) predisposes to a pro-dysbiotic state (70, 71). It is unlikely a coincidence that the highest rates of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 have also been observed in the elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions, and among immunosuppressed patients with cancers (5–9). COVID-19 disease severity is likely host dependent and driven by the inflammatory response. In autopsy samples from a patient with severe COVID-19, inflammatory cells were observed in the lungs (72), suggesting an intense inflammatory response (8). Furthermore, studies have also reported elevated plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (57, 73), in severe COVID-19. In patients prone to gut dysbiosis, further inflammatory triggers may tip the balance over to a leaky gut, resulting in a self-perpetuating inflammatory feedback circle. Notably, two small studies showed a direct correlation between severe COVID-19 and gut dysbiosis (62, 63) Another two studies have shown that patients with severe COVID-19 experienced more pronounced GI symptoms, along with higher levels of stool calprotectin (an indicator of GI inflammation and disrupted mucosal integrity) (58, 59). This supports the concept of an immunological crosstalk between the lungs and gut, presumably moderated by the gut microbiota (12). There is still a lack of data assessing the role of gut microbiota in a high-risk cohort (such as elderly or cancer patients) with COVID-19, although a study on the impact of probiotics on health and immunity in elderly and diabetic patients, and response to COVID-19 vaccination, is underway (\nTable 3\n).",
            "Given the association between gut dysbiosis and COVID-19 severity, the therapeutic potential for modulation of the gut microbiome to modify disease outcomes holds promise. However, there is no microbiota-directed therapy that has demonstrated efficacy in preventing the development or progression of COVID-19 currently.",
            "Plant-based fibers exert a prebiotic effect by promoting the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the gut microbiota (e.g., Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp.) while decreasing the proportion of harmful species (e.g., Clostridia) (74). Moreover, the fermentation of soluble dietary fibers by certain bacterial species yields several beneficial metabolites, such as SCFAs, which serve to maintain colonic mucosal integrity and modulate the immune system (75). By-products of SCFAs are also absorbed into the circulatory system and have anti-inflammatory effects. In mice models, a high-fiber diet with elevated SCFA levels was protective against allergic inflammation in the lungs, while a low-fiber diet with decreased SCFA levels resulted in increased allergic airway disease (76). Interestingly, studies from other respiratory diseases have demonstrated a reduction in mortality with intake of whole grains (77, 78). Although the beneficial effects of dietary fibers are intuitive, there is currently no direct evidence that any specific amount or type of dietary fiber is beneficial in COVID-19 illness.",
            "Oral probiotics are live bacteria of specific species that alter the composition of gut microbiota after reaching the intestines (74). A shift to beneficial bacterial species modulates the local and systemic inflammatory balance, with several studies demonstrating a positive impact on respiratory infections and other extra-intestinal illnesses. Using a probiotic bacterium, Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 in mouse models, prevention of infection with respiratory syncytial virus was demonstrated (79). In another study on 30 elderly volunteers, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 ingestion was shown to enhance the cellular immunity (80). Placebo controlled clinical trials with probiotics (using Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterococcus faecalis) have also demonstrated significant improvement in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (81, 82).",
            "Naturally, if dysbiosis is indeed involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, probiotics appear to be among the more convenient, efficient, and potentially safe strategies. After initial reports of gut dysbiosis in patients with severe COVID-19, the National Health Commission (of China) recommended the use of probiotics to maintain gut microbial homeostasis and prevent secondary bacterial infections (83). Given the dearth of data pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 and the relative safety of probiotics, the rapid promulgation in favor of probiotics seems reasonable while awaiting further evidence. Although there is no direct evidence yet showing the efficacy of any specific strain of probiotic against COVID-19, several registered trials are currently examining the therapeutic potential of various probiotics formulations in COVID-19 (\nTable 3\n).",
            "FMT is a process of actively transferring colonies of fecal bacteria from a healthy person into the GIT of another individual. The process aims to restore the composition of gut microbiota back to a healthy state. As mentioned earlier, FMT is an effective therapy for recurrent or refractory C. difficile enterocolitis (84). Given the proposed role of gut microbiota in the abnormal activation of immune responses in the COVID-19, FMT can potentially be explored as a therapeutic strategy. A recent case report (85) described two patients with rapid resolution of COVID-19 after FMT was undertaken to treat concomitant C. difficile infection. However strong may be the hypothesis and surrounding speculations, FMT should not presently be recommended as a therapy against COVID-19 due to the scarcity of large-scale studies. To explore further, a clinical trial (FeMToCOVID) is currently registered at the clinicaltrials.org (NCT04824222), though it has not yet started recruiting patients.",
            "Despite the efficient pace of clinical trials evaluating new and repurposed agents for COVID-19, success has been modest at best. Although still in nascent stages, evolving evidence signals a probable link between gut microbiota and the host’s immune response to COVID-19. However, the exact mechanism and extent of the role of gut dysbiosis in disease severity remain to be elucidated. This is further compounded by the inherent challenges associated with designing microbiome studies. Another possible angle would be to define the state of a leaky gut more clearly with biomarkers and cutoff criteria, to also enable clarification on whether patients who have developed an inflammatory cascade are still amenable to therapeutic gut microbiota modulation.",
            "Besides exploration of any potential role in the management of COVID-19, long-term consequences of gut dysbiosis should also be explored with longitudinal follow-up (\nTable 2\n). A search of ongoing clinical trials at the US National Library of Medicine reveals 24 registered studies assessing microbiota-targeted therapeutic options (\nTable 3\n).",

            "The role of resident gut microbiota in other respiratory illnesses has been well recognized. Furthermore, the brunt of unfavorable COVID-19 outcomes has been on elderly patients and those with chronic medical diseases, both scenarios known to have senescence-driven gut dysbiosis. Increasingly, evidence is mounting for gut dysbiosis as a predisposing factor for severe COVID-19, through a leaky gut phenomenon and resultant spillage of bacterial products and toxins. Evidence is emerging that the degree of dysbiosis correlates with the severity of COVID-19 illness. This behooves us to explore potentially preventive and therapeutic targets, such as dietary intervention and probiotics. Several ongoing trials are evaluating various pathogenic routes and therapeutic approaches. While efforts for direct anti-viral agents and vaccines are of prime significance, the gut–lung axis could still hold therapeutic potential.",

            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused significant mortality and morbidity worldwide. In children, the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is often asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, and life-threatening complications are rare. Nevertheless, there are two long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children that raise concern: multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and long COVID. While the understanding and the experience regarding the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection have remarkably increased over time, scientific and clinical research is still exploring the long-term effects of COVID-19. In children, data on long COVID are scant. Reports are conflicting regarding its prevalence, duration and impact on daily life. This narrative review explored the latest literature regarding long COVID-19 in the pediatric population. We showed that long COVID in children might be a relevant clinical problem. In most cases, the prognosis is good, but some children may develop long-term symptoms with a significant impact on their daily life. The paucity of studies on long COVID, including a control group of children not infected by SARS-CoV-2, prevents us from drawing firm conclusions. Whether the neuropsychiatric symptoms widely observed in children and adolescents with long COVID are the consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or are due to the tremendous stress resulting from the restrictions and the pandemics is still not clear. In both cases, psychological support can play a fundamental role in managing COVID pandemics in children. More knowledge is needed to share a standardized definition of the syndrome and improve its management and treatment.",
            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent responsible for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused significant mortality and morbidity worldwide [1,2,3]. In children, the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is often asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, and life-threatening complications are rare [2]. Nevertheless, despite the low risk of COVID in the short term, there are two long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children that raise concern: multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and long COVID.",
            "MIS-C is a rare phenomenon (to date, 783 cases worldwide have been reported) that occurs in children 2 to 6 weeks after the infection. It develops in less than 0.1% of children with COVID-19 (median age 8.6 years) and requires intensive care support in 68% of cases [3]. MIS-C is associated with marked immune activation and many potential mechanisms of immunopathogenesis. Children present with several multisystemic manifestations with those involving the gastrointestinal tract, skin, mucous membranes and the cardiovascular system reported as the most common. For some aspects, the clinical picture of MIS-C resembles that of Kawasaki disease (KD), especially in cases with shock, toxic shock syndrome and macrophage activation syndrome [4].",
            "The second long-term consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is long COVID. Recent evidence shows that some of the symptoms that characterize the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection may persist despite complete viral clearance both in adults and in children. According to the most recent definition by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), there are several entities determined by SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) acute COVID-19, defined by signs and symptoms up to 4 weeks; (2) post-acute or ongoing symptomatic COVID-19, when symptoms persist from 4 to 12 weeks; (3) post-COVID-19 syndrome, defined by signs and symptoms that continue for more than 12 weeks after onset of acute symptoms. Long COVID includes both post-acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 syndrome [5]. Long COVID is largely studied in adults, mainly those hospitalized [6,7,8], but prevalence, clinical manifestations and treatment are still a matter of study. In a recent systematic review including 250,351 survivors of COVID-19, more than half had at least one residual symptom up to 6 months or more from the infection [7]. In children, data on long COVID are scant. Reports are conflicting regarding its prevalence, duration and impact on daily life. This narrative review aims to explore the latest literature regarding long COVID-19 in the pediatric population.",
            "Since COVID-19 prevalence varies between countries, an accurate prediction of children who will progress to long COVID is difficult to make. Moreover, studies on long COVID are mostly based on self or parent-reported symptoms without an objective clinical evaluation or without a previous proven SARS-CoV-2 infection [9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17].",
            "The prevalence of long COVID-19 in children varies remarkably depending on the studies, ranging from 4% to 66% (Table 1) [18,19,20,21,22,23,24].",
            "Studies are very heterogeneous, differing in sample size, the median age of the included population, duration and modalities of follow-up. In particular, 6 out of the 14 studies reporting on long COVID prevalence conducted a face-to-face assessment in post-COVID-19 dedicated clinics, whereas the remaining studies collected data via online platforms or phone interviews.",
            "One of the first reports on long-COVID in children was a case report of five Swedish children (median age 12 yrs) who had symptoms lasting 6-8 months after the acute infection. None of these patients required hospitalization during the acute phase, but one patient with associated comorbidities required admission after three months because of peri-myocarditis [9].",
            "An Australian study followed 171 children in a dedicated post-COVID-19 clinic: 8% reported post-COVID symptoms up to 8 weeks, and all of them were symptomatic at the time of infection [10].",
            "An Italian cross-sectional study interviewed the parents of 129 children reporting that 66.6% had at least one persisting symptom after 60–120 days from the initial diagnosis, 27.1% after 120 days or more and 42.6% after three months. Surprisingly, even asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases in the acute phase of the infection developed persisting symptoms [11].",
            "A prospective cohort Russian study collected data on 518 children (median age 10.4 yrs, 44.7% with associated comorbidities) affected by COVID-19, and 24.7% of them had at least one persisting symptom after the acute phase with some of the symptoms lasting up to 6–7 months [12].",
            "In Israel, a prospective cohort study collected data from 90 children in a multidisciplinary center for long-COVID. The median number of chronic symptoms was four (1–14), and in almost 60% of patients, symptoms were associated with functional impairment after one to seven months after illness onset [13].",
            "In England and Wales, the VirusWatch study collected data from 4678 children, including children affected by COVID-19 (n = 174) and healthy controls (n = 4504). The monthly survey showed that symptoms lasting for more than four weeks were reported by 4.6% of children with a history of SARS-CoV-2 (8/174) and by 1.7% of controls (72/4504) [14].",
            "Data from 510 children living in the United Kingdom and the United States were collected using an online platform created by an association of parents called LongCOVIDKids. Parents had to fill out an online survey regarding the status of the child before the COVID infection, the characteristic of the acute phase and the persistence of chronic symptoms. In 58.2% of the cases, COVID-19 was confirmed by a microbiological test; in 41%, the infection was suspected only clinically. Only children with symptoms lasting for more than four weeks were included. The median duration of symptoms was 8.2 months; 25.3% had constant long-COVID symptoms, 49.4% had fluctuating symptoms and 19% suffered from returning symptoms after a period of prolonged wellness [15].",
            "Molteni et al. acquired data from children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (n = 1734) and matched negative controls through a mobile application launched by ZOE Global. Parents could report their children status using a questionnaire. Data were collected between March 2020 and February 2021. Of the children who tested positive, the median illness duration was 6 days (vs. 3 days in the matched controls), 4.4% had symptoms lasting more than four weeks and at least for 28 days, with a mean number of symptoms of six in the first week and two at day 28. Only 1,8% was still symptomatic after day 56. Among the matched negative controls, less than 1% was symptomatic for more than 28 days [16]. This prevalence in the UK was recently confirmed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) that reported the prevalence of symptoms 4–8 weeks post-infection as follows: 3.3% in primary-school-aged children and 4.6% in secondary-school aged children, with a matched control group symptom prevalence of 3.6% in primary-school-aged children and 2.9% in secondary-school aged children [17].",
            "One of the latest studies on long-COVID was conducted at the Children’s Clinical University Hospital in Latvia. This cohort study enrolled 236 pediatric COVID-19 patients and 142 comparison group patients to identify the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection 1–6 months after acute infection. After a median follow-up time of 73.5 days, almost 70% of participants had at least one persisting symptom and more than the 50% had two or more [18].",
            "The underlying mechanisms causing the various clinical spectrum of long COVID are still unknown. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is the gateway that SARS-CoV-2 uses to invade the cells of many organs (lungs, heart, brain, oral and nasal mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, spleen, kidney, blood vessel endothelium and others) causing acute damage [25].",
            "The wide ACE2 receptor epithelial expression, as already well documented by pathology studies during the 2004 epidemic caused by SARS-CoV, could explain the variety of symptoms that also characterize long COVID [26]. In patients where the injury induced by the initial viral infection results in persistent symptoms, there might be a combination of the following mechanisms: chronic tissue damage, the persistence of the virus in the organism and dysregulation of the immune system with consequent autoimmunity and chronic inflammation [27].",
            "The altered immunological response seems to play a predominant role. A recent study (not yet peer-reviewed) described the immunological differences between children completely recovered from the acute infection and children with post-acute sequelae (defined as PASC) [28].",
            "This study provided the first objective laboratory evidence of the existence of PASC in children, previously described in adults. Children with PASC (n = 12 of whom three had pre-existing comorbidities, mean age 10.3 ± 4.5 yrs) showed higher levels of plasmablasts, IgD-CD27+ memory and switched IgM-IgD-B cells. On the other hand, the group of children completely recovered (n = 17 of whom three had pre-existing conditions, mean age 7.7 ± 5.5 yrs) had a higher number of naive and unswitched IgM+IgD+ and IgM+CD27-CD38dim B cell subsets, indicating the restoration of B cell homeostasis. Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1, mediators of inflammatory responses and auto-immune processes, were elevated in PASC patients and consistently higher than in recovered children suggesting the predominant role of the innate immune system.",
            "According to the model proposed above, in the alveoli, after the initial damage to the blood–lung barrier, chronic inflammation with continuous production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) may occur, followed by their release into surrounding tissues and bloodstream. This process can lead to the activation of complement, platelets and platelet–leukocyte interactions with further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and impaired coagulation [27]. Abnormalities in coagulation can increase the risk of microthrombosis in multiple organs but especially in alveolar capillaries (given the extremely rich expression of ACE2 receptor in lungs and blood vessels endothelium) with consequent hypoxemia, tissue hypoxia and eventually dyspnea, as described in the adult population [29,30]. Therefore, the prolonged hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable state can increase the risk of thrombosis, which may partly explain the common respiratory symptoms complained by patients with long COVID.",
            "All these aspects were well exemplified by a case report on a 14-year-old girl initially diagnosed with mild COVID-19 infection in October 2020. Due to persisting symptoms, she was hospitalized 7 months later. Laboratory investigations were suggestive of a pro-inflammatory state (high level of IL-6, IL-1, TNF-α, unusual B-cell and regulatory T-cell patterns, low concentrations of CD27+ memory B lymphocytes), high concentrations of IgA and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) showed mild pulmonary hypertension.",
            "The recent similar approach used in adults with long-term COVID-19 sequelae and the finding of pulmonary hypertension, guided the investigators to perform pulmonary scintigraphy and ventilation–perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (V/Q SPECT), the gold-standard screening test in the assessment of chronic thromboembolism. Whereas planar scintigraphy did not show areas with decreased radiopharmaceutical uptake in both lungs, V/Q SPECT showed significant perfusion defect in the apical segment of the right upper lobe, with no correspondent parenchymal alterations on co-registered CT slices. These findings could be explained by microvascular and endothelial damage, and this was the first reported evidence of organ dysfunction in an adolescent with PASC [31,32].",
            "Interestingly, in a small percentage of adult patients, a pro-fibrotic state can be observed: the released cytokines, especially IL-6, along with activation of fibroblasts following acute damage, can lead to deposition of collagen and fibronectin and lead to long-term fibrotic abnormalities [33,34]. Further studies are needed to better characterize the pro-fibrotic state and the underlying mechanisms in children, along with a better comprehension of the sequelae [35].",
            "As seen for the lung, in the heart, the endothelial damage and the microthrombosis can lead to abnormalities in coagulation pathways. Fibrotic changes are possibly favored by prolonged immune activation and accompanied by an increase in cardiac fibromyoblasts. The chronic inflammation of cardiomyocytes can result in myositis and cause cardiomyocytes death due to an intense local immune response [27]. Furthermore, specific cardiovascular dysfunction of the afferent autonomic nervous system (caused by the combination of infection, autonomic nervous system pro-inflammatory response and autoimmunity) can lead to complications such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) [36].",
            "In the central nervous system, the infection may occur by haematogenic or neuronal retrograde routes; even the blood–brain barrier may be affected by the infection, causing chronic neuroinflammation [27]. The long-term immune response can activate glial cells, which chronically damage neurons, and the abnormalities of coagulation may lead to an increased risk of thrombotic events. The blood–brain barrier dysregulation can then allow cytokines and leukocytes to infiltrate the brain parenchyma, and the effect of chronic neuroinflammation in the brainstem could be the basis of autonomic dysfunction [37]. All these mechanisms can lead to the multiple neurological manifestations (such as cognitive impairment) ascertained in patients with long COVID.",
            "The gastroenteric tract is a frequent target of SARS-CoV2 infection, given the elevated expression of ACE2 receptors along the mucosa but also in other organs (pancreas, liver, spleen). Although the exact mechanism is still not fully understood, it is highly probable that the direct attack of SARS-CoV-2 is relevant in causing gastrointestinal symptoms either in COVID-19 or in long COVID, always referring to the proposed model in Figure 1 [27]. The pathogenetic steps leading to the persisting gastrointestinal symptoms may be diffuse tissue damage of the bowel leading to enterocytes desquamation, edema and small bowel dilation, immune dysregulation with lymphocytes infiltration, microthrombosis and necrosis [38,39].",
            "Finally, one of the most frequently described symptoms in long COVID is fatigue. The most likely hypothesis involves the simultaneous presence of central, peripheral and psychological factors [26]. The already cited chronic neuroinflammation, along with neuromuscular mechanisms of injury (such as damages involving sarcolemma), may result in long-term fatigue, but non-well determined psychological and social factors might play a part.",
            "Proposed mechanisms implicated in manifestations of long COVID in different organs are shown in Figure 1.",
            "Future research might focus more on bio-humoral aspects, especially on cytokine storm, which seems to play a significant role especially when compared to similar problems encountered in past epidemics [40]. However, as we have seen, studies were carried out mainly in adults and data on pediatric patients are still lacking. Many mechanisms appear to be similar in adults and children, but targeted studies are needed to better understand the pathophysiology of long COVID in children [41].",
            "The clinical manifestations of long-COVID are highly variable in symptoms, intensity and duration. The signs and symptoms resumed in Table 2, can occur both alone and in combination, can be transient or intermittent, can change over time or remain constant. The range of clinical manifestations reported in the different studies is quite wide, highlighting the heterogeneity in clinical presentation.",
            "Although long COVID manifestations seem to be more common in children with symptomatic or severe acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, they are also described in asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients [15].",
            "The few studies conducted in children demonstrated the same symptoms of long-COVID reported in the adult population.",
            "As in adults [42], the most common symptom described in children was fatigue, reported in up to 87% of patients [9,10,11,12,15,18,20]. Some authors [20] highlighted that fatigue could be determined by the limitations in daily activities due to school unattendance. However, this datum is difficult to verify in the absence of a control group.",
            "In a five-patient case series on long-COVID, Ludvigsson et al. reported that all children complained of fatigue for 6–8 months, and none were able to go back to school full time [9].",
            "In an Italian study, parents reported that most children affected by COVID-19 showed a certain impairment in physical activity due to fatigue: after 4 weeks from the acute infection, 30.2% experienced a worsening of the symptoms in case of physical activity and 21.2% could not practice any. Only 11.8% of children returned to previous levels of physical activity [15]. However, as mentioned above, restrictive measures might have contributed to these results.",
            "To date, six studies compared children infected with COVID-19 and a control group [14,16,18,19,21,23] and four [14,16,18,23] reported a higher prevalence of symptoms in children affected by COVID, suggesting long COVID syndrome.",
            "The cohort study conducted by Roge et al. at the Children’s Clinical University Hospital in Latvia compared children previously affected by SARS-CoV-2 (19 children) and children with other non-SARS-CoV-2 community-acquired infections. Overall, 70% of patients complained of at least one persistent symptom and 54% of multiple persistent symptoms. The persistence of at least one symptom [fatigue (25.2%), irritability (24.3%), mood changes (23.3%), headaches (16.9%), rhinorrhea (16.1%), coughing (14.4%), anosmia/dysgeusia (12.3%)] was more frequent in patients with COVID-19 infection (70% vs. 24.8%, p-value < 0.001). Interestingly, school-age children and adolescents were mostly affected by cognitive and neurological disorders while infants and preschoolers by respiratory problems [18].",
            "Stephenson et al. [23], in The Children and Young People with long COVID (Clock) study, interviewed with a questionnaire 3065 children aged 11–17 years tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and a total of 3793 age-, sex- and geographicaly matched SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. Three months after the test, the most common neuropsychiatric symptom was a headache with a higher prevalence in the group of the subjects who tested positive for COVID (23.2% vs. 14.2%); no difference was reported in mental health, wellbeing, quality of life and fatigue.",
            "Blankenburg et al. [19] enrolled a total of 1560 students (median age, 15 yrs), of which 1365 (88%) were seronegative for COVID-19 and 188 (12%) seropositive. The children were asked to complete a validated questionnaire with 12 questions on the occurrence and frequency of pain and relevant neurocognitive or mood symptoms within the last seven days. Each symptom was documented in about 35% of the students without difference between the two groups. Unhappiness (98.7%), tenseness (86.4%), listlessness (80.7%) and difficulties in concentrating (79.3%) were the most common reported issues.",
            "Overall, neuropsychiatric symptoms appear to be very common in children after the infection with COVID-19.",
            "In the first study regarding long COVID in children [11], insomnia (18.6%), headache (10.1%) and concentration difficulties (10.1%) were among the most frequently reported symptoms both in symptomatic and asymptomatic children during the acute phase of the infection, and these persisted in 42.6% of cases 120 days after the diagnosis.",
            "The Swedish five-patient case series highlighted the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms of long COVID up to 8 months since the infection. Headaches, difficulties concentrating and dizziness were reported in four patients, memory loss and depression in three patients and sleep disorders in two patients. In addition, two out of five children had seen, or were scheduled to see, a psychologist [9].",
            "In an Italian study, Buonsenso et al. performed a comprehensive assessment of parents’ perspectives derived from an online survey in order to establish long-term physical and mental health outcomes in 510 children with persisting symptoms after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The authors focused on reported symptoms, their dynamics and the overall changes in children’s activities and mental health. Overall, the mean duration of symptoms was 8.2 months with a significant prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as headache (78.6%), lack of concentration (60.6%), unexplained irritability (51.4%) and dizziness (48%), difficulty remembering information (45.9%), difficulty in doing everyday tasks (40%), difficulty processing information (32.7%) and short-term memory issues (32.7%). In addition, most parents reported changes in energy levels (83.3%), mood (58.8%), sleep (56.3%) and appetite (49.6%). In 25.3% of cases, children suffered from persistent symptoms; in 49.4%, there was a period of apparent recovery after the infection, and then symptoms returned, and in 19%, symptoms appeared after a prolonged period of wellbeing [15].",
            "Further characterization of symptoms belonging to the neuropsychiatric sphere was described in children after COVID infection by a survey conducted by Brackel et al. among Dutch pediatricians. Eighty-nine children aged 2–18 years with various disorders ascribed to long COVID were identified. Many patients reported cognitive dysfunctions (45% concentrating difficulties, 13% memory loss, 2% brain fog) and headaches (38%). Furthermore, 48% and 36% of children reported mild or severe limitations, respectively, in daily routine and school attendance. Of note, 16% of subjects were seen by a psychologist [20].",
            "Osmanov et al. conducted one study in a cohort of 518 subjects previously hospitalized for COVID-19, assessing symptoms prevalence and duration of long COVID using the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) COVID-19 Paediatric follow-up questionnaire. After fatigue (10.6%), sleep disturbances were the second most frequent symptom (7.2%), followed by sensory problems (6.2%). Regarding the decline of symptoms over time, smell disturbances declined faster than headache and sleep problems. This finding may be attributable to a psychological mechanism rather than to an effect of the viral infection. Moreover, parents thought that COVID-19 illness, and not to the pandemic in general, was the cause of reduced appetite (4.5%), reduced (3.5%) or augmented (2%) sleeping, reduced physical activity (4.7%) and reduced emotions (4.3%) [12].",
            "In another study conducted in Iran on 58 children and adolescents previously admitted to the hospital with a COVID-19 diagnosis, sleep difficulty (5%) and headaches (5%) were the most frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms 3 months after discharge [43].",
            "However, the variability of symptoms in patients with long COVID-19 is wide. Miller et al., in their household cohort study on 4678 children, showed that long COVID could affect all systems: eye–nose–throat symptoms (22.5%) were the most common after fatigue (27.5%), followed by symptoms affecting the respiratory (21.2%), neurological (16.2%), dermatological (15%), gastrointestinal (13.8%), cardiovascular (11.2%), psychiatric (10%) and muscular (8.8%) system [14].",
            "In a recent systematic review on long COVID symptoms, 14 studies heterogeneous for design, inclusion criteria, outcomes and follow-up were included. The prevalence of long COVID symptoms in the included children (n = 19.426) ranged from 4 to 66%. The most common symptoms were headache (3–80%), fatigue (3–87%), concentration difficulties (2–81%), sleep disturbance (2–63%), abdominal pain (1–76%) and myalgia or arthralgia (1–61). In the majority of the studies, all symptoms did not persist longer than 12 weeks. The wide variability shown in symptoms ‘prevalence might be caused by some limitations of the included studies such as the different ages of the subjects, the lack of a unique definition of long COVID, the absence in some cases of objective clinical evaluations, the low response rates to questionnaires in asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic subjects and the absence of control groups [44].",
            "Further studies with more subjects and negative control groups are needed to establish whether the features associated with long COVID are related to the viral infection or to the effects of lockdown, school closures and social isolation [23].",
            "Risk factors for long COVID in children were investigated in a few studies.",
            "Osmanov et al. reported that older age was significantly associated with persistent symptoms, with children above 6 years of age being at higher risk [12]. Molteni et al. described illness duration in a large cohort of symptomatic school-aged children tested for SARS-CoV-2 and reached similar conclusions reporting that children older than 12 years were more likely to manifest symptoms over the following 28 days (5.1% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.046); this evidence was not confirmed over the following 56 days (2% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.52) [16]. Other studies showed a positive correlation between increasing age and long COVID symptoms [13,14,19,23].",
            "Female sex was described as another risk factor for long COVID by three recent studies [14,19,23].",
            "Allergic disease has also been described as a possible risk factor for long COVID in children [12]. Similarly, studies in adults reported that asthma was associated with a higher risk of developing long COVID [6,45]. This can be explained by mast cell activation syndrome and the Th2 based immunological response, mechanisms overexpressed in patients with allergic disease.",
            "Data on long-term pulmonary impairment in children with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection are conflicting. Denina et al. observed that patients with abnormalities at lung ultrasound during hospitalization showed complete normalization within 5 weeks [46].",
            "On the other hand, Ashkenazi-Hoffnung et al. showed mild radiologic and spirometric changes in more than half of their patients in follow-up for long COVID [13].",
            "Further studies might be useful in order to define the risk of persistent impaired respiratory function after SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.",
            "Data indicate that long COVID in children is a real problem. This means that all children with suspected or documented COVID-19 infection and their parents, even if asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, must be informed about the possible persistence of symptoms for more than 4 weeks and about the possible reappearance after the acute phase with the same or different characteristics. Adolescents, females and children with underlying diseases, including mental health, should be particularly warned because they are at increased risk of long COVID. However, present knowledge of the characteristics of pediatric long COVID is largely incomplete, and this makes it difficult to indicate which is the most rational approach to this condition in children.",
            "Considering the multi-organ involvement seen in long COVID, a multidisciplinary team is mandatory in the follow-up of these patients. In Figure 2, we propose a stepwise approach for screening, assessing and monitoring children infected by COVID 19.",
            "According to the recommendations of NICE, the first step can be a questionnaire to determine the acute phase of the disease and assess the most common symptoms of long COVID [5]. Questionnaires such as the COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation Screen (C19-YRS) [47] or the questionnaire developed by the Swiss COVID Study Group and the Swiss Society for Pulmonology (SSP) were used to address the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary long COVID in adult patients [48]. Conversely, no specific and standardized questionnaires are available for the pediatric population.",
            "Studies demonstrated that immediately after the acute phase of COVID-19 infection (4–12 weeks), a very small number of children presented symptoms; mostly physical symptoms. During this period, all children who were previously infected with COVID-19 were examined by the general pediatrician and further investigations were prescribed on an individual basis.",
            "Depending on their clinical history and physical examination, children can enter a second phase that includes pulmonary assessment. In adults, pulmonary assessment is recommended in discharged patients with persistent respiratory symptoms [49]. The British Thoracic Society recommends chest X rays 3 months after discharge for all adult patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 infection, particularly in those with a history of moderate or severe disease; patients with persistent symptoms or radiological abnormalities are offered further clinical referrals and investigations [50]. In children, pulmonary assessment can include various lung function tests and further investigations depending on reported symptoms and clinical history; some patients may require medical treatment such as bronchodilators or inhaled steroids.",
            "A single pediatric study conducted in Israel on 90 children with persistent symptoms found mild radiologic and spirometric changes in more than half of the patients. Conversely, none of the children exhibited abnormal findings on echocardiography, raising the question of whether this investigation is necessary for children with normal echocardiography and no story of MIS-C [13].",
            "Step 3 includes the monitoring phase with visits and lung function measurements at 3, 6 and 12 months, depending on the patient’s impairment.",
            "In conclusion, we think that primary care pediatricians should visit all subjects with a suspected or a proven diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 4 weeks to check for the presence of symptoms of a previously unknown disease. In any case, a further check-up by the primary care pediatrician should be scheduled 3 months after the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection to confirm normality or to address emerging problems. The subsequent approach to the individual case will have to be evaluated on the basis of the present symptoms.",
            "While the understanding and the experience regarding the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection have remarkably increased over time, scientific and clinical research is still exploring the long-term effects of COVID-19, particularly in children. Long COVID in children might be a relevant clinical problem. In most cases, the prognosis is good, but some children may develop long-term symptoms with a significant impact on their daily life. The paucity of studies on long COVID, including a control group of children not infected by SARS-CoV-2, prevents us from drawing firm conclusions. Whether the neuropsychiatric symptoms widely observed in children and adolescents with long COVID are the consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or are due to the tremendous stress resulting from the restrictions and the pandemics is still not clear. In both cases, psychological support can play a fundamental role in managing COVID pandemics in children.",
            "More knowledge is needed to: (1) recognize the true prevalence of long COVID in children; (2) better understand phenotype and pathogenesis of this disease; (3) share a standardized definition of the syndrome; (4) improve management and treatment; (5) analyze the impact of different viral variants on long COVID in pediatrics. In the meantime, vaccination in children and adolescents appears crucial to protect them from the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies could evaluate the impact of COVID vaccination on long COVID prevalence.",

            "The aim of this review was to analyze COVID-19 effect on the biological features of suicidal vulnerability and its interaction with suicide-related biological pathways. We carried out a narrative review of international publications on the interactions of COVID-19 with the biological bases of suicide.",
            "We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 interacts with multiple biological processes that underlie suicidal behavior, such as the renin-angiotensin system, nicotinic receptors, and central and systemic inflammation. Social distancing measures may also worsen subjective or objective social disconnection, thus increasing the risk of suicide. Interestingly, the drugs used to prevent suicide could be promising options to counteract brain damage caused by this coronavirus.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 interacts with multiple biological pathways involved in suicide and opens a new window for understanding the suicidal process. The development of suicide prevention treatments in the context of a pandemic may benefit from knowledge on these interactions.",
            "The first human cases of infection by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were identified in the city of Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. Today, with more than 100,000,000 individuals diagnosed worldwide [1], the COVID-19 outbreak has reached a large part of the world population.",
            "Besides the respiratory symptoms, the pandemic might have an emotional impact and might favor the emergence or worsening of psychiatric symptoms in people with COVID-19 or with a specific vulnerability to mental disorders [2]. Indeed, during the previous SARS pandemic, people developed psychological symptoms due to the quarantine, or psychological stress linked to the fear of contamination. For instance, in Canada, a significant proportion of the 1057 individuals confined during the SARS epidemic reported fear symptoms (20%), sadness (18%), and even feeling of guilt (10%) [3]. Some of these symptoms persisted after 3 years of follow-up: substance use, alcohol dependence, or post-traumatic stress disorder [4]. During the current pandemic, more than 29% of patients with COVID-19 developed depressive symptoms in the province of Guangdong [5]. Moreover, around 20% of patients with a pre-existing psychiatric disorder reported worsening of their psychological state and interruption of psychiatric care during the pandemic [6]. The negative psychological impact was severe in psychiatric patients, particularly for anger, impulsivity, and suicidal ideation [7]. It was also suggested that young-old people may be at risk of increased depressive symptoms and suicidal acts [8].",
            "The psychosocial stress imposed by the society changes in response to this pandemic may increase the vulnerability to suicidal behaviors at several levels. Social isolation, resulting from the quarantine imposed to more than a half of the world population, is a well-known risk factor for suicide [9]. Quarantine may worsen the risk of domestic violence and limit the possibilities of psychological support [10]. The announced economic crisis also is likely to influence suicide rates [11]. It has been estimated that the related rise of unemployment will lead to more suicides (up to 9570 additional suicides per year) [12]. Therefore, an increase of suicide rates, as observed during the Spanish “flu” pandemic (1918), is expected [13]. Consequently, the present pandemic is a source of concern in populations facing psychosocial stressors. In many vulnerable people, the emotional, social, health, and financial consequences of this pandemic could lead to mental health problems and suicidal behaviors, in the immediate aftermath and also in the longer term. The scientific and mental health communities should proactively prepare and use this challenging period to improve suicide research and prevention.",
            "Recent biological data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the central nervous system (CNS) [14] through biological pathways implicated in suicidal behaviors: renin-angiotensin system, inflammation system, and nicotine receptors. Social distancing measures also are leading to neurobiological changes involved in suicidal behavior, such as inflammation [15]. A better understanding of the connections between COVID-19 pathophysiology and the biology of suicide is the first step to address suicide prevention and to propose effective treatments in a pandemic context.",
            "In this review, we propose to highlight the possible biological mechanisms through which COVID-19 may influence suicidal vulnerability and increase the risk of suicidal acts. A better understanding of this link may help to identify the populations at risk and to monitor patients with the highest suicidal risk in an adequate time window, depending on the mid- and long-term neuropsychiatric consequences. We also discuss how the COVID-19 outbreak may help to better understand the neural and biological correlates of suicidal behavior. Finally, we focus on interactions between the psychotropic medications used to treat suicidal patients and COVID-19 and discuss how these drugs might limit the inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Studies on respiratory viral infections have identified an association between infection and risk for suicide. Specifically, mood disorders have been associated with the presence of antibodies against influenza A and B viruses and a coronavirus strain (HCov-NL63) [16]. Influenza B seropositivity has been significantly associated with history of suicide attempt (OR = 2.53, CI 1.33–4.80). In general, exposure to infectious agents is an aggravating factor for the risk of self-harm [17]. This study, based on the analysis of Danish registers, showed that individuals with infections are at greater risk of deliberate self-harm compared with controls (hazard rate ratio: 1.80 (95% CI = 1.68–1.91)). Redeemed prescriptions for anti-infective medications were considered as a proxy for infection. In addition, this association depended on the infection severity, as indicated by the higher suicide risk in individuals hospitalized for infections (hazard rate ratio: 3.13 (95% CI = 1.67–5.87)) [17]. The underlying causes are multiple, including inflammatory changes [18], and microbiota modification secondary to the use of anti-infective agents and its influence on the CNS [19••]. Several mechanisms might be at work in the infection-related brain damage: retrograde axonal transport of the virus from the respiratory mucosa [14], peripheral inflammation that modulates brain function, and migration of mononuclear cells transporting the virus across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [14]. Finally, some studies suggested that antiviral agents also could influence mood disorders, as summarized in Table 1.Table 1Main treatments tested in ongoing trials in patients with COVID-19 for which there are data on mood disorders and suicide risk [156, 157]TreatmentTypeMechanism of actionEffect on mood disorder and suicide riskChloroquineAntimalarialEndosomal acidification, fusion inhibitor, anti-inflammatory activityNo direct effect on suicide, but increased risk of depression [158]HydroxychloroquineAntimalarialEndosomal acidification, fusion inhibitor, anti-inflammatory activityIncreased risk of depression and suicidal ideation [159]LopinavirAntiviralProtease inhibitorInconclusive data, but effects on mood disorders [160–163]RitonavirAntiviralProtease inhibitorInconclusive data, but effects on mood disorders [160–163]OseltamivirAntiviralPotent and selective inhibitor of neuraminidaseInconclusive data, but possible effects on mood disorders [164–166]InterferonsAntiviralInhibition of viral RNA transcription, protein translation, and post-translational modification: suppress virus replicationSignificant increased risk of depression, suicidal behavior [167, 168]TocilizumabmAbHumanized mAb against IL-6Significant improvement of depressive symptomatology (from randomized controlled trials in depressed patients) [169–171]SarilumabmAbHumanized mAb against IL-6Significant improvement of depressive symptomatology (from randomized controlled trials in depressed patients) [169–171]AnakinramAbHuman IL-1 receptor antagonistPossible positive effect on depression [172]AdalimumabmAbHumanized mAb against TNFαSignificant improvement of depressive symptomatology (from randomized controlled trials in depressed patients) [169–171]CorticosteroidsCorticosteroidsDampen pro-inflammatory cytokinesIncreased risk of mood disorders and possibly of suicidal behavior [173–175]",
            "Main treatments tested in ongoing trials in patients with COVID-19 for which there are data on mood disorders and suicide risk [156, 157]",
            "Suicide attempts, completed suicides, and respiratory viruses share seasonal patterns. Human coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus have a peak incidence during the winter months [20], immediately followed by suicide (especially violent suicide), the incidence of which is maximal in spring and early summer [21]. Only some types of respiratory enteroviruses have a peak overlapping with suicide [20]. Although a link between the annual fluctuations of suicidal acts and infections has not been demonstrated yet, they might share some determinants that follow seasonal patterns, such as the host immune characteristics. Maes et al. (1996) showed that the violent suicide peak is synchronized with variations of the CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio [22] and number of CD20+ B cells that are involved in viral immunity [23, 24]. Interestingly, CD4+ and CD8+ cell concentrations are decreased in patients with COVID-19 [25]. Finally, chronic low-grade inflammation induced by infection may increase suicide risk in the months after the viral peak incidence [26]. Therefore, in the period following the pandemic peak, the populations at risk should be closely monitored due to the effect of seasonal cyclicity, chronic immune response, and delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae [14].",
            "The most recent research on COVID-19 has shown that the virus enters host cells through interaction of its spike protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor that is expressed at the cell surface [27, 28, 29]. ACE-2 is broadly expressed in human cells, including gastrointestinal, heart, and alveolar cells [30], and CNS [31]. Consequently, concern has been raised on the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) because they might increase ACE-2 expression, particularly in the cardiovascular system and CNS [31, 32], and facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry [30, 33].",
            "Interestingly, previous studies established the implication of the renin-angiotensin system in suicidal vulnerability, particularly the use of ARB. In a study in which 964 people who died by suicide were matched with 3856 controls, the risk of suicide death was higher in ARB users than in ACEI users (OR: 1.63; 95%CI, 1.33–2.00) [34, 35]. Furthermore, the presence of the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism has been associated with suicidal behavior in two independent case-control studies [36, 37]. Specifically, the ACE D/D genotype was associated with higher suicide risk (OR: 2.4, 95% CI 1.2–4.8 and OR: 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.7, in each cohort). D allele carriers have higher ACE serum levels than I allele carriers [38]. Another study reported the association between this ACE polymorphism and suicidal behavior in Japanese males [36]. Similarly, Baghai et al. found an association between the single nucleotide polymorphism rs4291 in ACE promoter region and unipolar depression in two independent case-control samples that included, in total, 843 unrelated patients with unipolar depression and 1479 healthy controls [39]. In addition, the higher plasma concentrations of ACE linked to the presence of the D/D genotype promote the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity in depressed individuals [40]. The D/D genotype has been associated also with bipolar disorders and psychotic symptoms in bipolar patients [41], all risk factors for suicide. ACE genetic variants have been detected in older people who meet criteria for depressive disorder and were associated with higher cortisol secretion [42].",
            "Although SARS-CoV-2 targets the ACE-2 receptor, both homologous enzymes (ACE and ACE-2) act in brain cells through a shared enzymatic cascade (angiotensin II is produced by ACE and is an ACE-2 substrate), intracellular gene regulation, and nitric oxide release [31]. SARS-CoV-2 has neuro-invasive potential [43] and could enter the CNS by targeting the ACE-2 receptors that are widely expressed in the brain and BBB [44]. The virus decreases ACE-2 activity [45], and this might unbalance ACE/ACE-2 metabolic pathways. This could affect the vulnerability to suicide in individuals who carry the “risky” ACE genotypes. Moreover, ACE-2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2 might interfere with monoamine synthesis in the brain, for instance, dopamine [46], that is implicated in mood disorders and suicidal behaviors. Hence, the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection might increase suicidal vulnerability through the renin-angiotensin system should be explored in future studies.",
            "Interestingly, a recent review suggests that nicotine might interfere with the renin-angiotensin system [47].",
            "A large body of evidence supports the existence of strong relationships between tobacco consumption and suicidal behaviors. In a study on 347 psychiatric patients, smokers were more likely to attempt suicide (OR: 2.60, 95% CI 1.60–4.23) compared with non-smokers, even after adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical data [48]. A meta-analysis reported that current smokers are at greater risk of suicidal ideation, plans, attempts, and completed suicide [49]. This association could be explained by an impairment of serotonin function by smoking [50]. The link between nicotine intake and monoamine dysfunction is suggested by the pre-synaptic localization of nicotinic cholinergic receptors on catecholamine and serotonin axons [51]. Furthermore, nicotine administration in murine models decreases serotoninergic transmission in the hippocampus and reduces firing of serotoninergic neurons in the midbrain [48, 52]. In parallel to its direct effect on suicide, the acetylcholine system is closely related to depression that in turn increases the vulnerability to suicidal acts and might be deregulated by alterations in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling [53].",
            "Recent reports showed that the nicotinic cholinergic system is dysregulated in patients with COVID-19 [54], and tobacco exposure has been associated with disease progression [55]. In addition, structural studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might enter the CNS by binding to nicotinic receptors [56]. According to the “nicotinic hypothesis,” SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains a motif that is homologous to the neurotoxin-like region that is found in the rabies virus that acts as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor blocker. Hence, through its interaction with the cholinergic system, SARS-CoV-2 might interfere again with suicidal vulnerability.",
            "ACE-2 expression in bronchial epithelial cells is higher in smokers than non-smokers [57]. Moreover, nicotine upregulates ACE and its subsequent metabolic cascade in the CNS and downregulates ACE-2, further unbalancing the brain renin-angiotensin system [58, 59]. In addition, nicotinic receptors contribute to the pathophysiology of inflammation and modulate the inflammatory response, including the secretion of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) [60] that have been associated with depressive phenotypes [61] and suicidal vulnerability [62]. Altogether, the interconnexions of these different pathways show that nicotinic receptors may participate in the association between COVID-19 and suicidal behavior. However, this relationship may be modulated by a specific infection profile in smokers that has to be determined.",
            "Following the viral invasion phase, SARS-CoV-2 induces a cytokine “storm” in a subgroup of patients that dramatically worsen their clinical outcome [63]. This is accompanied by the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNFα, and IL-1 [63, 64]. Cytokine release syndrome leads also to an increase of the serum levels of cytokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), and IL-2 receptor and a decrease of the CD4+/CD8+ ratio [25, 65]. COVID-19-related inflammation may also extend to the CNS through BBB breakdown, viral neuro-invasion, and cytokine secretion [66]. In the brain, SARS-CoV-2 infection can initiate chronic low-grade inflammation that alters cognitive functions and induces neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration [26], thus preparing the ground for psychiatric disorders.",
            "Studies have reported an association between baseline blood level of cytokines and brain activation in psychiatric populations. For example, the basal level of peripheral IL-1 and IL-2 modulates the activation of cerebral networks dedicated to emotion regulation (anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex, and insula) [67] in patients with history of depression. In line with the link between peripheral inflammatory markers and emotion processing, several studies have established an association between basal low-grade systemic inflammation and suicidal behaviors [68]. Indeed, CRP blood level has been associated with suicide attempts [69] and with the intensity of suicidal ideation [70]. Two meta-analyses reported increased concentration of IL-1𝛽 and IL-6 in the blood and in the brain samples from people who died by suicide [71] and reduced IL-2 plasma levels in suicidal patients [18].",
            "Interestingly, IL-6 plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2-related inflammation [65], particularly patients with severe COVID-19 [72]. IL-6 has been linked to psychological dimensions that underlie the suicidal process (e.g., impulsivity and the choice of violent suicide attempt method) [73] and may cause depressive disorders [74]. Moreover, IL-2 receptor increase has been related to COVID-19 [25] and vulnerability to suicide [75].",
            "Some studies have highlighted the implication of monocytes in SARS-CoV infection as host cells for viral replication [76], and through the regulation of immune-related genes, and induction of monocyte-associated immune response [77] that may be a starting point for the inflammatory storm. Monocytes are implicated also in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders and suicidal behaviors. Indeed, monocyte trafficking within the CNS increases in stress conditions, provides information on the peripheral immune state, and amplifies the behavioral stress response [78]. Monocyte trafficking also activates microglia, and microglial hyperactivation, especially in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula, has been detected in patients with suicidal thoughts [79••]. Microglial activation is also induced by peripheral inflammation first within the circumventricular organs, leptomeninges, and choroid plexus and then throughout the CNS [78]. Interestingly, the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio in peripheral blood samples has been associated with age at first suicide attempt [80], and activated monocytes are more likely to be detected in plasma from patients with depression [81]. Higher monocyte count and increased IL-6 level were observed in patients at risk for suicide [82].",
            "Importantly, it has been proposed that the rapid action of ketamine (NMDA antagonist) significantly reduces depression and suicidal ideation through the decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokines [83]. Its antidepressant effect partially relies on modulation of the immune response: reduction of circulating classical pro-inflammatory monocytes and increase of alternative M2 macrophages [81]. Finally, some anti-inflammatory agents (such as anti-IL6 antibodies) that are currently tested in COVID-19 have shown efficacy in individuals with mood disorders (Table 1). These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may potentially impair the brain immune system underlying the suicidal process.",
            "In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection and suicidal risk are associated with modifications of the HPA axis function. Reports on previous coronavirus outbreaks have highlighted a possible interaction between coronaviruses and cortisol secretion [84]. Indeed, SARS-CoV (a coronavirus that shares high similarities with SARS-CoV-2) expresses sequences that mimic the host adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This results in the fixation of host antibodies on ACTH and blunting of cortisol secretion [85]. Moreover, SARS-CoV might also cause hypophysis dysfunction, resulting in HPA axis under-activation and hypocortisolism, which was observed in 39% of SARS-CoV survivors [86]. Although there is no direct evidence of impaired cortisol secretion in patients with COVID-19, HPA axis dysfunction is a potential consequence of this viral disease that might affect suicidal vulnerability. Indeed, blunted cortisol secretion is observed in patients with depression and lifetime history of suicide attempts [87]. Moreover, decreased cortisol secretion may precede a suicidal act [88]. The dexamethasone suppression profile may help to predict the most lethal suicidal acts during a 2-year follow-up [89]. Finally, patients at risk of suicide may show higher susceptibility to HPA dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection because the virus targets the ACE-2 and the ACE/ACE-2 balance that is associated with HPA dysregulation in depressed individuals [40, 42].",
            "Human beings are social creatures: people survive and thrive by connecting with others. Currently, people around the globe have been urged to self-isolate and refrain from social interactions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk of suicide may also be increased by the social consequences of the pandemic and the related lockdown: loneliness and social isolation, stigmatization and social rejection, and increase of interpersonal difficulties (e.g., domestic violence). Reynolds et al. found that loneliness was reported by 38.5% (95% CI 35.5–41.5) and social isolation by 60.6% (95% CI 57.6–63.6) of individuals (n = 1057) quarantined during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Canada [3]. Moreover, SARS-related studies revealed that 9.7% to 48.7% of people experienced stigmatization, abandonment, and isolation. A study on Ebola survivors showed that stigmatization concerned not only survivors or people related to a survivor [90] but also people of a specific nationality or place of residency. Recently, the WHO warned that since the COVID-19 outbreak, Chinese are victims of xenophobia and social stigmatization, with immense levels of threats online and during public interactions.",
            "Feelings of isolation arise as a result of being quarantined [90]. Social isolation exacerbates personal and collective vulnerabilities, while limiting the accessible and familiar support options [10]. A recent review by Calati et al. (2019) suggests that social isolation (i.e., objective physical separation from other people) and loneliness (i.e., subjective distressed feeling of being alone or separated) are strongly associated with suicidal outcomes [9]. Being alone and negative family events increase suicidal ideation in recent suicide attempters. Feeling socially isolated or rejected leads to hypersensitivity to social threats [91] and increases negative relationships. At the biological level, loneliness and situations of social exclusion have been associated with increased HPA activity [91] and inflammation [92], two pathways related to suicidality [18, 71, 88]. Lonely individuals show stronger activation of the ventral striatum to pleasant pictures of objects compared with equally pleasant pictures of people, whereas the opposite is observed in non-lonely subjects. A functional circuit involving the striatal-anterior cortical midline structure plays a role in the expression of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation [93]. In addition, loneliness has a mediating effect on the relation between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume and attitudes toward suicide [94]. The regional gray matter volume of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region involved in suicidal vulnerability, is higher in lonely individuals [95]. A review [96] on 28 fMRI studies during the Cyberball Game, a validated paradigm to study social exclusion, found several cerebral regions involved in exclusion: insula (anterior and posterior), prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex (anterior and posterior), and temporal lobe. Dysregulation of insula and supramarginal gyrus during the exclusion versus the inclusion condition has been associated with suicidal vulnerability [97••]. These cerebral changes may affect emotional regulation, executive functions, and social cognition.",
            "Since the COVID-19 outbreak, an increase in calls to domestic violence services has been observed in many countries [98]. It suggests an intensification of interpersonal conflicts, romantic difficulties, and child maltreatment. Indeed, the forced proximity changes the content of social interactions and may undermine the psychological resources, thus increasing the risk of aggression and domestic violence [99]. Interpersonal conflicts and affective difficulties might strongly increase the risk of suicidal acts, independently of psychiatric disorders [100]. Interestingly, affective difficulties have been associated with poor decision-making, a putative endophenotype of suicide [101]. Moreover, early exposure to maltreatment during childhood has been associated with a 3-fold higher risk of suicide attempts in adulthood [102]. Maltreatment might alter neurobiological pathways, thus decreasing the ability to cope with demands from others and increasing vulnerability to future stressors. This might enhance the risk of emergence of psychiatric disorders, including suicide [103, 104].",
            "Although other recent crises have been associated with a decrease in suicidal rate due to greater social cohesion [105] related to the proximity of life-threatening events [106], it is important to anticipate the potential deleterious psychological effects of COVID-19-related social distancing and social isolation. Several types of interventions have been proposed to reduce social distress, which is associated with suicidal ideation and acts [107] and predicts suicidal behaviors at 1 year [108].",
            "The first strategy is to target the immune response that is induced by social distress [109] and that drives the emergence of depressive symptoms and increases the risk of suicide attempts [62, 110••]. Treatments with drugs that have also anti-inflammatory properties, such as ketamine, show anti-suicidal effect immediately after their intake and for at least 1 week, independently of their anti-depressant effect [111]. Other pharmacological compounds, such as opioid molecules, modulate the activation of neural networks related to social interactions and lower the sensibility to social rejection [112] and social threats [113]. Moreover, low-dose buprenorphine efficiently reduces suicidal ideation [114••].",
            "If future studies show that pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased in psychiatric patients during lockdown, more research will be required to evaluate pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., physical activity) to reduce the consequences of inflammation on health [115]. As soon as quarantine measures were put in place in many countries, the wording “social distancing” appeared. As this might aggravate feelings of loneliness and produce negative long-term health consequences, many authors requested to talk about “physical distancing,” while promoting social connection [116]. Indeed, social connections help people to regulate emotions, cope with stress, and remain resilient during difficult times [117]. In these peculiar times, online interactions can help to foster a sense of connection and potentially boost psychological well-being [118]. Social connections are at the root of collective efficacy and foster hopefulness, as well as opportunities to witness and share positive emotions, compassion for others, altruism, and gratitude. Indeed, all forms of psychological support promote psychological resilience and enhance the psycho-neuroimmunity against COVID-19 [119]. As a matter of fact, self-compassion may protect against stress-induced inflammation and inflammation-related diseases [120]. Expression of gratitude, which is a very straightforward intervention for suicidal patients [121], moderates the relationships between stressful life events and IL-6 [122].",
            "In their timely review on the psychological impact of quarantine, Brooks et al. (2020) highlighted that in order to reduce the mental health effect and to promote adherence, health authorities should emphasize the population’s sense of altruism by stressing that their “staying at home” helps to keep others safe [123••]. Encouraging a shared sense of identity or purpose by acting for the common good may promote cooperative behaviors and increase shared social values (e.g., social cohesion). Social cohesion is a positive neighborhood characteristic defined by feelings of connectedness and solidarity within a community. Among many important person- and neighborhood-level characteristics, social cohesion has been inversely correlated with psychological distress and with lower IL-6 levels [124].",
            "Psychiatrists should educate and promote methods and interventions that foster positive behavioral changes and solidarity. Encouraging people to develop empathy and cooperation while fighting the COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to building compassionate societies and empathic civilizations [125]. Social support could limit the detrimental effects of social isolation on the immune system and may help to boost the psycho-neuroimmunity against this viral infection [119]. Concomitantly, the feeling of social safety and caregiving activates reward neural networks and modulates the expression of pro-inflammatory genes [126]. Social support also helps to prevent feelings of social disconnection and suicide. Algorithms that combine brief contact interventions have been tested [127] as well as connected technologies to prevent suicide in vulnerable patients [128, 129]. A controlled study showed that acceptance and commitment therapy reduces suicidal ideation and psychological pain in high-risk patients with depression [107] and seems to have anti-inflammatory effects [130]. Engagement in art provides some forms of social support to isolated people and may increase the sense of belonging as well as protect from suicidal ideation [131]. In parallel to social connection, art also reduces cytokine levels in serum, such as IL-6 [132]. Encouraging people to share emotional experiences and to get social support should be one of the priority actions of the medical community [133]. Local organization should also help people to connect together, while adhering to physical distancing, in order to develop the sense of belongingness and of purpose [134].",
            "Antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine) reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines by attenuating the behavioral and neuroendocrine effects of immune activation [135]. Additional research is required to study the usefulness of antidepressants as part of the anti-inflammatory strategies against COVID-19 by reducing depression and somatic symptoms.",
            "Actually, there is no specific treatment for suicidal behavior, although antidepressants, lithium, and clozapine are commonly used [136, 137]. It would be important to assess whether these psychotropic drugs interact and worsen infection by SARS-CoV-2 and whether the virus influences their metabolism. Patients taking these drugs often have comorbidities (e.g., diabetes) that increase the infection severity. Some of these treatments have side effects (e.g., neutropenia, dyspnea) that could worsen viral infection. On the other hand, the SARS-CoV-2-related inflammation might affect the metabolism of these drugs by acting on cytochromes [138]. This might increase or decrease the plasmatic levels of psychotropic drugs, thus leading to the appearance of side effects, or to a reduction of the drug efficiency, respectively. Finally, molecules tested in clinical trials on COVID-19 (e.g., hydroxychloroquine) could also interact with psychotropic medications and mutually potentiate their side effects (e.g., cardiac side effects) [139]. Currently, there is no international consensus on the use of psychotropic drugs during this pandemic, except for clozapine [140]. However, even if an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and psychotropic drugs may exist, it is strongly recommended to continue taking the psychotropic medications [138, 139]. Indeed, discontinuation will engender serious deleterious effects for the patients. Indeed, a brutal interruption of lithium, antidepressants, or clozapine can increase the risk of suicidal behavior [141]. Therefore, it is important and necessary to continue treatments in patients at suicide risk and to closely monitor them (e.g., regular dosage of the drug plasma levels, appearance of COVID-19 symptoms) [139, 140].",
            "Interestingly, growing evidence suggests that some psychotropic drugs could have beneficial effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, some studies suggest that haloperidol and chlorpromazine should be tested for COVID-19 [142, 143]. Among treatments used in suicidal behavior, antidepressants could have potential beneficial effects in patients with COVID-19 through their impact on the cytokine “storm.” Antidepressants (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have anti-inflammatory properties by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1, and interferon γ. Several in vitro and in vivo (animal models) studies and trials in humans have shown the anti-inflammatory effect of these drugs at therapeutic concentrations [144–147]. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 could invade the CNS, because other coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) have been detected in the brain of victims and caused brain damage, notably due to inflammation [148, 149]. By passing through the BBB easily, antidepressants could reduce the inflammation induced in the brain by the virus. Moreover, some antidepressants inhibit microglial activation (a primordial vector of inflammation in the brain). For instance, it has been suggested that clomipramine is a potential treatment for multiple sclerosis due to its strong anti-inflammatory effect in the brain [150–152]. Therefore, we could hypothesize that antidepressants may be useful for preventing SARS-CoV-2-linked CNS inflammation and consequently for preventing or reducing the risk of emergence or worsening of suicidal behavior.",
            "Altogether, our narrative review highlights several possible interactions between COVID-19 and vulnerability to suicidal behavior. We propose a biological model (Fig. 1) to explain the higher suicidal vulnerability in individuals confronted with COVID-19 directly (virus infection) or indirectly (exposed to social distancing measures). Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 affects specific biological correlates of suicide: (i) it binds to ACE-2 receptors that are widely expressed in the CNS, are a key component of the renin-angiotensin system, and have been involved in suicidal vulnerability; (ii) SARS-CoV-2 targets nicotinic receptors that are involved in the pathophysiology of mood disorders and suicidal behavior; (iii) SARS-CoV-2 induces the immune response, resulting in chronic low-grade inflammation (peripheral organs and/or brain) that has been associated with suicide; (iv) the nicotinic system regulates ACE/ACE-2 expression and also the inflammatory response and may amplify COVID-19 effect on suicidal vulnerability; and (v) social distancing and feelings of social isolation may increase social pain, a key dimension leading to suicide. Interestingly, drugs used to manage suicidal patients might also prevent inflammation and protect from some of SARS-CoV-2 deleterious effects in the CNS.Fig. 1Proposed model reporting the interaction between SRAS-CoV-2 and biological pathways underlying suicidal vulnerability. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE-2 receptors that are expressed in the central nervous system and are a key component of the renin-angiotensin system involved in suicidal vulnerability. SARS-CoV-2 targets nicotinic receptors that are involved in the pathophysiology of mood disorders and suicidal behavior. SARS-CoV-2 induces the immune response, resulting in chronic low-grade inflammation in peripheral organs and central nervous system, which is associated with suicide. The nicotinic system regulates ACE/ACE-2 expression and also the inflammatory response and may amplify COVID-19 effect on suicidal vulnerability. Social/physical distancing and feelings of social isolation may increase social pain, a key dimension leading to suicide and increasing low-grade inflammation. Psychosocial interventions may protect from suicide, attenuate social isolation, and modulate inflammatory processes. Black arrow: increase; green trait: decrease; dotted line: probable interaction",

            "As suggested by Kim and Su (2020), it is time for immuno-psychiatry services to address the biopsychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on another possible epidemic in the making: suicide [119]. Moreover, the COVID-19 outbreak and the complex biological processes underlying this infection offer new perspectives to better understand the multiple pathways leading to suicidal acts. The hypotheses described above need to be extensively tested. Longitudinal studies will help to determine the impact of chronic inflammation induced by COVID-19 on the frequency of suicidal acts in the mid- (months) and long-term (years). COVID-19 is an opportunity for investigating the naturalistic association between psychiatric symptoms and viral respiratory infections. The naturalist observation of individuals with COVID-19, use of antidepressants, and hospital admissions/visits due to suicide attempts offer a unique opportunity to go from ecological to cohort studies, which are methodologically more powerful [153].",
            "Furthermore, genetic studies should assess the existence of common genetic variants underlying the host’s viral susceptibility and suicide vulnerability to better characterize the possible interactions between pathogen and suicidal behaviors. Ecosystem features influence SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas suicidal behaviors are driven by the psychosocial environment. Hence, possible shared environmental risk factors may underlie infection and suicide risk within a population. It is important to take them into account in future research to disentangle specific viral/neural interactions from other confounding factors. Finally, psychosocial interventions might help to modulate the host’s immune response. Their efficacy for preventing morbidity related to the infection should be assessed. Interestingly, research on treatments for COVID-19 may benefit from studies on suicide because they might broaden the choice of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective drugs. More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of potential psycho-neuroimmunity preventive strategies to enhance resilience and prevent suicidal behavior [154]. Last, social and behavioral sciences and mental health sciences could help to align human behavior with the recommendations by epidemiologists and public health experts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, while preventing the deleterious effects of such measures that may lead to a suicide epidemic. Would this help to build a “compassionate society and empathic civilization” [155] that might be more effective in preventing both epidemics? Probably, but much work remains to be done.",

            "Not in the history of transmissible illnesses has there been an infection as strongly associated with acute cerebrovascular disease as the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. While the risk of stroke has known associations with other viral infections, such as influenza and human immunodeficiency virus, the risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke related to SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented. Furthermore, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has so profoundly impacted psychosocial behaviors and modern medical care that we have witnessed shifts in epidemiology and have adapted our treatment practices to reduce transmission, address delayed diagnoses, and mitigate gaps in healthcare. In this narrative review, we summarize the history and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cerebrovascular disease, and lessons learned regarding the management of patients as we endure this period of human history.",
            "Following the emergence of the novel human coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there has been an explosion of research into the global epidemiologic impact and paradigm shifts in care related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As we move into the third year of the pandemic, with rapidly accumulating literature on the topic, we provide an update to prior reviews [1,2] on the association between COVID-19 and cerebrovascular disease.",
            "Currently having infected more than 750 million persons and accounting for more than 6.9 million fatalities worldwide [3,4], the novel human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was first reported in December 2019, with its first cases in Wuhan, China. Initial manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection include respiratory failure and multiorgan dysfunction, with a wide variety of neurological presentations. Neurological manifestations related to COVID-19 range from common symptoms of gustatory and olfactory dysfunction, headache, and dizziness, to more severe neurological complications of cerebral venous thrombosis, seizures, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and stroke, with a stroke occurring in 1.1–1.5% of patients admitted with COVID-19 according to global reports [5,6].",
            "Over time, new variants of SARS-CoV-2 were identified. Among them, the delta and omicron variants were sequenced in May and November 2021, respectively, and have been implicated in more severe clinical phenotypes of COVID-19. Following the emergence of the delta SARS-CoV-2 variant, there was an increased risk of neurological complications, including stroke and seizure, as well as an increase in anxiety disorders and a heightened risk of early mortality [7,8]. During times when the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 was more prevalent, there were similarly high rates of neurological complications, while the hospitalization rates and duration of symptoms decreased when compared to the delta variant [9]. Compared with patients infected with the delta variant, those affected by omicron had a lower prevalence of the prototypical COVID-19 symptoms of fever, loss of smell, and persistent cough. However, omicron-infected individuals had a higher prevalence of sore throat, hoarse voice, and joint and muscle pain.",
            "In addition to the significant concerns regarding the variable mortality and long-term complications of COVID-19, including the post-acute sequelae syndrome (“Long COVID”) [8], there were considerable concerns regarding higher levels of transmissibility (particularly with delta and omicron variants) and resistance of SARS-CoV-2 variants to vaccines under development [10,11]. In indirect comparisons of clinical trial data, vaccine efficacy for the omicron variant was found to be lower than for the delta variant in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines. Even with subsequent immunizations/boosters, vaccine effectiveness for the delta variant was in the range of 72–95% in comparison to 46–68% for the omicron variant [11].",
            "Given the high risk of thrombotic complications with acute SARS-CoV-2, including ischemic stroke and cerebral vein thrombosis, one might expect a rise in the worldwide incidence rate of ischemic stroke and cerebrovascular disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, for reasons that are summarized in the following sections, there was a global decline in stroke diagnoses during the early months of the pandemic, with other epidemiologic and paradigm changes as a consequence of the biological and psychosocial effects of COVID-19.",
            "Never before has a virus been so strongly linked to a heightened risk of acute cerebrovascular disease. The risk of stroke has a known association with many transmissible infections, including those responsible for bronchitis, influenza, H. pylori, cytomegalovirus, and many others [12]. The inflammatory response to these infections is thought to trigger inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, culminating in vascular events such as ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction [13]. Among the more common infections, the ongoing human immunodeficiency virus pandemic has been associated with a 60% relative increase in the risk of stroke and grows over time, although the overall incidence of stroke with this virus is low (1.28% over a 5-year period) [14]. Influenza, by contrast, is associated with a small but significant early risk (maximal within the first 15 days of symptoms), which disappears within 2 months [15]. The temporal association between stroke and SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the relationship between influenza and stroke in that there is a high early risk that likely decreases with time. However, the risk of stroke is several-fold greater with SARS-CoV-2 than with influenza [16].",
            "Multiple mechanisms account for the unique association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke (Figure 1). Some of these include increased thromboxane synthesis with associated platelet activation, rapid turnover of fibrinogen, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation, as well as thrombus formation following cardiac dysfunction. Following infection, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein activates platelets via platelet angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, resulting in heightened expression of platelet integrin αIIbβ3 and P-selectin, which facilitates degranulation and platelet aggregation [17]. The vascular endothelium is also highly susceptible to viremia given its surface expression of ACE2 receptors, which permits viral entry into endothelial cells, leading to activation/disruption [18]. In parallel with these pathways responsible for platelet activation and endothelial dysfunction, SARS-CoV-2 indirectly activates factor X via inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-6 and IL-8), which increase tissue factor expression, thereby activating the extrinsic pathway [19]. Furthermore, 30–40% of patients with severe COVID-19 may develop myocardial ischemia, elevated troponins, and new heart failure with resultant ventricular dysfunction [20], potentially contributing to intracardiac thrombus formation and stroke or systemic embolism. There is also a suggestion of elevated anticardiolipin IgA, and beta-2-glycoprotein IgG and IgM levels in patients with COVID-19 in several reports [21,22,23], but these serum findings are also found in patients with other acute infections (unrelated to SARS-CoV-2).",
            "Among the multiple thrombotic complications of COVID-19, ischemic stroke has been reported in approximately 1.0–1.5% of all hospitalized individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 [6], with twice as many patients having no identifiable mechanism of cerebral infarction (>40%) as conventional stroke cohorts [24]. Furthermore, in one early multinational cohort of 156 patients with stroke and COVID-19, nearly half (49.5%) presented with a proximal or medium vessel occlusion on initial neuroimaging, a nearly doubled risk compared with historic stroke cohorts with traditional mechanisms [25]. Even more concerning, when considering the “cryptogenic” mechanism of stroke as being directly related to SARS-CoV-2, the risk of early mortality may be five-fold greater than that of patients with other suspected mechanisms of infarction, according to one case–control study (adjusted OR 5.16, 95% CI 1.41–18.87) [26].",
            "In addition to these cerebrovascular complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, although it has not been explicitly studied, the psychosocial consequences of COVID-19 may also impact the risk of cerebrovascular disease. The early avoidance of healthcare institutions in the setting of milder cerebrovascular events [27], delays (or cancellations) in primary care appointments [28], and other factors may have inadvertently affected the control of vascular risk factors and heightened long-term stroke risk. Moreover, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 include an increased risk of diabetes, congestive heart failure, coronary disease, and hypertension [29], which can directly increase the risk of ischemic stroke. Other long-term consequences of COVID-19 such as fatigue, brain fog, and depression [30], which can indirectly augment stroke risk by influencing activity, diet, and lifestyle preferences. The direct and indirect factors associated with stroke and disability following COVID-19 are illustrated in Figure 1.",
            "Beyond its effect on the cardiopulmonary system and the vascular endothelium, SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism and cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) [31,32]. These thromboembolic events are not only disabling in and of themselves [33] but they are also thought of as biomarkers of more severe COVID-19 illness with greater morbidity and mortality. The results from one meta-analysis early in the course of the pandemic, including >8000 patients with COVID-19 (21% of whom developed venous thromboembolism), indicated a 74% higher odds of mortality when venous thromboembolism occurred concomitantly with COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR) 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–2.98) [34].",
            "For a condition with a low historic incidence rate of 1–2 per 100,000 [35], CVT is over 10 times more common in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 than in patients free of this infection [36,37]. In contrast to classic CVT, which is more common in younger female patients and is generally associated with a favorable prognosis, CVT in patients with COVID-19 infection has been more common in older males without traditional risk factors and with greater morbidity and mortality than CVT associated with other conditions [38,39,40]. Along with other data regarding the thrombotic risk of SARS-CoV-2, the risk of CVT gave rise to early recommendations for empiric anticoagulation among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, although evidence justifying these early recommendations was limited (see Section 4).",
            "The elevated incidence of CVT in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, coupled with their hypercoagulable state, provides compelling evidence of a causal link between COVID-19 infection and CVT. However, despite the fact that many studies have shown an increased incidence of CVT in patients with COVID-19 infections, the true incidence and prevalence of CVT among patients with COVID-19 remain unknown. Furthermore, these epidemiological and comparative studies before and during the COVID-19 pandemic should be interpreted with caution as these incidences have not been estimated from the same population (e.g., CVT incidence was largely calculated among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and not the total COVID-19-positive population), and CVT risk factors may be confounded by known COVID-19 morbidity risk factors. For instance, one large multinational longitudinal cross-sectional study (n = 217,560 COVID-19 patients, n = 2313 CVT patients) showed no significant differences in CVT volume or CVT in-hospital mortality overall between the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and the pre-pandemic year [41]. Investigators from this study showed, however, that patients with CVT and COVID-19 had higher in-hospital mortality than COVID-19-negative patients (15.0% vs. 4.5%, p < 0.01).",
            "CVT has also been reported following certain SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, mostly with the adenovirus vector-based vaccines (Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson, Titusville, FL, USA) and ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK)) [36,42]. The similarities between the clinical syndrome reported in these patients and spontaneous heparin-induced thrombocytopenia led investigators to identify circulating platelet-activating platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies in many of these patients [43]. The condition has been named vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia and has preferentially affected young and middle-aged women without pre-existing conditions [44]. These reports have prompted several countries to restrict the use of these vaccines, especially in younger patients. Although the relative morbidity of VITT is concerning, it remains a rare event, and the incidence of CVT among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is significantly higher than the VITT-related CVT [38]. Using publicly available data from Our World In Data, we have previously estimated that, across various age groups, ChAdOx1 and Ad.26.COV2.S may be associated with >95% relative risk reduction for COVID-19-associated CVT as compared to the VITT-related COVID-19 [36]. For this reason, and for many other systemic and public health reasons, the advantages of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination far exceed this risk of vaccination. Moreover, VITT and venous thromboembolic events have not been demonstrated in mRNA-based vaccines [45]. That said, the choice of one vaccine over another ought to be made at the patient level and considering the individualized risk of thrombotic events.",
            "Given the high risk of thrombotic events associated with COVID-19, the safety and efficacy of anticoagulation have been explored in a number of randomized clinical trials [46]. More specifically, it has been established that the prothrombotic state of COVID-19 may be mitigated with heparin, which has anti-factor Xa activity, anti-inflammatory effects, and potential antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 [47]. Importantly, the benefit of antithrombotic treatment in COVID-19 has not been explored in randomized clinical trials for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. Furthermore, trials evaluating antithrombotic therapy have varying inclusion criteria, with some restricting eligibility to those with critical illness (e.g., those requiring invasive ventilation or with multiorgan dysfunction), or those with non-critical illness (see Figure 2 for details).",
            "The RAPID clinical trial investigators evaluated the benefit of therapeutic heparin in critically ill patients with elevated D-dimers for the composite outcome of in-hospital mortality, invasive or non-invasive ventilation, or admission to an intensive care unit. The investigators found no significant advantage of anticoagulation over the standard of care; however, mortality was significantly lower with anticoagulation (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.07–0.65) [48]. The HEP-COVID investigators also reported a benefit of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimers for the outcome of venous or arterial embolism, and death due to any cause (relative risk 0.68; 95% CI 0.49–0.96). In this trial, the benefit was observed exclusively in non-critically ill patients [49]. Unfortunately, the risk of stroke was not reported in either RAPID or HEP-COVID. In the largest randomized clinical trial of non-critically ill patients with COVID-19, the ATTACC, ACTIV-4a, and REMAP-CAP investigators found that therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin increased the probability of patients surviving hospitalization and being discharged with a reduced duration of need for intensive care (median adjusted OR of organ support-free days 1.27, 95% credible interval 1.03–1.58) [50]. Notably, this trial included all comers with COVID-19, and the event rates for primary intracerebral hemorrhage were zero in both arms, and only three ischemic strokes occurred during hospitalization (two with standard-of-care thromboprophylaxis and one with anticoagulation) [50]. The FREEDOM COVID Trialists also reported a survival advantage with therapeutic anticoagulation, although there was no benefit for the primary trial composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, requirement for an intensive care unit level of care, systemic thromboembolism or ischemic stroke [51].",
            "In a meta-analysis of available trial data, there was a significant benefit of therapeutic anticoagulation for the reduction in major thrombotic events (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24–0.90) but only in non-critically ill patients [52]. While there appears to be some benefit of short-term therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin and a potential reduction in the risk of thromboembolism in certain patients with elevated D-dimers in non-critically ill patients, we cannot know whether therapeutic anticoagulation reduces the probability of ischemic stroke or increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in these patients. There are currently no ongoing trials investigating the benefit of treating patients with therapeutic anticoagulation post-discharge for patients with an ischemic stroke. In the absence of high-quality data (and with no planned trials in a stroke population with COVID-19), many stroke providers believe it to be reasonable to consider (at least short-term) therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with ischemic stroke and COVID-19, especially if they are found in multiple vascular territories with an elevated D-dimer, suggesting an embolic phenomenon (Figure 2) [53,54]. In these situations, there is no specific D-dimer threshold high enough to warrant anticoagulation (or at which anticoagulation may be of benefit), although studies have identified heightened thrombotic events with D-dimer thresholds ranging from 1 μg/mL [55] to 500 μg/mL [56].",
            "Although there is likely a benefit of anticoagulation in the primary prevention of major thrombotic events in select patients with COVID-19, benefits for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. Furthermore, guidelines are limited for these scenarios. The 2021 American Heart Association guidelines on secondary stroke prevention (published 15 months after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic) do not mention COVID-19 [57]. Presumably, the risk of subsequent arterial or venous thrombosis following ischemic infarction in a patient with COVID-19 (particularly a non-critically patient with an elevated D-dimer) is high [58,59]. The National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel most recently updated their recommendations in December 2022 for the treatment of COVID-19 and thromboembolic disease, but there is no specific mention of secondary stroke prevention in these guidelines [60]. (Many of these recommendations pertain to the treatment of venous thromboembolism.) In patients with arterial ischemic stroke and an indication for therapeutic anticoagulation (e.g., atrial fibrillation), it is reasonable to treat with therapeutic anticoagulation as long as the risk of bleeding is outweighed by the benefit of anticoagulation. For most patients with stroke and COVID-19, but no alternative indication for anticoagulation, single antiplatelet (or short-term dual antiplatelet) therapy is safe and may be effective. For patients with embolic cryptogenic infarcts presumably due to COVID-19 hypercoagulability, particularly those with elevated D-dimers who are non-critically ill, short-term anticoagulation (30–60 days) with heparin and bridge to a direct oral anticoagulant can be considered, followed by antiplatelet monotherapy. For stroke patients with incidentally found SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction, and no concern for hypercoagulable state, antiplatelet monotherapy (or short-term dual antiplatelet treatment, per guidelines [57]) is reasonable for secondary stroke prevention.",
            "Any potential benefit of antithrombotic therapy must be weighed against the risk of hemorrhage. Among patients with COVID-19, there is a heightened risk of intracranial hemorrhage [61]. An international study showed that patients with COVID-19 and acute ischemic stroke had higher rates of bleeding complications with revascularization treatment (intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy) and worse outcomes than contemporaneous patients who were being treated without COVID-19 [62]. Nonetheless, in the absence of a control group of patients who did not receive revascularization treatment, there are insufficient data regarding the risks of intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke [63]. Therefore, COVID-19 (or suspected COVID-19) should not be a contraindication to systemic thrombolysis. Furthermore, endovascular recanalization is not thought to be futile in patients with proximal large vessel occlusion who would otherwise meet the criteria for thrombectomy [2]. While proximal intracranial occlusions are independent risk factors for poor outcomes and early mortality in the setting of COVID-19 [26,64], these patients should not be excluded from endovascular treatment [65]. One multicenter retrospective analysis of 575 patients with proximal intracranial occlusion (n = 194 with COVID-19) reported lower rates of successful recanalization (modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade 3) in patients with COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 patients (39.2% vs. 67.2%; adjusted OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2–0.8, p < 0.01) with higher rates of discharge with mRS > 2 (79.8% vs. 66.7%; adjusted OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1–5.8, p = 0.03) with propensity score matching [66]. However, these patients still achieved better clinical outcomes than historic cohorts of non-COVID-19 patients with proximal occlusions treated medically.",
            "The duration of antithrombotic treatment in patients with stroke presumably due to COVID-19 is unclear. While the severity of COVID-19 is mediated, in part, by many vascular risk factors (such as diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), which predispose to cerebrovascular events, COVID-19 has been implicated as a unique mechanism of cerebral infarction irrespective of this clinical history. For these patients who survive COVID-19 and have no other cause of stroke, it is unclear what—if any—benefit may be gained from lifelong antithrombotic treatment. Such ill-defined benefit from long-term antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy following COVID-19-associated stroke is much like the unclear advantage of long-term antithrombotic therapy in cervical artery dissection. The 2021 Guidelines from the American Heart Association have recommended anticoagulation for patients in a hypercoagulable state [57]. However, this is dependent on the cause of the patient’s hypercoagulable state, and it is still unclear whether oral anticoagulation with direct oral anticoagulants or vitamin K antagonists offers differential protection from thrombotic events when compared to heparin.",
            "The reader is referred to the National Institutes of Health [60] for the latest updates on antithrombotic recommendations in COVID-19 and to be cognizant of any future societal recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19-associated cerebrovascular disease. As with any off-label treatment, deviations from such recommendations or guidelines ought to be carefully considered and justified given the rapidly changing evidence for treatment.",
            "For many reasons, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a decline in new diagnoses of acute cerebrovascular disease [5,6,27,67,68], myocardial infarction [69,70], and other acute medical conditions [71]. Some of this epidemiologic shift was driven by the abrupt change in medical-seeking behaviors of patients (who became avoidant of healthcare institutions due to fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2) [72,73,74]. However, there is also compelling evidence that declines in other transmissible infections, such as influenza [75], mediate declines in vascular events [2,12]. Despite the greater risk of ischemic stroke due to SARS-CoV-2 than infections like influenza [16], the significantly lower incidence rate of other communicable respiratory and gastrointestinal infections during the COVID-19 pandemic [75,76] (which may be more common than SARS-CoV-2) likely displaced any rise in the stroke rate due to SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Early in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, as healthcare systems adapted to contact and respiratory precautions, several major barriers to acute stroke care emerged [1]. First, there was a dramatic change in available emergency medical services with fewer available first responders in the community. Second, while the overall number of patients treated in emergency departments fell steeply [77], safety precautions implemented in emergency departments led to bottlenecks in acute care for many conditions, including stroke. While data do not indicate consistent delays in neurodiagnostic testing (e.g., due to the need for frequent decontamination of equipment), resource limitations and precautions have been associated with delays in intravenous thrombolysis, according to several large analyses [78,79] and mechanical thrombectomy [80], with expected deleterious effects on clinical outcomes [81].",
            "As stated previously, SARS-CoV-2 has been directly related to large vessel intracranial occlusions [26,82], which are amenable to endovascular treatment. Access to endovascular treatment centers and time to recanalization therapy do not seem to have been adversely affected by the COVID-pandemic [83,84], despite the precautions necessary to maintain the safety of patients and providers. Pandemic preparedness campaigns and early guidance from multiple vascular societies may have influenced the stability of treatment times and specialist availability [63,85,86]. In addition, many non-urgent endovascular cases were rescheduled to reduce unnecessary patient exposure in healthcare settings [2,87], with concomitant increases in endovascular treatment (over open surgical treatment) of other acute conditions such as ruptured intracranial aneurysms [67].",
            "In addition to these collateral effects on acute intervention and stabilization of patients with stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic, we also witnessed changes in patient and family education, disposition planning, and post-discharge follow-up. With the implementation of contact precautions, many family members were prohibited from entering healthcare facilities. Therefore, an extensive amount of stroke education was provided to patients in person, or to caregivers via telephone, when possible. While it has not been well studied, the limited bandwidth of providers during this time and these changes in education and counseling may have negatively impacted patient and caregiver teaching. Further compounding the (potentially suboptimal) education difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic was the reduction in patient time spent with rehabilitation specialists. A large number of stroke [88,89] and non-stroke [90,91] patients admitted during the pandemic who were potentially eligible for discharge to acute inpatient rehabilitation facilities were discharged more frequently to home (with fewer available therapy services). This disposition derailment may be due to a number of collateral effects of the pandemic. First, discharges to home may be preferred by patients, caregivers, and providers because they can be planned more quickly than arranging a discharge to an inpatient facility. Second, discharges to home (which may be faster) can reduce the exposure of patients to hospital and rehabilitation facility staff, as well as other patients, potentially carrying SARS-CoV-2. And finally, during the pandemic, discharges to post-acute care institutions were delayed due to a decline in the availability of rehabilitation and nursing facilities [92]. At follow-up, in-person contact with healthcare providers and hospital staff was quickly restricted. While telemedicine appointments became a new standard of care and reduced the exposure of patients and caregivers to SARS-CoV-2, these virtual services increased the accessibility of patients to specialty providers across great distances. Furthermore, telemedicine reduced the consumption of personal protective equipment [93]. That said, the (practically obligatory) transition from in-person to telemedical visits was fraught with early difficulties regarding reimbursement for services and limitations of physical assessments, many of which have been assuaged over time.",
            "To say that the COVID-19 pandemic has altered the epidemiology of stroke and transformed the manner in which we care for our patients would be an understatement. As we endure through this pandemic, we would be remiss in ignoring the lessons learned along the way. Our deeper understanding of the relationship between transmissible infections and ischemic stroke should reinforce the value of primary care, attention to basic hygienic interventions, and vaccinations. The success of telemedicine in providing subspecialty care to rural areas and patients with limited mobility or access to providers has the potential to reduce many disparities. And while there is much we have learned for the better, we have also grown more cautious to accept published information as fact. Early reports seeking to dispel myths of stroke due to COVID-19 [94], or misleading statements pertaining to the risks of COVID-19 vaccination [95], have caused us to question social media, journalism, and even scientific, peer-reviewed publications. Furthermore, such misinformation campaigns have sowed a public sense of mistrust of medical providers so deep that it may take a generation (or more) to rectify. With that in mind, let us accept and embrace this journey to rehabilitate the public perspective of healthcare providers and clinical science. As patient advocates, we have a renewed obligation to leverage all resources available to us—ranging from scientific methods to social media—to promote the dissemination of accurate information and improve the well-being of our patients and communities.",

            "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a life-threatening disease, especially in elderly individuals and those with comorbidities. The predominant clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is respiratory dysfunction, while neurological presentations are increasingly being recognized. SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells primarily via attachment of the spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on cell membranes. Patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and prone to severe clinical outcomes. Recent studies have revealed some common risk factors for AD and COVID-19. An understanding of the association between COVID-19 and AD and the potential related mechanisms may lead to the development of novel approaches to treating both diseases. In the present review, we first summarize the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 invades the central nervous system (CNS) and then discuss the associations and potential shared key factors between COVID-19 and AD, with a focus on the ACE2 receptor, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, age, and neuroinflammation.",
            "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already resulted in more than 540 million infections and over 6 million deaths worldwide as of 27 June 2022 (https://covid19.who.int). The aged individuals and those with comorbidities are at a particularly high risk of poor outcomes [1]. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with four major structural proteins: envelope, membrane, spike (S) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein [2]. SARS-CoV-2 infects target cells primarily via interaction of the receptor-binding domain of the S protein with the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor after activation of the S protein by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) [3]. Thus, the expression and distribution of ACE2 is critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The S protein is composed of two functional subunits, S1 and S2; S1 is responsible for receptor binding, whereas S2 (the C-terminal domain) is specifically responsible for viral-cellular membrane fusion [4]. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory tract, causing fever, dry cough, sore throat, fatigue, and dyspnoea [5], the virus also results in dysfunction of multiple organ systems outside the lung, including the kidneys, liver, brain, heart, gastrointestinal tract and other organs [6–9], as ACE2 and other candidate receptors are also expressed in these tissues [10].",
            "Emerging studies have revealed the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 [11, 12], with neurological manifestations ranging from lethargy, headache, loss of smell and taste, delirium, insomnia, brain inflammation, stroke, brain haemorrhage to cognitive impairment [13–15]. In fact, the central nervous system (CNS) complications have been observed in more than 30% of individuals with COVID-19 presenting with a higher infection severity [14]. Therefore, studies designed to provide insights into the invasion and effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS are critical. Various studies using cultured cells, animal models, and brain tissues from patients who died of COVID-19, have independently revealed the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to invade the CNS [16, 17]. Supporting evidence from a postmortem study indicated the presence of viral RNA and proteins in the brains of more than half (21 of 40) of German patients who died of COVID-19 [17], and this phenomenon was confirmed by other neuropathological case studies [18, 19]. In addition, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of infected individuals also confirms CNS infection [15, 20, 21]. Notably, by employing well-characterized human brain organoids, researchers have visualized widespread infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and extensive death of virus-infected and nearby neuronal cells, and found that the viral infection can be abrogated by pretreatment with an ACE2 antibody or administration of CSF obtained from patients with COVID-19 [12]. Moreover, brain imaging studies have revealed the presence of multiple haemorrhagic lesions and changes in the brain structure of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, even in milder cases [22–24]. Together, this evidence implies that SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to enter the CNS and cause neurological conditions.",
            "Researchers have speculated that the CNS invasion may occur along nerves or through haematogenous spread [25]. CNS infection may lead to neuroinflammation, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and alterations in neurovascular and cognition functions, which are closely related to the risk and progression of neurodegenerative diseases [26]. Elderly individuals and those with comorbid conditions are more vulnerable to infection and may be subject to severe outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individuals with dementia are three-fold more likely to contract severe COVID-19 condition (requiring hospitalization) than those without dementia [27, 28], and the mortality rate is 30% higher in patients who suffer dementia [29]. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) accounts for more than 60% of all dementia cases [30]. AD pathology is complex and determined by age, heredity, and environmental factors [31]. The main pathological manifestations of AD are the formation of extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles comprising abnormal tau, as well as neuroinflammation in the brain [32]. The morbidity and mortality rates for COVID-19 are increased in subjects with AD, which is possibly due to the AD-related pathological changes and factors, such as elevated proinflammatory molecules, an advanced age, BBB disruption, presence of APOE epsilon4 (APOE ε4) allele, diabetes mellitus, and lifestyle factors [33, 34]. Therefore, studies on the associations between AD and SARS-CoV-2 and the potential mechanisms are urgently needed. Here, we summarize the potential routes by which SARS-CoV-2 invades the CNS and then provide an overview of the associations and potential shared pathogenic mechanisms between SARS-CoV-2 and AD, with a focus on the ACE2 receptor, APOE genotype, age, and neuroinflammation, in order to advance the understanding of associations between COVID-19 and AD.",
            "The presence of viral RNA, proteins or particles in postmortem brain tissues and in the CSF of infected patients indicates the infiltration of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS. Studies on the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 invades the CNS, which are important for disease diagnosis, prognosis and interventional strategies, are ongoing. Researchers have proposed that SARS-CoV-2 enters the CNS mainly via the direct neuronal route or through haematogenous transport [35, 36].",
            "The neuronal route relies on retrograde axonal transport of the virus from infected peripheral nerves. Evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 potentially infects the CNS by travelling along olfactory axon bundles. The upper and rear part of the nasal cavity is the olfactory mucosa. The respiratory tract makes direct contact with the CNS through the olfactory sensory neurons. The cilia of the olfactory sensory neurons are present in the nasal cavity, and their axons extend into the olfactory bulb by passing through the ethmoid plate. Intact SARS-CoV-2 particles and viral RNA have been detected in the olfactory mucosa and in neuroanatomical regions that receive olfactory tract projections, indicating that the neuroinvasion occurs via the olfactory pathway [37]. SARS-CoV-2 has been observed to invade the CNS through this route in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mice [38] and hamsters [39] (which express the human ACE2 receptor driven by the promoter of the human cytokeratin 18 gene), resulting in a life-threatening disease similar to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection [16, 40]. In those studies, viral RNA was detected in the brains of all animals five days after intranasal administration of SARS-CoV-2, and the severity of neuropathological deficits correlated well with the virus level in the brain. Consistently, in rhesus monkeys exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through intranasal inoculation, the viral RNA copies were sequentially detected in nasal mucosa, olfactory trigone, and entorhinal area, and the viral protein was detected in some functional brain areas, including the thalamus, entorhinal area, medulla oblongata, hippocampus and prepyriform cortex [41]. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be transported to the CNS via the olfactory route. In fact, human coronavirus OC43, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-1 have all been shown to infect the murine CNS via the reverse axonal transport route, invading olfactory sensory neurons in the nasal cavity and then being transported to other neural cells [42–45]. Given the similarities of the viral nucleic acid sequences of coronaviruses [46], SARS-CoV-2 may utilize a similar neural invasion mechanism. The persistence of anosmia and ageusia, typical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the olfactory system, in a portion of patients even after recovery from infection, also supports this route of transport. Interestingly, olfactory dysfunction and structural alterations in the olfactory-related regions are early manifestations of several neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and Parkinson's disease [47–49]. Some researchers have considered that the olfactory nerve is not likely the primary route through which SARS-CoV-2 accesses the brain [50], as human olfactory sensory neurons do not express or exhibit low expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2, two key genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry [51]. Instead, proteins of the two genes are abundant in samples of the whole olfactory mucosa of humans [51] and in mouse olfactory epithelium [52]. Infection of the olfactory epithelium allows the virus to spread to horizontal basal cells as well as immature and mature olfactory neurons. In addition, the infected horizontal basal cells mature into olfactory sensory neurons [53], allowing the virus to reach the olfactory bulb through synaptic connections, thus providing the possibility of CNS infection (Fig. 1). Notably, in addition to ACE2, other receptors such as neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), a signalling protein, have also been discovered to serve as important SARS-CoV-2 receptors and enhance the viral infectivity [54, 55]. NRP-1 is expressed at high levels in the olfactory epithelium, olfactory tubules and paraolfactory gyri, further supporting its role in virus entry into olfactory epithelial cells [54, 56]. These studies indicate that the sustentacular cells are vulnerable to coronavirus entry and give rise to anosmia. Therefore, the olfactory pathway may constitute an important route of CNS invasion. In addition to the olfactory nerve, other peripheral nerves, including the vagus, trigeminus, and nasopharyngeal nerves, may be potential routes through which SARS-CoV-2 accesses the brain [57].Fig. 1SARS-CoV-2 invades the CNS through the olfactory nerve. Once SARS-CoV-2 enters the nasal cavity, it contacts with olfactory epithelial cells, which express ACE2 and NRP-1 receptors at high levels, rendering the epithelium vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The infected olfactory epithelial cells potentially transmit the virus to the surrounding cells, such as horizontal basal cells as well as immature and mature olfactory neurons. The infected horizontal basal cells also mature into olfactory sensory neurons. These neuronal cells extend to the apex, contact the air, and form small nerve bundles at the base before passing through the ethmoid plate and forming the olfactory nerve. Infected olfactory neurons are connected to neurons in the olfactory bulb through synapses, which allows the virus to spread from the olfactory nerve to the olfactory bulb via retrograde transport along axons. The olfactory bulb makes many connections throughout the brain, allowing the virus to spread quickly to other structures in the brain",

            "In addition to the olfactory route, SARS-CoV-2 may also enter the CNS via the haematogenous route; however, in this route the virus must be able to cross the BBB to achieve entry into the CNS. The BBB, which is composed of endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes, functions as an important supporting and protective interface that restricts the entry of circulating molecules, such as neurotoxic plasma components, leucocytes, and pathogens, into the brain [58]. SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lungs may lead to endothelial damage and increased capillary permeability [59, 60], which facilitates virus transfer from the lungs to the pulmonary microcirculation (Fig. 2a). SARS-CoV-2 in the blood will enter the cerebral circulation, where the slow blood flow may promote potential interactions of S protein with ACE2 [61] and NRP-1[62] on microvascular endothelial cells [35]. The presence of virus-like particles in the brain capillary endothelium in the frontal lobe of a patient who died from COVID-19 provides direct evidence for viral invasion into brain microvascular endothelial cells of the BBB [63]. Autopsy studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 disrupts the BBB. This has been confirmed in 2D static and 3D microfluidic engineered models of the human BBB [64]. In this model, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein activates the proinflammatory response in the brain endothelium and contributes to increased barrier permeability, which facilitates viral entry into the brain (Fig. 2b). In addition, viral RNA occasionally appears in the vascular wall, perivascular region, and brain microvascular endothelium of SARS-CoV-2-challenged K18-hACE2 transgenic mice [65]. Other mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the BBB integrity include invasion of BBB epithelial cells and astrocytes, disruption of placodes or the actin cytoskeleton, and phosphorylation of tight junction proteins [66, 67]. SARS-CoV-2 also infects leukocytes and enters the BBB via these cells [68, 69]. Systemic virus dissemination in the CNS may also occur via exosomal cellular transport and lymphatic spread following infection, immune activation, and production of granulocyte macrophages [70]. Recently, researchers have observed that challenge with SARS-CoV-2 results in infection of the epithelium of the choroid plexus and leads to the breakdown of the blood-CSF barrier in an organoid model of the human choroid plexus, providing another entry route for SARS-CoV-2 into the brain [71]. Ultimately, the virus in the CSF must infect or penetrate the BBB to enter the brain. Notably, AD in particular has an early pathology associated with increased permeability and disruption of the BBB, which, together with reduced cerebral blood flow, can place individuals at a higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 [72–74]. Moreover, even older individuals who are not yet symptomatic for AD (but who are perhaps very early in the pathological trajectory in developing AD) may experience some BBB degeneration and an early loss of pericytes, which promote increased vulnerability to the virus. After the virus enters brain cells, the viral life cycle begins, including genome replication, protein synthesis, assembly, maturation and virus release, ultimately leading to brain tissue infection and neurological symptoms (Fig. 2c). It has been widely demonstrated that vaccines are the most efficient tools for preventing COVID-19. Studies have reported that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and well-tolerated in patients with neurological disorders [75]. Nevertheless, a recent study reported that vaccinated patients with AD displayed a significantly increased overall risk for breakthrough infections (approximately 10.3%) than the matched older adults without dementia (approximately 5.6%) [76]. However, after further matching for comorbidities, such as heart diseases, cancers, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, dementia patients no longer showed an obvious increase in risk of breakthrough infections. In addition, several rare neurological complications can occur in individuals who received COVID-19 vaccines (ChAdOx1nCoV-19 and BNT162b2), such as Guillain–Barré syndrome, Bell’s palsy and myasthenic disorders [77], whereas such complications are much more common among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the possible use of vaccines in preventing the spread of viral infection throughout the CNS, as well as to evaluate the protective effects of vaccination on AD and the potential side effects.Fig. 2SARS-CoV-2 infects the brain via the haematogenous route. a SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus that spreads primarily through airborne droplets, causing infection of the lungs.

            "In conclusion, there are two major potential routes by which SARS-CoV-2 invades the brain: the olfactory pathway and haematogenous transport. Despite the evidence presented here, the primary invasion route, the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 spreads throughout the brain, and the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced damage to the CNS remain unclear and require further studies. Furthermore, how the coronavirus enters the bloodstream remains an open question.",
            "The transmembrane glycoprotein ACE2 is a vital component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that is responsible for catalysing the conversion of angiotensin (Ang) II into Ang (1–7), thus protecting against the harmful effects of the ACE1/Ang-II axis [78]. Ang-II exerts vasoconstrictive, proinflammatory hypertrophy, and profibrotic effects, while Ang (1–7) exerts opposing effects, such as antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and mild vasodilatory effects, to protect against various cardiovascular diseases [79, 80]. In addition to acting as a negative regulator of RAS, ACE2 also plays a protective role in inflammatory lung diseases in other manners. Studies have identified that des-Arg9 bradykinin (DABK) is a biological substrate of ACE2 in airway epithelial cells, and the attenuation of ACE2 activity facilitates neutrophil infiltration, which is partially attributed to the modulation of DABK/bradykinin receptor B1 axis signalling [81]. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, ACE2 has been recognized as the main host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The amount and distribution of ACE2 may influence the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As the respiratory tract is the dominant target of SARS-CoV-2, high levels of ACE2 have been detected in respiratory epithelial cells and pulmonary type II alveolar cells [82]. However, ACE2 expression is not restricted to the respiratory tract, as kidney proximal tubule cells, bladder urothelial cells, ileum and oesophageal epithelial cells, neurons and glial cells in the brain, and myocardial cells all exhibit high levels of ACE2 [61, 83–87]. As a result, the function and hyperactivity of the ACE2 receptor may increase the sensitivity of these target cells and organs to SARS-CoV-2 infection. ACE2 plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 neuroinfection, but its expression in the context of AD remains controversial. A recent study reported that the ACE2 protein level is upregulated in the hippocampal tissues of patients with AD and that the change is not age- or sex-dependent, indicating a direct relationship between AD and ACE2 expression [88]. Another study detected ACE2 expression in multiple brain regions of a recently deceased patient with AD, and ACE2 expression was significantly increased in the temporal lobe and CA1 region of the hippocampus [89]. In addition, RNA-seq showed that the expression of ACE2 mRNA is elevated in cortical tissues from  5× FAD mice [90] but not significantly altered in the blood. However, previous studies have reported inconsistent findings for ACE2 expression and its effect on AD pathology. Immunohistochemical staining showed that ACE2 expression varies across different brain regions, decreased in the hippocampus, visual cortex, basal nucleus, amygdala, middle frontal gyrus and entorhinal cortex in response to AD pathology [91]. Specifically, ACE2 activity is obviously decreased in the postmortem brain tissues of patients with AD compared to those of age-matched controls, and is inversely related to Aβ levels and tau phosphorylation [92]. The decrease of ACE2 expression in the context of AD indicates the occurrence of RAS dysregulation and neurological damage in corresponding brain regions. Additional studies have also supported this hypothesis. For instance, elevated ACE2 activity in the brain induced by intraperitoneal administration of an established ACE2 activator (diminazene aceturate) reduces Aβ-related pathology and delays cognitive impairment in symptomatic (aged) Tg2576 mice and protects against the onset of cognitive decline in presymptomatic (younger) Tg2576 mice [93]. A previous study also found that a longer, neurotoxic species of Aβ (Aβ43) is converted into a shorter, less toxic or neuroprotective form of Aβ (Aβ40) by ACE and ACE2 [94] and that this conversion is reversed by the specific ACE2 inhibitor DX600. The researchers also found that ACE2 activity is decreased in the sera of patients with AD compared with the sera of age-matched controls, indicating a relationship between lower ACE2 activity and AD. Likewise, in a D-galactose-ovariectomized rat model of ageing and dementia, increased activation of ACE2 via administration of dimenazine ameliorates Aβ pathology in the brain and improves cognitive performance [95]. Therefore, during the initial stages of AD, maintaining ACE2 activity in the brain may be a protective factor, limiting the progression of AD pathology. Thus, researchers have speculated that the SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced downregulation of ACE2 expression in target cells [96] may inhibit the protective effect of ACE2 against AD. However, ACE2 levels in the CSF are similar between patients with AD and controls [97]. Furthermore, no significant difference in ACE2 activity was observed in the cerebral cortex or hippocampus of SAMP8 mice, a non-transgenic animal model of sporadic AD, during disease progression [98]. Possible explanations for the inconsistency in results among these studies might be the differences in animal models used, brain areas selected, and detection methods employed.",
            "In conclusion, high levels of ACE2 enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas ACE2 expression decreases once viral infection occurs, and the protective function of ACE2 is inhibited. At present, the changes in ACE2 expression that occur in the context of AD are controversial. Future studies using more animal models and larger sample sizes, especially specimens from more patients with AD, will help to clarify the expression of ACE2 in individuals with AD and the relationship between ACE2 and AD pathology. Additionally, the role of ACE2 in virus transmission throughout the brain requires further study.",
            "The manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection vary widely among individuals, from no symptoms to life-threatening conditions, suggesting that the host genetic background may influence the risk and severity of virus infection [99, 100]. An important genetic factor is the APOE genotype. ApoE is a multifaceted secreted protein synthesized by astrocytes in the CNS and by the liver in the periphery [101]. Human APOE encodes a 299-amino-acid protein with three major isoforms that differ at amino acid residues 112 and 158, i.e., apoE2 (Cys112, Cys158), apoE3 (Cys112, Arg158), and apoE4 (Arg112, Arg158). The amino acid differences exert profound effects on the apoE protein structure and function [102, 103]. APOE4 is the strongest genetic susceptibility factor for sporadic AD [104], accounting for more than 95% of all AD cases [105]. ApoE2 is protective, and apoE3 is neutral [106]. Previous studies have reported that APOE4 is related to the occurrence and severity of infections with viruses and pathogenic microorganisms, such as HIV-1 [107], herpes simplex [108] and hepatitis C [109]. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of studies have been conducted on the possible associations of APOE polymorphisms with SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity. Recently, Kuo et al. found that APOE ε4/ε4 homozygotes exhibit a more than two-fold higher susceptibility to COVID-19 [110, 111] and a four-fold higher risk of mortality than APOE ε3/ε3 homozygotes, according to data from the UK Biobank cohort [110, 111]. The association was not diminished even after controlling for APOE4-related diseases, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, and dementia, suggesting that APOE4 may exert an independent effect on COVID-19 severity. Other studies have reported similar findings in Spanish and Iraqi subjects: the ε4 allele of the APOE gene increases the incidence and clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection [112, 113]. Another study showed no obvious difference in the frequency of the ε4 allele between viral RNA-positive subjects and the control population in a Czech cohort [114]. When the data were further analysed after stratification according to the disease status, the results revealed a significantly higher frequency of the ε4 allele in symptomatic subjects, indicating that the ε4 allele may be associated with an increased risk of symptomatic COVID-19. Notably, a recent study on a Finnish population indicated that the ε4 carriers are prone to severe COVID-19 and prolonged mental fatigue, partially due to cerebrovascular damage [115]. The effect of APOE4 on the susceptibility to and the severity of COVID-19 may provide an explanation for the variations of severity of COVID-19 among different ethnic groups. The frequency of the ε4 allele is approximately 30%–40% in black Africans and approximately 7%–20% in Caucasians [116]. Studies have indicated that the burden and the mortality rate of COVID-19 are disproportionately higher in black persons/African Americans than in white persons [117, 118], and black individuals with dementia are more prone to contracting SARS-CoV-2 than white individuals with dementia [119]. In contrast, Gunanidhi D et al. [120] conducted a global epidemiological study on the correlation of apoE isoforms with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and observed a significant but negative relationship between the ε4 allele and COVID-19 susceptibility. When the data were further analysed after stratification according to ethnicity, the researchers observed that the ε4 isoform protected against COVID-19 in Asians but not in Europeans, Africans or Americans.",
            "Multiple molecular mechanisms may underlie the possible relationship of APOE polymorphisms with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity, and some of the mechanisms remain speculative. Recently, an in vitro study revealed that the APOE4 genotype increases the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and astrocytes, and that APOE4-expressing astrocytes produce a detrimental response compared with APOE3 carriers [26] (Fig. 3a). These results suggest that APOE4 may exert a causal effect on the severity of COVID-19. Another potential mechanism is that APOE4 is associated with increased BBB permeability [121], which allows the virus to enter the CNS more easily through BBB leakage and makes patients more susceptible to infection [122] (Fig. 3b). Moreover, APOE4 has been reported to promote production of proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6 and TNF-α) by macrophages in the CNS and the periphery in response to proinflammatory stimuli [123–125] (Fig. 3c). As the cytokine storm has been identified as a critical hallmark of severe COVID-19 [126], APOE4 may be responsible for the poor outcomes of patients with COVID-19 due to its effect on the host immune response. Additionally, compared to AD patients with the APOE ε3/ε3 genotype, those with the ε4/ε4 genotype exhibit decreased expression of several antiviral defence genes, such as IFITM2, IFITM3, IFNAR1 and LY6E [127] (Fig. 3d). Compared to the two other isoforms, APOE4 is genetically associated with reduced apoE levels, which increases the risk of coronavirus infection and disease progression, and this reduction is consistently associated with severe COVID-19 [128]. Notably, APOE4 may contribute to the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 by regulating intracellular cholesterol levels. ApoE is an amphipathic protein that is responsible for regulating organismal lipid and cholesterol homeostasis [129]. Individuals carrying the ε4 allele exhibit elevated intracellular and circulating cholesterol levels [130], and a high cellular cholesterol level may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by increasing the binding of the S protein to the ACE2 receptor [131, 132] (Fig. 3e). Moreover, a recent molecular docking study revealed that the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the apoE protein, potentially leading to the exposure of the active site of apoE; thus, the virus may enter host cells via apoE-related metabolic pathways [133]. However, this interaction must be confirmed by experimental studies, and whether this binding effect depends on the apoE isoform remains to be determined. Additionally, the interactions between apoE and the ACE2 receptor should be investigated to determine the direct relationship between APOE and COVID-19. Pathologically, apoE has been shown to be coexpressed with ACE2 in alveolar epithelial cells [134], which are the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2, and treatment with rhACE2 or genetic ablation of ACE2 has been shown to modulate apoE-related physiological functions [135]. However, the correlation between apoE and ACE2 levels should be examined in the context of COVID-19. Additionally, APOE4 is a risk factor for several cardiovascular and neurological diseases, such as AD [102], atherosclerosis [136], and diabetes [137]. Individuals with these pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to developing severe COVID-19 and having higher mortality rates following SARS-CoV-2 infection [138, 139] (Fig. 3f). Thus, although apoE may exert independent effects on the risk of infection and disease severity, these comorbidities should be considered.Fig. 3APOE4 contributes to increased susceptibility to COVID-19. a\nAPOE4 was shown to increase the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes. b\nAPOE4 has been reported to be associated with increased BBB permeability. c ApoE4 is related to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages in the periphery and by microglial cells in the CNS. d Compared to AD patients presenting the APOE ε3/ε3 genotype, AD patients with the ε4/ε4 genotype display decreased expression of several antiviral defence genes, such as IFITM2, IFITM3, IFNAR1 and LY6E.\ne Individuals carrying the ε4 allele exhibit elevated intracellular and circulating cholesterol levels, and a high level of cellular cholesterol may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection. f\nAPOE4 is a risk factor for several cardiovascular and neurological diseases, and individuals with these pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to infection and poor clinical outcomes. Thus, individuals with the APOE4 genotype are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may lead to neurodegeneration",

            "In summary, the inconsistency in the findings related to the association between APOE gene polymorphism and COVID-19 risk and severity may be due to the differences in the genetic characteristics and age of the included subjects, the case definitions and the number of subjects employed. Further research in a larger sample size and employing subjects with different ethnic backgrounds will help identify those who are at high risks of infection and severe disease, in order to help prioritize health care and preventive measures. In addition, the direct effects of apoE isoforms on COVID-19 severity and the related pathways require further investigations in patients, animals, and cells to better delineate the major underlying mechanisms, thus facilitating the development of targeted interventions.",
            "Age is the greatest risk factor for AD [140], as the prevalence and mortality of AD increase substantially with age [141]. Approximately one in 10 people aged ≥ 65 years has AD, and the prevalence increases to 32% in those aged ≥ 85 years, among whom the per-year incidence rate is approximately 6.5% [142]. Age affects the pathology of AD in a number of ways, such as by causing dysregulation of innate immune responses, impairment of the BBB, and alterations in neuroinflammation [140]. Accumulating evidence has shown that elderly individuals, especially those with comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, cancers, and diabetes, are particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and are more likely to develop severe illness [143–145]. Notably, a systematic study assessed the clinical, molecular, and immunological characteristics of 326 patients with COVID-19 from China and found that age, among other factors, is the most obviously associated with disease severity [146]. Early evidence from China indicated that the case-fatality ratio (CFR) of COVID-19 is less than 0.4% among patients aged 40 years and younger, 8% among patients aged 70–79 years and a startling 14.8% among those aged 80 years and older [147]. A consistent and more pronounced age-related trend in the CFR of COVID-19 has been reported in the Italian population: patients aged 40 years or younger have a CFR of less than 0.4%, whereas the CFR is markedly increased to 12.8% in patients aged 70–79 years and further increased to 20.2% in those aged ≥ 80 years [148]. In addition, the overall CFR in the Italian population (7.2%) was reported to be substantially higher than that observed in China (2.3%), possibly in part because that Italy has one of the highest percentages of elderly individuals worldwide, with an average life expectancy of 82.3 years and a proportion of 23% for individuals aged 65 years or older. Similar exponential increases in the CFR of COVID-19 with age have been reported in other countries. A meta-analysis of more than 600,000 patients with COVID-19 from the United Kingdom, China, Spain, Italy, and New York State reported that the mortality rate in patients aged 60–69 years was more than three times higher than that in those aged 50 to 59 years [149].",
            "Several potential factors may account for the marked increase in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and poor clinical outcomes in the elderly. First, age-related impairment and dysregulation of the host innate and adaptive immune systems may lead to decreased protection against virus infection and result in a state of chronic inflammation [150–152]. In addition, the levels of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), Toll-like receptor (TLR), TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, generally increase with age [153, 154]. These changes result in the low-grade proinflammatory state observed in older populations [155], which may contribute to severe disease conditions. Specifically, increased serum CRP levels, which indicate an inflammatory state and are associated with advanced age, indicate a poor prognosis and increased risk of mortality in elderly patients with COVID-19 [156, 157]. Additionally, serum CRP levels have been used to monitor COVID-19 progression and patients’ response to COVID-19 treatments, such as tocilizumab [158]. Notably, loss of cerebrovascular integrity, a feature of ageing, may enable pathogens to enter the brains of older individuals [159]. Moreover, increases in the expression of ACE2, the major receptor for SARS-CoV-2, with age in several human tissues, such as the nasal epithelium [160], lung [145], and kidney [161], may increase the risk of S protein binding and the development of severe COVID-19 in older adults; however, this speculation remains controversial. Furthermore, intracellular cholesterol accumulates in type-2 pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages with ageing [162, 163]. As described above, a high cellular cholesterol level may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection by enhancing the S protein-ACE2 interaction [131, 132], consistent with the increase in poor COVID-19 outcomes in the aged population. Notably, age-related comorbidities, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, dementia, diabetes mellitus, kidney failure, cancer and metabolic syndrome, become more prevalent with ageing, and each of those pre-existing comorbidities increases the susceptibility to poor clinical outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection [164, 165]. In particular, memory impairment may affect the ability of elderly patients to comply with COVID-19 precautions, such as mask wearing, hand hygiene, and maintaining appropriate social distance. Together, these potential factors may individually or collectively render older individuals more vulnerable to coronavirus infection and lead to severe disease.",
            "Age is clearly a major risk factor for COVID-19, possibly due to the age-related dysfunction of the immune system, inflammation and comorbidities. However, the molecular mechanisms of age-related increases in disease vulnerability and severity are currently poorly understood, which would be an important area of investigation.",
            "Neuroinflammation is recognized as another characteristic pathophysiology of AD [166]. Microglia and astrocytes are major sources of cytokines in individuals with AD [167]. Dysfunction of the immune system may promote the release of proinflammatory cytokines and result in synaptic damage, neuronal death, and inhibition of neurogenesis, which are related to the pathogenesis of AD [168]. Although accumulating evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can enter the CNS, the presence of the virus in the brain may not critically correlate with the neurological conditions, as postmortem studies have noted occurrence of pronounced neuropathological changes even in patients with COVID-19 in whom the virus was not detected in the CNS [17, 19, 37, 169, 170]. Instead, extensive research on CSF and postmortem brain tissues has indicated that immune dysfunction and pronounced neuroinflammation within the CNS are the main driver of CNS damage and neurological symptoms in infected individuals. Neuroinflammation might result directly from coronavirus infection or from excessive peripheral inflammation. Both SARS-CoV-2 and proinflammatory mediators may promote BBB disruption, allowing the virus to cross the BBB, enter the CNS [171], and activate microglia and astrocytes, triggering a neuroinflammatory cascade that may contribute to the onset and progression of neurodegeneration [172–174] (Fig. 4).Fig. 4SARS-CoV-2 infection causes neurodegeneration by triggering neuroinflammation. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes activation of microglia and astrocytes, triggering a neuroinflammatory cascade. Activated microglia secrete inflammatory cytokines, which promote astrocyte activation and NLRP3 inflammasome formation. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 downregulates ACE2 expression, which may increase Ang II expression and subsequently activate AT1R in microglia, resulting in NF-κB expression and a proinflammatory response. On the other hand, downregulation of ACE2 activity is associated with decreased Ang (1–7) levels and subsequent MasR activity in astrocytes, which may lead to the production of ROS and proinflammatory factors in the CNS parenchyma and cerebral vessels. These processes result in Aβ deposition and tau phosphorylation, which ultimately lead to neurodegeneration and AD",

            "Under physiological conditions, microglia act as resident phagocytes in the CNS parenchyma, which are critical for homeostasis, facilitate synaptogenesis, regulate synaptic pruning and myelination, and subsequently support neuronal survival [175, 176]. Under pathological conditions, microglia rapidly respond to CNS pathogens or excessive peripheral inflammation by expressing specific surface receptors, driving morphological changes, and producing proinflammatory molecules and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which exacerbate neuroinflammation [177]. Microglia are likely to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain, as NRP-1, an important receptor for the virus, has recently been shown to be expressed in microglia [54]. Several previous studies have suggested that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 might function as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) to drive neuroinflammatory responses through activation of TLRs, which are widely expressed on macrophages and microglia and may function as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize molecular sequences common to bacterial and viral pathogens [178–180]. Microglia have been shown to express a wide range of PRRs, including TLRs, NOD-like receptors, RAGE and scavenger receptors [181]. SARS-CoV-2 activates these receptors, possibly eliciting neuroinflammatory responses and contributing to disease progression and severity. Widespread microglial activation, which may lead to activation of lymphocytes and T cells [17], has been observed in brains of the majority of patients with COVID-19 [182]. SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced activation of microglia may increase the expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, nitric oxide, and chemokine C–C motif ligand 2, which may further increase the AD-related tau pathology [183, 184]. In addition to being potential targets of coronaviruses, microglia are also highly susceptible to the effects of proinflammatory mediators. Studies have shown that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia are present in postmortem brain tissues of the majority of patients with COVID-19 and that these changes are not directly due to SARS-CoV-2 infection but likely result from systemic inflammation [185], as the viral RNA or protein is not detected in the microglial nodules or neuronophagic cells.",
            "Astrocytes are also important components of the intrinsic immune response in the CNS following viral infection. An increased plasma concentration of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a hallmark of astrocyte activation, is commonly detected in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 [186]. As components of the BBB, astrocytes are highly sensitive to peripheral inflammation. In addition to responding to signals from microglia, astrocytes also rapidly respond to proinflammatory cytokines secreted by endothelial cells. Astrocytes express inflammatory molecules that contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration upon exposure to activated proinflammatory microglia, including proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α; PAMPs; and danger-associated molecular patterns [187]. These data clearly indicate that microglia and astrocytes participate in neuroinflammatory responses to viral infection of the CNS.",
            "In addition, the systemic inflammatory response initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection is partially mediated by hyperactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome [188, 189]. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome decreases the phagocytosis of Aβ by microglia, thereby increasing the deposition of Aβ and subsequently facilitating the onset and development of AD pathology [190]. Hyperactivity of the intracellular NLRP3 inflammasome facilitates the polarization of microglia towards the M1 phenotype, resulting in Aβ deposition and increased cognitive deficits in transgenic AD mice [191]. Conversely, deficiency of the NLRP3 inflammasome results in the polarization of microglia towards the M2 phenotype, thus reducing the formation of Aβ plaques, inhibiting synaptic injury, and mitigating cognitive decline [192]. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has also been reported to promote tau pathology, which promotes the occurrence and progression of AD [193]. Furthermore, hyperactivation of P2X7 receptors has been reported to be closely associated with the inflammatory process, as P2X7 receptors are stimulated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released from damaged cells, inducing inflammasome activation [194]. The increase of extracellular ATP level caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger hyperactivation of the P2X7 receptor, leading to stimulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome [195]. In this context, the P2X7 receptor may be an appealing target for prevention or treatment of neurological manifestations of COVID-19. In addition, comorbidities, such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes and hypertension, which are related to poor outcomes, are associated with pronounced inflammation in patients with COVID-19 [196].",
            "Additionally, downregulation of ACE2 expression caused by binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein promotes cellular and tissue damage, possibly further aggravating neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and cerebrovascular endothelial injury. Oxidative stress and cyclooxygenase (COX)-1- or COX-2-mediated neuroinflammation are substantially inhibited in transgenic mice with neuron-specific overexpression of ACE2, resulting in improvement of the antioxidant status and nitric oxide homeostasis [197]. Therefore, pharmacological activation of ACE2 may exert beneficial effects on the neuropathological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection [198–200]. Moreover, neuroinflammation might result from dysregulation of the RAS in the CNS. As described above, SARS-CoV-2 binding downregulates ACE2 expression, which may increase the expression of Ang II and subsequently activate AT1R in microglia, resulting in promotion of NF-κB expression and proinflammatory responses. On the other hand, decreased ACE2 activity is associated with decreases of Ang (1–7) level and MasR activity in astrocytes, which may lead to the production of ROS and proinflammatory factors in the parenchyma and cerebral vessels of the CNS. Neurodegeneration may subsequently occur. Furthermore, abnormalities in the levels of CSF biomarkers, including increased level of inflammatory mediators, have been observed in patients with COVID-19, suggesting that the increased cytokine and chemokine levels in the CSF following virus infection may contribute to neuroinflammation [201–203].",
            "In addition to being a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases, hypertension has been demonstrated as a risk factor for AD [204]. Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs) are commonly used antihypertensive medications, and they have high affinity for AT1R, antagonizing the interaction between Ang II and its AT1R receptor. Regarding the effects of ARBs on AD, both in vitro and in vivo evidence has shown that treatment with ARBs can ameliorate most of the clinical risk factors of AD [205]. Although several studies failed to show restoration of spatial memory and learning deficiencies by the treatment [206, 207], an increasing number of studies reported that treatment with ARBs, such as losartan, candesartan, telmisartan, olmesartan or valsartan, is beneficial for memory and cognition in vivo [208–210]. In addition, administration of valsartan, losartan  or telmisartan  is capable of lessening the Aβ plaque burden [211, 212]. Evidence regarding the effect of ARBs on phosphorylated tau, another important hallmark of AD, is scarce. It seems that telmisartan is able to decrease the hippocampal content of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and neurofibrillary tangles [213, 214]. In addition to the aforementioned Aβ and tau, ARBs can also reduce neuroinflammation [206, 215]. Notably, a recent study investigated the effects of ARBs and ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) that are prescribed to treat COVID-19 in patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Although there was no significant relationship between ARB or ACEI use and the severity of COVID-19 among AD and MCI patients, the authors found that the ARBs were associated with a reduced risk for COVID-19 [216].",
            "In conclusion, neuroinflammation is caused both directly by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the CNS and indirectly by peripheral inflammation via immune-to-brain signalling. However, further research assessing the driver of the major pathological processes, the duration of neuroinflammation after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and whether this neuroinflammation exerts long-term effects on the nervous system is warranted.",
            "In addition to the connections described above, other factors responsible for the relationship between AD and COVID-19 are being explored. According to a recent study, Aβ42 increases SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection by strengthening the binding of the S1 subunit to the ACE2 receptor, suggesting that Aβ42 may play an important role in the development of severe COVID-19 [217]. Researchers also concluded that SARS-CoV-2 infection aggravates AD by exacerbating neurotoxicity and increasing the levels of Aβ, inflammation and oxidative stress [218, 219]. In addition, SARS-CoV-2-induced neuronal damage in 3D human brain organoids may be attributed to aberrant changes in the distribution and phosphorylation of tau [220]. Consistent with this study, SARS-CoV-2 infection activates biochemical pathways associated with tau pathology, which is one of the major factors that drive AD pathology [221]. Moreover, cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms make it difficult for AD patients to understand and follow safety measures [14]. All these factors reinforce the potential link between COVID-19 and AD.",
            "The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has extensively altered our daily lives. Infection is not only restricted to the respiratory system but also affects the CNS and leads to neurological manifestations. The morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19 are increased in patients with AD. The mechanism by which the virus gains access to the CNS and why patients with AD are at higher risk of virus infection are not well understood. In this review, we summarize the current literature on the possible routes by which SARS-CoV-2 invade the CNS and further analyse the shared aetiological cofactors and potential mechanisms linking COVID-19 and AD, which may advance our understanding of the inherent relationship between the two diseases. Although people infected with SARS-CoV-2 frequently display neurological symptoms, multiple manifestations remain unrecognized. First, neurological symptomatology is not always present, and neurological symptoms are often ignored because the first goal is to combat respiratory symptoms. In addition, clarifying the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 invades and spreads throughout the CNS is important for preventing and ameliorating neurological symptoms; however, the precise mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 invades the CNS has not been completely elucidated. Moreover, researchers have not clearly determined whether the neuropathological alterations are directly due to the neuroinvasion by the virus or caused indirectly by the dysregulation of the immune system following infection. Emerging studies are focusing on the effect of the coronavirus on the onset and progression of AD. However, as it has not been long since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, whether SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to long-term cognitive dysfunction and behavioural impairments in AD patients and triggers AD in infected individuals remain central questions. Therefore, long-term follow-up cohort studies designed to determine the long-term effects of COVID-19 on AD are urgently needed. Additionally, the relationships of AD-related pathological markers, risk factors and behavioural changes with COVID-19 must be further established. Moreover, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, new SARS-CoV-2 mutants (e.g., delta and omicron strains) will continue to emerge, and the ability of these mutants to infect the CNS and their effect on AD must be elucidated. In summary, studies are imperatively needed to clarify the potential mechanisms underlying the elevated susceptibility and mortality rate of AD patients to COVID-19 and discover preventive strategies to minimize the risk of viral infection among patients with AD.",

            "The recent outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus, has now spread quickly worldwide. Like the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), this novel type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been demonstrated to utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an entry point to the cells. There is a growing body of reports indicating that COVID-19 patients, especially those in severe condition, exhibit neurological symptoms, thus supporting the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could infect and damage neurons within the central nervous system in humans. Using human pluripotent stem cells-derived neurons, here we show the expression of ACE2 in human neurons via immunocytochemistry. From this perspective, we elaborate on the idea that the neuro-invasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 should be considered as a possible contributory factor, as well as a therapeutic target, for the severe respiratory symptoms in critical COVID-19 cases.",
            "In late December of 2019, clustering pneumonia cases caused by unknown etiology were firstly reported in the city of Wuhan, China. As of June 18th, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread in 213 countries and regions, with 8.5 million confirmed cases and 450,000 deaths. After ruling out SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus), COVID-19 was later identified to be caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (Lu et al. 2020). Due to the invasiveness of this virus to the respiratory system, symptoms of COVID-19 include coughing, high temperature, shortness of breath, and notably, loss of smell, which suggests possible infection of neurons (Giacomelli et al. 2020; Yan et al. 2020). Indeed, according to a recent study (Mao et al. 2020), SARS-CoV-2 exhibits neuro-invasive potential in COVID-19 patients, especially those in severe condition. Among the 214 cases of this study, 36.4% of the total patients were reported to have displayed neurological symptoms, meaning that 1 in 3 cases has involvement of the central nervous system (CNS).",
            "Similar to SARS-CoV, which caused the SARS epidemic in 2002–2003, SARS-CoV-2 also binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the lung to enter pulmonary cells, via its S1 spike protein (Wan et al. 2020), yet the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits higher affinity to ACE2 (Wrapp et al. 2020). ACE2 was originally discovered in 2000 in cardiac tissue and now has been established as a major component of the regulatory renin-angiotensin system (RAS) (Donoghue et al. 2000). In mammals, the RNA expression of ACE2 has been reported in multiple organs and variety of cell types. An early work has showed that the ACE2 expression in humans is mainly in the gastrointestinal (GI) system, heart, and the kidney (Harmer et al. 2002). Also, the data reported on “The Human Protein Atlas” (https://www.proteinatlas.org) indicate very little expression of ACE2 RNA in the CNS. However, the enzymatic activity of ACE2 has already been detected in human brain tissues and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Kehoe et al. 2016; Xu et al. 2017), indicating its significant level of protein expression within the human CNS.",
            "In human pluripotent stem cells (PSC)-derived mixed neurons, we have identified ACE2 expression via immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1a). The human neurons used here were generated from human PSC-derived neuronal precursor cells, and composed of a mixed population of forebrain-type (FOXG1-positive) neurons that are highly pure and functional. Similar to what we previously observed in mice (Doobay et al. 2007), ACE2 is robustly expressed in the cell body of the neurons, with less expression in the axons and dendrites. Although it is not human brain tissue, our data still provide evidence that ACE2 protein is expressed in human neurons, which is, consequently, a highly possible target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. So far, most of the known coronaviruses are neurotropic. For example, human coronavirus OC43 can propagate from neuron to neuron through axonal transportation (Dube et al. 2018). In mice, we have shown expression of ACE2 in neurons located in various pre-autonomic regions, such as the subfornical organ (SFO), paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN), solitary tract (NTS), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMNX), and the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) (Xia and Lazartigues 2010). Therefore, if the same pattern of ACE2 expression applies to humans, the SARS-CoV-2 infection in such neurons could contribute to the respiratory failure observed in the severe cases of COVID-19 (Fig. 1b): some patients were not gasping for air, despite their dangerously low blood oxygen levels. Indeed, SARS-CoV has been reported to infect the brain from both patients and experimental animals (Gu et al. 2005; Netland et al. 2008). In human ACE2 knock-in mice, SARS-CoV infection was significantly detected in the areas that involves cardiorespiratory regulation, including both hypothalamus and brainstem (Netland et al. 2008). Moreover, autopsy studies from the SARS patients revealed that SARS-CoV resides nearly exclusively in the neurons (Xu et al. 2005), rather than in other cell types, matching what we know about the expression profile of ACE2 within the CNS.Fig. 1ACE2 expresses in human neurons, therefore COVID-19 virus could invade the CNS, causing neurological symptoms and respiratory failure.

            "ACE2 is a cell surface-bound enzyme and can be secreted via ectodomain shedding. Whether the secreted ACE2 (i.e., shed) can be bound by the S1 protein is still unknown, there is a possibility that it may compete with the membrane-bound ACE2 for potential virus binding. In a correspondence by Batlle et al., the application of recombinant soluble ACE2 was discussed as a possible therapeutic approach for treating COVID-19 to avoid severe infection (Batlle et al. 2020). We previously reported markedly higher level of secreted ACE2 in the CSF of patients with uncontrolled hypertension (Xu et al. 2017), however, whether this increased ACE2 ectodomain shedding will affect the infection and mortality rates of hypertensive patients in the COVID-19 epidemic is still beyond investigation. Membrane-bound ACE2 also undergoes internalization. In ACE2-transfected Neuro-2A cells exposed to angiotensin-II, activation of the octapeptide receptor (AT1) was found to induce the internalization of ACE2 and its degradation into lysosomes (Deshotels et al. 2014). Since coronaviruses utilize ACE2 as a means to enter the cell, ACE2 internalization could also be related to the process of coronavirus infection. From this perspective, hypertensive patients, who have an overactive systemic or central RAS, might be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and under higher risk of transforming into severe cases. However, the usage of ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers is currently controversial, for their potentials in raising ACE2 levels, and the consequential possibility that the patients, who are treated with those anti-hypertensive drugs, might be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 1).Table 1Reported expression of ACE2 protein in human tissues and the corresponding COVID-19 symptomsTissue nameACE2 protein expressionACE2 protein expression levelsRelated COVID-19 symptomsDuodenum✓HighGI disturbanceGallbladder✓HighNAHeart✓HighHeart injuryKidney✓HighKidney injurySmall intestines✓HighDiarrhea and other GI disturbanceTestis✓HighNAAdrenal gland✓MediumNAColon✓MediumDiarrheaRectum✓MediumNABrain✓ (validated via enzymatic activity assays)LowLoss of taste or smell, respiratory failure, and other neurological symptomsLiver✓LowIncreased levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST)Lung✓LowPneumonia and respiratory symptomsOral mucosa✓LowNASeminal vesicleOnly in glandular cellsLowNASkin✓LowA rash on skin, or discoloration of fingers or toesSpleenOnly in vascular and red pulp sinus endotheliumLowNAEyeNANAConjunctivitisAdipose tissue×Common blood cells×Abnormal blood clottingEndometrium×Esophagus×Nasopharynx×Stomach×The data of ACE2 protein expression were obtained via published reports (Hamming et al. 2004; Kehoe et al. 2016; Xu et al. 2017; Hikmet et al. 2020) and version 19 of the Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org).

            "So far, there have been several theories regarding how SARS-CoV-2 invades the CNS. It was recently reported in Italy that about 34% of COVID-19 patients exhibited olfactory and/or taste disorders (Giacomelli et al. 2020). According to a study posted on medRxiv, both SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 RNAs were detected in the nasal epithelial cells in COVID-19 patients (Wu et al. 2020), confirming that SARS-CoV-2 did infect olfactory epithelium. Considering that intranasal drug delivery is able to bypass the blood–brain barrier (BBB) (Duchi et al. 2013), it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 could infect the brain through olfactory nerves located in the nasal cavity, like other neurotropic coronaviruses (Perlman et al. 1989). Additionally, in severe cases of COVID-19, hyperactivity of the immune system may trigger a \"cytokine storm\" (Savarin and Bergmann 2018), characterized by over-activation of immune cells and cytokine release, therefore contributing to a breakdown of the BBB and neuronal damage. Besides the nasal cavity and the BBB, there is another speculation, raised from previous studies on SARS-CoV, that the coronavirus could spread to the brainstem directly through mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors located in the lung and the lower respiratory tract (Hadziefendic and Haxhiu 1999). Although there has been a growing body of studies revealing the pathological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 (Natoli et al. 2020), the hypothesis proposed above still need to be validated in COVID-19 cases or animal models.",
            "The expression of ACE2 in human neurons brings up the neuro-invasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility that infected neurons could affect the patient’s ability to breathe and deteriorate respiratory function. This suggests that respiratory failure in severe COVID-19 cases might be treated from the perspective of the CNS.",

            "While many infectious disorders are unknown to most neurologists, COVID-19 is very different. It has impacted neurologists and other health care workers, not only in our professional lives but also through the fear and panic within our own families, colleagues, patients and their families, and even in the wider public. COVID-19 affects all sorts of individuals, but the elderly with underlying chronic conditions are particularly at risk of severe disease, or even death. Parkinson’s disease (PD) shares a common profile as an age-dependent degenerative disorder, frequently associated with comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular diseases, so PD patients will almost certainly fall into the high-risk group. Therefore, the aim of this review is to explore the risk of COVID-19 in PD based on the susceptibility to severe disease, its impact on PD disease severity, potential long-term sequelae, and difficulties of PD management during this outbreak, where neurologists face various challenges on how we can maintain effective care for PD patients without exposing them, or ourselves, to the risk of infection. It is less than six months since the identification of the original COVID-19 case on New Year’s Eve 2019, so it is still too early to fully understand the natural history of COVID-19 and the evidence on COVID-19-related PD is scant. Though the possibilities presented are speculative, they are theory-based, and supported by prior evidence from other neurotrophic viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Neurologists should be on high alert and vigilant for potential acute and chronic complications when encountering PD patients who are suspected of having COVID-19.",
            "By the time this article is published, the global community will be facing an unprecedented number of more than 2.4 million patients (April 22, 2020) who are infected with a novel zoonotic virus belonging to the coronavirus family, namely, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1,2]. From an epidemic of cases with unexplained lower respiratory infections detected in Wuhan, China at the beginning of December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 infection quickly spread to 213 countries and territories in less than six months (April 22, 2020) [1]. Specifically, in Asia, there are already 48 countries with over 400,000 confirmed cases, mostly residing in China, Iran, Turkey, South Korea, India, and Japan (April 22, 2020) (Figure 1). The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially called it ‘coronavirus disease 2019’ (COVID-19), declared it a public health emergency of international concern and finally a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1].",
            "COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disorder with symptoms ranging from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia and death (Figure 2) [3]. The median age of patients is 47–51 years with the majority of cases aged between 30–69 years; 51.1–58.9% of patients are male [3,4]. After an incubation period of an average of 5–6 days (range 1–14 days), most patients with COVID-19 (80%) develop mild-to-moderate disease with typical common signs and symptoms including fever (87.9%), dry cough (67.7%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.4%), shortness of breath (18.6%), sore throat (13.9%), myalgia and arthralgia (14.8%), headache (13.6%), and chills (11.4%) [4]. Approximately 13.8% go on to develop severe disease, which is defined by dyspnea, respiratory frequency > 30/min, blood oxygen saturation < 93%, PaO2/FiO2 < 300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field within 24–48 hours. An estimated 6.1% of cases are critical, characterized by respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ failure. A minority of patients (<5%) are either asymptomatic or die (crude fatality ratio, CFR 3.8%). Using available preliminary data from WHO, the median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately two weeks, and there is a three-to-six weeks recovery period for patients with severe or critical disease [4]. The time from onset to the development of severe disease is one week. So far, over 100,000 confirmed deaths have been reported by WHO, with the CFR varying by location, period, and intensity of transmission (April 13, 2020).",
            "What does this mean for neurologists? Neurologists may be involved in the care or management of COVID-19 patients in different situations. 1) COVID-19 is a pandemic, which means that neurologists in any part of the world are not excluded from the risk of exposure to the disease, either by encountering COVID-19 patients or infection from other modes of transmission. COVID-19 is transmitted via droplets and fomites during close unprotected contact between an infector and an infectee. Even though most infections were reported to occur within households rather than in health care settings, figures from China’s National Health Commission show that more than 3,300 health care workers had been infected as of early March 2020 and that 22 had died [4,5]. In Italy, 20% of responding health-care workers were infected, and some have died. As shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) remain an important issue, health care workers, including neurologists, should be aware of various protective measures when confronting patients with suspected infection so they can protect themselves and avoid passing the infection to their families [6]. 2) Neurologists may encounter individuals who are unaware they are infected, such as those who present with headache, which is observed in 13.6% of patients. Presymptomatic patients may also seek neurological or rhinological advice for the symptoms of hyposmia and hypogeusia, recognized in over 80% of COVID-19 patients, which can occur before the onset of other symptoms [7].",
            "3) Neurologists may be involved in the care of patients with the highest risk for severe disease, including people aged over 60 years and those with underlying conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer, when neurological presentations consist of alterations of consciousness and respiratory failure due to brainstem involvement [4,8]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also included people who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility as another risk factor for severe illness [9]. Although neurological disorders are not included in the highest risk category in the WHO report, the evidence is mounting that patients with chronic neurological disorders may be at risk for severe COVID-19. In addition to respiratory, fecal, and blood specimens, SAR-CoV-2 has recently been detected in the CSF of two patients with meningitis/encephalitis [10,11]. According to a mortality report from South Korea, patients with underlying neurological disorders of mainly dementia and stroke with an age of over 70 years represented 18.5% of all cases (10 out of 54 cases) [12].",
            "4) For those who survive, a spectrum of neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been reported in 36.4% of cases, ranging from dizziness, headache, hyposmia, hypogeusia, dysphagia, muscle pain, seizures, loss of consciousness, and nerve pain with the list continuing to grow [10,11,13-15]. Another series involving 58 patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection reported a much higher prevalence of neurological impairment in 49 patients (84%), consisting of encephalopathy, prominent agitation, confusion and corticospinal tract signs [16]. Neurological presentations were commonly observed in those with severe infection, with stroke being the most common etiology, but cases with encephalitis are also increasingly recognized [15,17]. Two cases of documented CSF invasion presenting with encephalitis and one possible case of acute necrotizing encephalopathy from cytokine storm syndrome following COVID-19 have been reported [10,11,14]. Evidence is also emerging that SARS-CoV-2 may enter the CNS through hematogenous or an upper nasal trancribial route that enables SARS-CoV-2 to reach the brain, or potentially peripheral terminals [18]. Another intriguing hypothesis is related to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to treat hypertension and diabetes [19]. As ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the use of ACE inhibitors could potentially lead to increased expression of ACE2, making the brain cells (e.g., endothelial cells in the brain, neurons, etc.) even more vulnerable to this viral infection. Clinical studies are currently underway to test this hypothesis.",
            "5) Finally, since the best preventative measure is to avoid being exposed to the virus, neurologists should strictly follow preventive and control measures, which may have significant impact on how they manage their patients either as in- or out-patients. Moreover, neurologists should be ready to prepare and adopt certain initiatives to ensure that they are safe, but, at the same time, patients’ neurological care is not neglected or ignored during this challenging period [20,21].",
            "As PD patients share common characteristics with reported COVID-19 patients in terms of age, comorbidities, and a risk of respiratory dysfunction, it is plausible that PD patients or at least certain PD populations (e.g., advanced stage) may be at potential risk for severe COVID-19. The aim of this review is to explore the risk of COVID-19 in PD based on the susceptibility to severe disease, its impact on PD disease severity, potential long-term sequelae, and challenges of PD management during this outbreak, where neurologists need to balance how we can maintain effective care for PD patients without exposing them, or ourselves, to the risk of COVID-19.",
            "A 77-year-old Korean man with Parkinson’s disease dementia was admitted to the emergency room with alteration of consciousness on February 23, 2020. His past medical history was significant for coronary artery disease (CAD). At admission, he was minimally responsive and hypotensive (61/35, PR = 79/min) with a body temperature of 36°C. He had tachypnea (RR = 26/min) with oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. A diagnosis of septicemia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was suspected and he was treated with inotropes, antibiotics, and respiratory support.",
            "Chest computed tomography revealed diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities and RT-PCR assays of the throat and nasal swab samples were reported two days later as positive for SARS-CoV-2, confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19. The family decided against resuscitation and he was given supportive treatment, without a ventilator, in a negative pressure isolation room. He died six days after admission from respiratory failure (Personal communication with Prof. Ho-Won Lee, Kyungpook National University Chilgok Hospital, South Korea).",
            "This case illustrates an example of a critical COVID-19 patient who fulfilled the risk criteria for severe disease, including old age and cardiovascular disease. This case also provides perspectives that we can all learn from in terms of the understanding and treatment of this disease, as well as preventive precautions for family members and wider society. From the underlying disease perspective, a cardiovascular disorder comorbidity is considered a high risk for severe disease, with the prevalence of cardiovascular disease reported as between 2.5–12.1% of patients with COVID-19 [3,22]. Compared to the overall CFR of 3.8%, the presence of comorbid conditions significantly increases the CFR, with the highest for cardiovascular disease (13.2%), followed by diabetes (9.2%), hypertension (8.4%), chronic respiratory disorder (8.0%), and cancer (7.6%) [4]. CFR can also increase with age, with the highest mortality observed among people over 80 years (CFR 21.9%) as well as male sex (CFR 4.7%) and retirees (CFR 8.9%) [4]. Although PD is not included as a risk factor for severe disease, PD was mentioned as an underlying disorder associated with mortality in some case series, such as in our case vignette [23].",
            "Whether PD itself poses a risk for severe disease is not entirely clear. Based on published literature since the identification of COVID-19, there is no conclusive evidence of such a risk in PD. The experience from the three most heavily affected regions in Italy does not show an apparent increased risk, although there are no systematic data available [24]. While the risk cannot be confirmed for the whole PD population, there are several theoretical possibilities that a risk for severe disease may still occur in certain PD subgroups. Indirect risk can be estimated through the strong link between PD and a number of comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease. Several cardiac abnormalities have been observed in PD patients, including cardiac autonomic dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, CAD, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death [25]. While the associations between cardiovascular risk factors and PD are not straightforward, the link between cardiovascular disease and PD may be related to a shared sedentary lifestyle in both conditions [26]. In addition, diabetes and cerebrovascular disease are also identified as frequent comorbidities in PD patients and are recognized risk factors for severe disease with COVID-19 [27,28].",
            "Direct risk for a severe disease with COVID-19 is likely to occur in a subgroup of PD patients, particularly those with respiratory dysfunction. Indeed, dyspnea is a common symptom in PD, observed in 39.2% of patients without a history of lung or heart disease [29]. With frequent cardio-pulmonary comorbidities among PD patients, the number of PD patients with dyspnea is likely to be higher in clinical practice than that observed in clinical trials. When comorbidities are excluded, dyspnea in PD is primarily associated with advanced disease with contributing factors from respiratory muscle weakness, axial manifestations, and abnormal posture (e.g., camptocormia, stoop), causing respiratory muscle rigidity and poor respiratory excursions, finally resulting in ventilatory failure [29,30]. In PD, dyspnea may also occur as part of nonmotor fluctuations, frequently associated with anxiety and depression [31]. Furthermore, the presence of restrictive or obstructive respiratory dysfunction can potentially predispose PD patients to sleep apnea, further compromising these patients’ night-time breathing function [32]. While inspiratory muscle weakness may be clinically evident in advanced stage patients, it has recently been found to be present at a subclinical level in early stage patients whose pulmonary function tests did not disclose any restrictive or obstructive disorders [33]. Central effects of respiratory dysfunction in PD cannot be discounted as an early stage of neurodegeneration in PD also involving brainstem nuclei, affecting the respiratory center in the medulla, which is also targeted by SARS-CoV-2 infection [8]. Therefore, PD patients with underlying respiratory dysfunction could be at significant risk of respiratory failure if infected by SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Pneumonia was identified as the foremost reason for hospital admissions and the most common cause of death among PD patients [34,35]. The inverse association also demonstrates that PD by itself confers a higher probability of dying from pneumonia [36]. As PD progresses, mastication is affected and swallowing is impaired by bradykinesia, rigidity, and dyskinesia, causing pooling of saliva in the mouth, leading to drooling or aspiration of secretions [37,38]. This is important as aspiration of saliva may also occur in between meals. In advanced patients who are weak and frail, their cough becomes weaker because of chest wall rigidity and decreases in the sensory component of the cough reflex. This combination represents a perfect scenario for aspiration pneumonia. As COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing ultimately infecting alveolar epithelial cells, PD patients may predispose themselves to severe pneumonia by aspirating infected secretions into the lower respiratory tract. However, while this mechanism may seem plausible, there is no published literature supporting this association in PD patients with COVID-19.",
            "Relative to viruses that cause human upper respiratory tract infection, viruses that cause lower respiratory tract infection are smaller and their infections are mostly limited to tracheobronchitis in healthy individuals but can cause viral pneumonias in immunocompromised patients. Before the outbreak of COVID-19, the most frequent virus that caused acute lower respiratory infections in China was respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but influenza viruses were the main cause in adults and the elderly [39]. Human coronavirus represented only a minority (1.4%) within this Chinese cohort. If we assume that PD represents a risk for severe disease consisting of pneumonia and ARDS with COVID-19, it is important to determine the immune status responses in general PD populations or certain PD subgroups to identify if they are immunocompromised. Indeed, the concern whether PD can lower immunity in affected patients, making them more susceptible to COVID-19, was recently shared by PD patients and caregivers [40]. Importantly, evidence of dysregulation of immune responses in patients with severe COVID-19 infection is emerging, characterized by elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines, including a low number of T cells in more debilitating and severe cases [41]. Both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were found to be below normal levels, with the lowest level of helper T cells in the severe group. In severe cases, the percentage of memory helper and regulatory T cells was also decreased. As PD typically affects people from the sixth decade of life, it is also important to determine a state of immunosenescence, which is associated with dramatic changes in the distribution and competence of immune cells, leading to the loss of adaptive immunity and the gain of nonspecific innate immunity, leaving older individuals susceptible to infection and cancer and unprotected from chronic tissue inflammation [42]. The cooccurrence of weakened adaptive immunity with a bias toward nonspecific tissue inflammation (‘inflammaging’) probably explains why the elderly, particularly those above 80 years, are highly susceptible to severe COVID-19.",
            "To adequately address this question, we need to determine various aspects of how COVID-19 by itself and by environmental and social factors could have an effect on PD patients (Figure 3). At this moment, there are no available data that provide sufficient information on how COVID-19 itself has an effect on parkinsonian symptoms except for scattered mortality case reports, which include PD among many other underlying disorders. While this lack of information may be interpreted as there being no significant effect of COVID-19 on the overall symptoms of PD patients, it is probably too early to estimate this association and neurologists should be on high alert to evaluate parkinsonian symptoms comprehensively with a particular emphasis on respiratory function for those infected with SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Despite a lack of specific data on COVID-19, the available evidence indicates that PD patients can deteriorate following systemic infections [43]. The clinical spectrum of this phenomenon is wide, ranging from mild worsening to akinetic crisis [43]. Fever and delirium are two of the most important factors found to be associated with motor deterioration and respiratory tract infection found to be the most common contributor [44,45]. As fever is the most common symptom of COVID-19, observed in 87.9% of affected patients and up to 12.3% experience a high fever of more than 39.0°C, there is a strong possibility of subacute worsening of parkinsonism for PD patients with COVID-19 [3,4]. The prevalence of this phenomenon was found to be between 25–32.5% with advanced disease, characterized by long disease duration, high Hoehn & Yahr (HY) stage, cognitive dysfunction, and high dopaminergic medication dosages as potential risk factors [44,45]. The combination of fever and altered dopaminergic medication intake can potentially predispose PD patients to Parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome, which is a movement disorder emergency, requiring immediate and aggressive management [46]. Despite improvement of the underlying infection, not all PD patients with this phenomenon fully recover, and some are left with significant disability. Fatal cases have also been reported [45]. The mechanisms underlying this motor deterioration are likely to be complex with variable contributions from individual cases, but include altered medication intake during systemic illnesses, changes in the pharmacodynamics of dopaminergic medications, altered dopamine metabolism in the brain, peripheral inflammatory processes or circulating toxins or cytokines [43]. Therefore, PD patients who possess these risks should be carefully observed and monitored for motor deterioration during a period of active SARS-CoV-2 infection, which should also be extended into the convalescence period.",
            "The impact of universal preventative measures for COVID-19 exposure on symptoms, functions, activities and stress of PD patients should not be ignored [47]. Advice for everybody to ‘stay-athome’ can limit patient’s outdoor physical activities and mobility, resulting in a sedentary lifestyle for some patients, potentially leading to worsening outcomes. Social distancing limits face-to-face family visits to patients who live alone, and may result in feelings of loneliness and depression. When patients stay at home, they are more likely to spend more time watching the television, listening to the radio and using social media with their 24-hour broadcasting of COVID-19 situations, potentially increasing psychological stress, worsening anxiety and depression that are already common nonmotor symptoms in PD patients. With high levels of fear, PD patients and their families may not think clearly and rationally when reacting to COVID-19, potentially leading to other psychosocial challenges, including stigmatization and discrimination [48]. Psychological stress can affect various motor symptoms, such as tremor, gait, and dyskinesia, as well as reduce the efficacy of dopaminergic medications [49,50].",
            "So far, no reports of acute parkinsonism following COVID-19 have been reported in the literature. It remains to be seen if SARS-CoV-2 can induce parkinsonism following an episode of encephalitis. The issue of a viral etiology of encephalitis lethargica and postencephalitic parkinsonism continues to be a matter of debate. Much of the linkage of parkinsonism with influenza and many other viruses stem from an outbreak of encephalitis lethargica (EL), also known as von Economo’s disease, and postencephalitic parkinsonism that occurred subsequent to the 1918 pandemic influenza outbreak caused by a type A H1N1 influenza virus [51]. The cause of EL and the link to subsequent postencephalitic parkinsonism remains controversial with clinical features showing both similarities and distinct symptomatology to PD. Following an acute episode, the chronic phase of postencephalitic parkinsonism developed one to five years later, but it could also follow immediately, or more than a decade later, with typical clinical presentations involving upper limb bradykinesia and stiffness associated with frequent episodes of kinesia paradoxica, oculogyric crisis, and psychiatric disturbances [52]. Perhaps, EL is not necessarily a prerequisite to developing postencephalitic parkinsonism, but merely a contributing factor [52]. Although direct evidence for influenza virus has never been substantiated in these cases, proving a negative is also difficult. Despite the etiological controversy, people born during the time of the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918 have a two-to-three fold-increased risk of PD than those born prior to 1888 or after 1924 [53-55]. While EL and COVID-19 involve different primary organs for their clinical manifestations, they are both pandemics affecting more than one million people with a link to neurotrophic viruses. In addition to parkinsonism, there is a theoretical possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to accelerated CNS aging in survivors, which could manifest months or years after the infection [56]. Therefore, the medical community should be cautious of neurological comorbidities of COVID-19 that may occur following an outbreak.",
            "As the outbreak of COVID-19 continues globally, neurologists face challenges with new tasks related to the care of COVID-19 patients and existing tasks in providing a continuum of care for their neurological patients, but in a very different situation from their usual clinical practice. Most of the adjustments were not planned in advance and involve maximizing and reallocating human, clinical, and research resources to the priority list of taking care of COVID-19 patients. Undoubtedly, these changes not only affect the routine care of PD patients but also highlight a number of important issues that neurologists should be aware of or consider implementing during this outbreak.",
            "As mentioned above, PD patients may experience a subacute worsening of their condition, especially motor symptoms, during systemic infections, potentially as a result of altered medication intake and changes in the pharmacodynamics of dopaminergic medications. For those with mild symptoms of COVID-19, patients should be advised to observe their symptoms closely and to seek consultation if their condition, particularly respiratory symptoms, significantly worsen. While most dopaminergic medications can be continued during a period of systemic infections without any absolute contraindications, caution should be noted with the use of cough syrup containing dextromethorphan and cyclobenzaprine or nasal decongestants containing pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, and phenylpropanolamine with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (e.g., selegiline and rasagiline) for potential drug interactions that can intensify sympathomimetic activities [57].",
            "Antiviral (e.g., favipiravir, atazanavir, iopinavir/ritonavir) and anti-malarial (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) drugs are being tested for COVID-19 without any specific interactions with dopaminergic medications reported. Therapeutic implications of amantadine, an agent that can block a pore in the envelope protein of SARS-CoV and is no longer used as an antiinfluenza agent due to its high resistance, remain unexplored as a potential treatment of COVID-19 [58].",
            "Patients with device-aided therapies, including deep brain stimulation (DBS), apomorphine and levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusions may encounter problems related to hardware, acute adverse events, or severe symptom fluctuations during this outbreak [59-61]. While the recommendations are to postpone device-aided therapies for all new cases, acute problems may arise among those who are already on one of these treatments where immediate interventions may be necessary. For example, if the battery for a DBS system stops working completely and the DBS is no longer effective, patients may experience a significant return of PD symptoms. Although most DBS procedures are considered elective, it is not an elective procedure if it is the end of battery life. In these situations, decisions should be made individually by taking into consideration the risk of complications, exposure risk to COVID-19 for both patients and health care workers, and the availability of all resources to treat that particular complication during this outbreak. In places where there are no limitations of resources, elective procedures can be resumed but full consultations with various experts and appropriate health authorities should be undertaken to ensure that it is safe to do so.",
            "Another challenge for us as neurologists is how to maintain effective care for PD patients without exposing them to the risk of COVID-19 in the hospital. CDC recommends healthcare facilities delay elective ambulatory provider visits and adjust the way they triage, assess, and care for patients by using methods that do not rely on face-to-face care, such as the use of telemedicine [62]. Telemedicine encompasses a broad range of health care tools, including real-time interactive or synchronous audio and video communications between a patient and a provider (e.g., video conferencing, smartphone health care applications), and other telehealth services, such as simple telephone communication, email and text messages, and remote monitoring of patient data from wearables [20]. Previous studies have suggested that telemedicine for PD is feasible when delivered either in the home or in an off-site clinic or nursing home setting [63]. Most studies have also reported that an adequate and reliable motor examination can be performed via telemedicine with the motor section of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) [64-66]. However, limitations remain for the examination of rigidity, postural instability, and cognitive dysfunction [67]. Benefits with telemedicine are also extended to cost savings, reduction in travel distance, and a reduction in time spent attending appointments [63]. Moreover, rehabilitation and allied health services can be delivered remotely with success stories demonstrated on the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment and physical therapy assessments [68,69]. In general, patient’s views on telemedicine have been favorable for the main advantages, including access to specialists and convenience, but tempered by the concern of loss of hands on care [70]. However, issues with laws, regulations, policies and patient’s confidentiality with telemedicine need to be addressed by the parties involved.",
            "While many infectious disorders are unknown to most neurologists, COVID-19 is very different. It has made itself known to neurologists and other health care workers not only in their professions but also because of the fear and panic caused within our own families, colleagues, patients and their families, and the wider public. Since the identification of SARS-CoV-2 on New Year’s Eve 2019, it has spread to 213 countries on almost all continents in less than six months and was declared by WHO as a global pandemic. During this time period, COVID-19 has shown that it is not just a respiratory disorder as neurological complications start to emerge, ranging from mild headache and dizziness to acute encephalitis and loss of consciousness. COVID-19 affects all individuals, but it causes high mortality among the elderly and those with various underlying chronic medical conditions. PD patients are probably included in this at-risk group and the whole PD community should act together to understand, prevent, and protect themselves from COVID-19. If prevention is not possible and PD patients get infected, they should be closely monitored for worsening of their parkinsonian symptoms and signs of severe disease, especially with respect to respiratory function. It is likely that advanced PD patients with existing underlying respiratory dysfunction are particularly at-risk for severe disease and eventually respiratory and multiorgan failure. Those elderly PD patients with comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes) will have a mortality risk that is even higher. While no specific treatments are yet available, prompt supportive management of respiratory function is likely to influence outcomes. Based on its nature of neurotropism, sequelae may start to reveal themselves with time. Some early evidence of hyposmia and encephalitis are important clues that neurologists should continue to follow COVID-19 patients even though they are seronegative and discharged home since long-term complications, including parkinsonism, are all possible.",

            "SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via its spike protein binding to its surface receptor on target cells and results in acute symptoms involving especially the lungs known as COVID-19. However, increasing evidence indicates that many patients develop a chronic condition characterized by fatigue and neuropsychiatric symptoms, termed long-COVID. Most of the vaccines produced so far for COVID-19 direct mammalian cells via either mRNA or an adenovirus vector to express the spike protein, or administer recombinant spike protein, which is recognized by the immune system leading to the production of neutralizing antibodies. Recent publications provide new findings that may help decipher the pathogenesis of long-COVID. One paper reported perivascular inflammation in brains of deceased patients with COVID-19, while others showed that the spike protein could damage the endothelium in an animal model, that it could disrupt an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and that it can cross the BBB resulting in perivascular inflammation. Moreover, the spike protein appears to share antigenic epitopes with human molecular chaperons resulting in autoimmunity and can activate toll-like receptors (TLRs), leading to release of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, some antibodies produced against the spike protein may not be neutralizing, but may change its conformation rendering it more likely to bind to its receptor. As a result, one wonders whether the spike protein entering the brain or being expressed by brain cells could activate microglia, alone or together with inflammatory cytokines, since protective antibodies could not cross the BBB, leading to neuro-inflammation and contributing to long-COVID. Hence, there is urgent need to better understand the neurotoxic effects of the spike protein and to consider possible interventions to mitigate spike protein-related detrimental effects to the brain, possibly via use of small natural molecules, especially the flavonoids luteolin and quercetin.",
            "The SARS-CoV-2 infects cells by first binding to its surface receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), via its corona spike protein [1]. The S protein is trimeric and catalyzed fusion between the viral and host cell membrane; this “prefusion” trimer has three receptor-binding domains (RBD), while the post fusion structure expresses N-linked glycans that may serve to protect against immune responses [2]. Infection then leads to a complex immune response that involves the release of a “storm” [3, 4] of pro-inflammatory cytokines [3–11], especially IL-6 [12–15] and IL-1β [16, 17] leading to the development of COVID-19 [3, 18]. Most infected patients develop antibodies against the spike protein, but immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 may involve more than neutralizing antibodies [19].",
            "A prospective study of more than 3,000 healthy members of the US Marines Corps concluded that those seropositive could still be infected but had only 20% the risk of subsequent re-infection as compared to those who were seronegative [20]. It is not known if individuals who get re-infected do not mount sufficient neutralizing antibodies or lack some other aspect of antiviral immunity. New data from immunized individuals indicate that the rate of re-infection varies depending on the type of vaccine used [21]. There is emerging evidence of reduced neutralization of some SARS-CoV-2 variants [22].",
            "Some of the damaging effects of SARS-CoV-2, especially in the brain, may be due to direct action of the Spike protein, acting alone or in conjunction with other mediators such as inflammatory cytokines, on target cells.",
            "It is now recognized that many patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop a post-acute syndrome a few months after the initial infection known as “post-acute COVID” [23] or “long-COVID” [23–26]. Long-COVID occurs in 30–50% of COVID patients [23, 27–30] and is characterized by multisystem symptoms, primarily persistent fatigue and cognitive impairment [31] that varied considerably among patients [32] and were more common with increasing age and female sex [29]. These persistent symptoms should not be confused or misinterpreted as persistent infection that has been reported in immunocompromised hosts [33]. Nevertheless, patients with long-COVID have not recovered even by 7 months post infection and continue to suffer mostly from systemic and neurological symptoms [34].",
            "Long-COVID is particularly associated with neurological [35–43], neurodegenerative [38, 44, 45], psychiatric [46–52], and cognitive [47–57] problems, especially brain fog [23, 25, 26, 46, 58–62]. In fact, over 90% of patients who were initially hospitalized for COVID-19 and had neurological symptoms had significantly worse outcome 6 months later [63]. Even though some of the mental fatigue experienced by long-haulers may be due to the perceived stress [64], the extent of this disability is unlike any other medical condition known.",
            "In spite of early impressions that long-COVID may develop only in those patients who were hospitalized and intubated, increasing evidence indicates that long-COVID can develop regardless of the severity of the original symptoms [61, 65] and has been considered the “next health disaster” in the USA [66]. So far the duration of long-COVID symptoms is not known, but recent data indicate that it may depend on antigen persistence [67] and a sustained specific immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 [68].",
            "The neurologic effects of COVID-19 may be due to SARS-CoV-2 entering the brain, but the pathways of such neurotropism are still unclear [69, 70]. One possibility is that the virus crosses or damages the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [71], accompanied by basement membrane disruption, in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 [72]. Similar findings were reported independently, and it was also shown that the virus was detected in human cortical neurons [73]. In another study, a fragment specific to SARS-CoV-2 was amplified from cultures of a brain specimen from a deceased patient with COVID-19, and associated pathology showed neuronal necrosis and glial cell hyperplasia [74]. Alternatively, the virus could enter from the nose by crossing the neural-mucosal interface of the olfactory nerve [75] and enter the brain via the olfactory nerve tract [76]. Viral entry into the brain via gustatory-olfactory trigeminal pathway eventually compromising the BBB was recently reported in deer mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 [77]. It is interesting that single-cell RNA sequencing showed that ACE2 was not expressed by olfactory sensory or bulb neurons but instead was expressed by olfactory epithelium and pericytes [78].",
            "The effect of SARS-CoV-2 to the brain is also not well understood. One paper showed the presence of megakaryocytes in cortical capillaries that could lead to brain ischemia [79] and subsequent cerebrovascular events [80–82]. In the autopsy report of an infant who died with COVID-19, there was evidence of cortical atrophy and severe neuronal loss, and findings were restricted to capillaries of the choroid plexus [83]. A recent paper did not document any molecular traces of SARS-CoV-2 in the brains of deceased patients with COVID-19, but detected choroid plexus perturbations associated with pathologic morphological changes in the microglia [84]. In addition to the evidence discussed above of neuronal damage due to SARS-CoV-2, a paper reported that the virus can enter a 3D human brain organoid and preferentially targets neurons resulting in their death [85]. Such pathology may be explained by the expression of the ACE2 receptor by human glial cells and neurons [86], exacerbated through the activation of the complement and kinin systems [87].",
            "Increasing evidence indicates the involvement of neuro-inflammation [71, 88, 89] that may damage brain blood vessels [90, 91], as well as brain cells [88, 92, 93], possibly via activation of microglia [94, 95] and mast cells [96]. In fact, long-COVID could be considered a state of “brain autoimmunity” [22].",
            "In summary, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 to the brain could be direct via invasion or indirect effect via damaging endothelial cells and pericytes or via activation of neuroimmune responses as has been invoked for neurologic complications following HIV [97].",
            "An alternative explanation of the CNS effect of SARS-CoV-2 may be due to direct effects of the spike protein. The spike protein is made up of the S1 subunit containing a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that attaches to ACE2 and the S2 subunit containing a transmembrane anchor that mediates fusion of viral and host cell membranes [1]. Most infected patients develop antibodies that neutralize the spike protein to various extents. A recent paper reported that blood of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 contained, in addition to antibodies against the RBD that were protective, also antibodies against the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein that induced the open conformation of the RBD enhancing its binding ability and infectivity in vitro using cultured cells [98]. A more recent study of molecular modeling using an antibody from a symptomatic COVID-19 patient concluded that there was higher NTD binding with the delta variant resulting in antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [99]. Such interactions, where antibodies can neutralize one serotype but are less potent at neutralizing another, are known to increase the chances of ADE to the new serotype [100]. Even though ADE remains controversial, a recent paper reported that virus-mimicking anti-idiotype antibodies present after infection or after vaccination may potentially explain long-COVD symptoms [101]. These findings may potentially explain why those vaccinated against the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 strain and then exposed to the Delta variant may still get infected. Al alternative or additional explanation may be the fact that immunity to vaccines has been reported to decrease over time [102, 103]",
            "It is not yet known if the spike protein is released extracellularly after the SARS-CoV-2 infects its target cells. Given the absence of infection of the brain discussed above, the neuropathologic findings may be due to the SARS-C0V-2 spike protein. Indirect evidence of its presence within the CNS may be the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the CSF of two children who died with COVID-10 and had subacute neuropsychiatric symptoms [104], even though such antibodies may had crossed a disrupted BBB. Free spike protein could have a number of direct pathologic actions on different cell types (Fig. 1A). These include direct stimulation of peripheral nerves [105] and stimulation of release of pro-inflammatory and vasoactive mediators [106, 107], especially platelet-activating factor (PAF) [108, 109].Fig. 1.A Diagrammatic representation of how SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can stimulate different cell types and collectively contribute to the pathogenesis of long-COVID. B Diagrammatic representation of how SARS-CoV-2 can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through endothelial cell gaps or how free spike protein can damage the integrity of the BBB and enter the brain.",

B Diagrammatic representation of how SARS-CoV-2 can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through endothelial cell gaps or how free spike protein can damage the integrity of the BBB and enter the brain.",
            "A number of papers have reported direct pathologic effect of the spike protein by itself (without being part of the coronavirus). One paper reported that the spike protein could damage the endothelium in an animal model [110], while another paper showed that recombinant S1 RBD can damage mouse brain endothelial cells in vitro by inducing degradation of endothelial junction proteins, thus affecting endothelial barrier function [111]. A recent paper reported rapid internalization of S1 RBD and of the spike RBD active trimer by cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells, followed by increased permeability of transferrin and dextran, as well as mitochondrial damage [112]. Another recent paper using a 3D-BBB microfluidic model showed that S1 upregulated ACE2 expression and triggered RhoA activation, a key molecule regulating endothelial cytoskeleton [113]. Yet, another paper reported that spike-transfected human epithelial cells showed increased senescence-associated secretory and inflammatory proteins [114].",
            "Two other papers reported that the spike protein could disrupt the barrier function in an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [115] and that the S1 protein can actually cross the BBB and enter the brain in mice [116] (Fig. 1A). Using transgenic mice expressing the human sigma protein, it was shown that intranasal infection with SARS-CoV-2 rapidly induced ischemic-like reactivity in brain pericytes and the S protein reached the brain of the mice [117].",
            "In addition to direct damage, the spike protein appears to share antigenic epitopes with human molecular chaperons resulting in autoimmunity against endothelial cells [118]. Moreover, a recent paper showed that spike epitopes could form heterodimeric complexes with selected human glial proteins [119]. Interestingly, it was shown that three recombinant sigma protein peptides exhibited molecular interactions with acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzymes both in silico and in tad poles in vivo [120].",
            "Interestingly, symptoms experienced by long-COVID patients, especially cognitive dysfunction [121–123], are similar [106] to those present in patients with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) [124, 125], in whom mast cells can be stimulated by environmental and stress triggers [126], including viruses [127] such as SARS-CoV-2 [107, 128]. Mast cells are located perivascularly in close proximity to neurons, especially in the hypothalamus [129, 130], where functional mast cell-neuron interactions have been documented [130, 131]. Mast cells also interact with microglia [132] leading to their activation [133] and neuro-inflammation [134].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 binding may not be limited to the ACE2 receptor. New evidence indicates that the spike protein also binds to heparan sulfate (HS) molecules expressed on the surface of target cells, with mutant variants having higher binding affinity to HS [135]. This binding may be due to the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains four more positively charged and five fewer negatively charged residues than SARS-CoV, thus increasing the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for HS [136]. Apparently, binding to HS allows the virus to reach the ACE2 receptor, and the RBD portion of the spike protein can engage both HS and ACE2 without dissociation of one or the other ligand [137]. The S1 subunit can also bind to the surface glycoprotein neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), thus increasing infectivity, but also dysregulating angiogenesis, immune responses, and neuronal development [138, 139]. Different coronavirus variants have evolved more efficient electrostatic interactions to allow them to bind to the ACE2 receptor [140]. SARS-CoV-2 also appears to become “pre-activated” by the proprotein convertase furin, thus bypassing the target cell proteases for entry [141].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 can do additional damage by activating toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR2, leading to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines independent of viral entry [142, 143]. Such immune-mediating molecules could contribute to neurologic symptoms [144] as a result of or in addition to the action of the spike protein. Moreover, activating TLR4 increases expression of ACE2 [145] further enhancing viral infectivity in an autocrine loop. Activation of TLRs may not only involve activation of inflammasomes [146], but also activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex [147, 148], which is invoked in the pathogenesis of many neuropsychiatric diseases [149] (Fig. 2). Increased levels of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been detected in the CSF of COVID-19 patients [150], especially IL-6 [150, 151]. In fact, use of an anti-IL-6 antibody or IL-6 receptor antibody reduced neuronal injury in a mouse model, accompanied by inflammation and neuronal death unrelated to hypoxia [152]. Integration of serum levels of IL-6 and heparin-binding protein were shown to have significant predictive value for severity of COVID-19 [153].Fig. 2.Diagrammatic representation of how SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can stimulate endothelial cells, mast cells, microglial cells, and neurons first by binding to the ACE2 receptor costimulated by binding to heparin sulfate, and then acted upon by a serine protease before entering the nucleus. SARS-CoV-2 can also stimulate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and lead to the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines via activation of the inflammasomes and or mTOR. The diagram also shows the targets of the inhibitory actions of luteolin, methoxyluteolin, and quercetin (green line), which may be used to prevent or treat the development of long-COVID.",

            "A recent paper reported cloning and expressing 26 of the 29 proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome and showed most proteins, especially non-structural protein (NSP) 2, 5, and 7, induced significant changes in endothelial permeability [154]. These findings imply that SARS-CoV2-associated proteins other than the spike protein may contribute to pathologic effects on their own, sequentially or synergistically with the structural sigma protein.",
            "Lastly, a recent paper analyzed human fetal expression of six different S protein “interactors” and showed weak expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but high expression of furin with peak expression 12–26 weeks post conception; moreover, using publically available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, it was shown that these interactors showed higher co-expression with neurons [155]. This finding indicates that the spike protein can adversely affect the developing brain and potentially lead to neurologic complications in neonates of infected mothers [156], including autism spectrum disorder [157].",
            "A major unaddressed issue, especially with respect to the pathogenesis of long-COVID, is whether the spike protein that enters the brain or is expressed in neurons and glial cells can activate microglia directly or via stimulation of mast cells leading to neuro-inflammation [158]. This pathogenetic process would go on unhindered in the absence of any neutralizing antibodies since they do not cross the BBB, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of long-COVID. Moreover, such spike protein-induced neurocognitive damage could be worse in vulnerable populations like those with minimal cognitive impairment [159] or others suffering from traumatic brain injury [160].",
            "There are presently no biologics that can block SARS-CoV-2 binding to its receptor(s). Certain biologics aimed at blocking IL-6 [161] or IL-1 [162] have been reported to improve clinical status of patients with COVID-19 However, a meta-analysis of clinical trials using IL-6 antagonists as an add-on to usual care did not reduce the risk of stroke [163], and a recent double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study showed no benefit of an Il-6 blocker [164]. This conclusion may not be surprising as these humanized antibodies are not likely to cross the BBB unless it has already been disrupted. It is interesting that a main source of IL-6 is the mast cells [165–167], which have been reported to secrete it after stimulation with IL-1 [168] and acute stress [169]. Moreover, IL-6 can be constitutively released from human mast cells bearing the D816V-KIT mutation [170] and act on mast cell in an autocrine fashion to stimulate their proliferation [171].",
            "This manuscript does not attempt to review and discuss all possible drugs, biologics, or natural molecules that could interfere with SARS-CoC-2 binding and its effects on target cells. Rather, it focuses on certain natural molecules for which there is sufficient basic and clinical evidence supporting their possible usefulness, both in prevention and treatment, especially in long-COVID. A number of recent reviews have discussed the potential use of natural molecules in that capacity [172–174]. Some simulation and in vitro studies have reported the potential benefit of small molecules found in Ginkgo biloba, such as the flavonoid quercetin discussed later. For instance, extracts from Ginkgo biloba leaves were identified as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-23CL(pro) using large-scale screening [175]. Another Ginkgo biloba extract was reported to block TNFα-induced reactive oxygen species from human aortic endothelial cells [176]. The Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 was beneficial in generalized anxiety disorder [177] and dementia [178], actions that may be useful for the neuropsychiatric aspects of long-COVID. Ginkgolic acid (GA) was shown to inhibit the fusion and synthesis of viral proteins [179]. Other studies have shown that green tea catechins could be useful in COVID-19 [180, 181], especially against entry of SARS-CoV-2 [182]. The broccoli extract sulforaphane inhibited expression of IL-6 and IL-8 induced by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in bronchial epithelial cells [183].",
            "Certain natural flavonoids [184] have been proposed as prophylaxis or treatment against COVID-19 [185–189]. Such flavonoids are found in green plants and seeds and possess potent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective properties [184]. However, their consumption as part of the diet does not provide sufficient systemic levels. However, there are a number of sources of pharmaceutical-grade purity (>98%) using different biomasses such as Citrus limon, Cynara cardunculus (artichoke), oregano, and Saphora japonicum.",
            "In particular, a number of studies using in silico approaches identified the flavonol quercetin and the structurally related flavone luteolin as a potential strong blockers of RBD [190–192]. Luteolin and some of its methylated analogues have a number of beneficial actions with respect to long-COVID: broad antiviral properties [193–195], inhibition of coronavirus entry [127, 196, 197], and inhibition of the serine protease required for spike protein processing [198, 199]. Furthermore, luteolin inhibits activation of both microglia [200–203] and mast cells [204, 205] via inhibition of signaling pathways involving the inflammasome [206, 207] and mTOR (Fig. 2) in both mast cells [205] and microglia [203]. The novel luteolin structural analogue tetramethoxyluteolin (methoxyluteolin) is an even more potent inhibitor than luteolin [203–206].",
            "With respect to long-COVID especially, luteolin could prevent neuro-inflammation [208–211], is neuroprotective [208, 210, 212, 213], and reduces cognitive dysfunction [214–218], especially brain fog [58, 60, 62].",
            "Quercetin has been discussed in a few recent studies [219, 220], including an open-label clinical study showing good tolerability and benefit [221]. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study using a liposomal preparation of luteolin (PureLut) in long-COVID patients is underway. Combining quercetin with luteolin may provide additional benefits, especially when formulated in olive pomace oil (FibroProtek) that increases oral absorption, that is otherwise quite limited (<10%) [222]. Moreover, olive pomace oil provides additional antiviral [223] and anti-inflammatory [224]. Such liposomal preparations are available [222] and have been successfully used in pilot clinical trials [225] and reduced neuropsychiatric symptoms and associated serum IL-6 levels [226].",
            "Further studies are urgently needed to address the neuropathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [227, 228] or the long-term effects of COVID-19 especially in the brain [229]. COVID vaccines have been enormously helpful [230–232], but there have been reports of rare neurological complications including Guillain-Barre syndrome and Bell’s palsy [233]. These may be related to the recent finding that the spike protein expressed in response to mRNA vaccines was detected in the circulation as early as 1 day post vaccination and became undetectable by day 14 [234]. Hence, we should try to limit or prevent spike-related detrimental effects especially to the brain and their potential contribution to the development of long-COVID.",

            "Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with new-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). The overall goal of this study is to uncover how the COVID-19 severity gradient impacts the conventional pathological pathway of PD to inform the identification of at-risk patients and the development of personalized treatment strategies. Transcriptomics analysis of 43 PD pathogenic genes was conducted on nasopharyngeal swabs from 50 COVID-19 patients with varying severity including 17 outpatients, 16 non-ICU, and 17 ICU patients, compared to 13 SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals. The study shows that COVID-19 severity gradient differentially dysregulates PD pathological genes. Dysfunctional lysosomal and mitochondrial processes in outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients was identified as the convergent network of COVID-19—PD interactions. These dysfunctions were later abrogated by the upregulation of the ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome system in ICU COVID-19 patients. A potential synergistic co-expression and clustering of protein clearance pathway genes with other pathological genes was observed in ICU patients, indicating a possible overlap in biological pathways. Dysregulation of the PD pathopharmacogene, SLC6A3 was observed in ICU patients, suggesting potential COVID-19-gene-drug interactions. Nasopharyngeal swabs express major PD pathological genes as well as clinically relevant drug processing genes, which could advance studies on PD, including diagnosis, pathogenesis, and the development of disease-modifying treatments. Outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients may face a higher risk of developing new-onset PD, whereas ICU COVID-19 patients may be more susceptible to COVID-19-gene-drug interactions.",
            "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11481-025-10215-4.",
            "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with several central and peripheral nervous system symptoms including headache, stroke, ageusia, anosmia, myelitis, myalgia, encephalopathy, and neuropsychiatric manifestations (Farrokhi et al. 2023). This suggests potential interactions with the pathological pathway of neurological diseases (Farrokhi et al. 2023; Iravanpour et al. 2023). Indeed, studies have found a positive association between new-onset neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathological agent that causes COVID-19 (Rahmati et al. 2023a, b). Three different clinical case reports have documented new-onset parkinsonism in COVID-19 patients (Cohen et al. 2020; Faber et al. 2020; Méndez-Guerrero et al. 2020). These patients were less than 60 years old, had no history of PD or exposure to neurotoxicants, and developed PD symptoms less than 2 months after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. They also exhibited abnormalities in nigrostriatal dopamine transporter (DAT) activity; however, two of the patients responded positively to dopaminergic therapy (Cohen et al. 2020; Faber et al. 2020) but the oldest patient did not respond and had significant symptom improvement without any specific therapeutic intervention(Méndez-Guerrero et al. 2020). One out of the three patients underwent genetic testing for genetic polymorphisms linked to PD and the result was negative (Cohen et al. 2020). This suggests that COVID-19 probably triggered the pathological pathway associated with PD, highlighting the urgent need for preclinical and clinical studies to further validate COVID-19-mediated interactions with PD and its underlying mechanism.",
            "Similar to COVID-19, PD is a multisystem disorder impacting the central and peripheral nervous systems (Leta et al. 2021). The pathophysiological hallmark of PD is the misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein (AS) into Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites and the consequential death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) (Benítez-Burraco et al. 2016; Nwabufo and Aigbogun 2022; Iravanpour et al. 2023). PD is clinically characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms with the non-motor symptoms taking the lead in clinical manifestation(Nwabufo and Aigbogun 2022). It is noteworthy that hyposmia, a non-motor symptom of PD overlaps with COVID-19 symptomology and serves as an early indicator of PD during its initial stages(Rey et al. 2018). This is particularly significant as the olfactory system is a key site for the accumulation of AS (Rey et al. 2018). This suggests that the nasal cavity may be a primal target site for investigating COVID-19 – PD interactions for the early detection of at-risk patients.",
            "Previous studies have shown that AS is involved in the innate immune response following viral infection, uncovering a potential pathological network for COVID-19 – PD interactions (Tulisiak et al. 2019). Preclinical studies have started uncovering potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may interact with the pathological pathway associated with PD (Philippens et al. 2022; Käufer et al. 2022). For example, a preclinical study using male and female SARS-CoV-2-infected Syrian hamsters investigated how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts brain neuroinflammatory processes and accumulation of neurotoxic proteins including AS, tau, and hyper-phosphorylated tau either at the onset of clinical symptoms and high virus levels in the body (day 3) or after recovery from infection and no detectable virus (day 14) (Käufer et al. 2022). They discovered that viral proteins in the nasal cavity triggered significant microglia activation in the olfactory bulb even after viral clearance. Furthermore, they observed a significant increase in AS, tau, and hyper-phosphorylated tau in cortical neurons on day 14 post-infection (Käufer et al. 2022). These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with elevated expression and accumulation of AS which persist even after the virus is cleared and could potentially contribute to long-term neurological diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as PD (Iravanpour et al. 2023).",
            "To better understand the interplay between COVID-19 and PD, it is imperative to demonstrate how the COVID-19 severity gradient impacts the conventional pathological pathway of PD. This will help identify the stage of the disease that may be likely to interfere with the pathogenesis of PD and allow for individualized treatment of the affected patient population. Furthermore, the involvement of the nasal cavity in the early stage of PD and COVID-19 pathogenesis implies that the nasal specimen may be useful for investigating the interplay between COVID-19 and PD. The overall goal of this current study is to investigate how the COVID-19 severity gradient impacts the expression of genes associated with the pathogenesis of PD in nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from patients at different COVID-19 severity levels including outpatients, non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and ICU patients compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals. This study will help uncover the potential benefits of nasopharyngeal swab samples for PD diagnosis, pathogenesis, and testing of disease-modifying treatments. If this study uncovers the expression of PD pathogenic genes in nasopharyngeal swab samples, it may help identify the impact of COVID-19 on several PD pathological pathways including AS misfolding and aggregation, mitochondrial function, protein clearance pathways, neuroinflammation, and pharmacogenetics following COVID-19 severity gradient. The outcome of this study will help identify COVID-19 patient groups that are at-risk of COVID-19 – PD interactions, allowing for personalized treatment strategies, especially for patients with long COVID.",
            "The transcriptomics dataset used in this study is based on recently performed clinical studies and RNA-sequencing of nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients, and the datasets can be freely accessed here—https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Comparative_transcriptomic_analysis_of_nasopharyngeal_swabs_from_individuals_with_and_without_COVID-19/22704403/1. The associated methodology used in the study is described below.",
            "The clinical study was carried out as previously described (Kotwa et al. 2022; Nwabufo et al. 2024). Population-based infectious disease surveillance is carried out in metropolitan Toronto and Peel, Ontario, Canada (population: 4.2 million in 2021) by the Toronto Invasive Bacterial Diseases Network (TIBDN). Four hospitals (North York—General Division, Scarborough Hospital—General Division, Sunnybrook—Sunnybrook Campus, and Toronto East General Hospital/Michael Garron Hospital) report clinical specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 to TIBDN's central study office. Those who underwent ambulatory treatment, ICU admission, or non-ICU hospitalization in the collaborating hospitals between October 2020 and October 2021 and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by clinical qPCR testing were eligible for the study. People who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 were used as controls in the study. All the four participating TIBDN hospitals approved the research (REB# 2024–0233-1025, MED-02–011, SUN-5024, and 084–0209-Lab-001), and all patients provided informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.",
            "As previously described (Kotwa et al. 2022; Nwabufo et al. 2024), data on COVID-19 risk factors, medical conditions, and demographics were collected through participant interviews and chart reviews. Following established practice (Marty et al. 2020), the study staff collected nasopharyngeal swabs from the participants during enrollment at their respective study centers. For further investigation, nasopharyngeal swabs were quickly put into a universal transport medium (Copan Diagnostics, Murrietta, CA).",
            "On the day of collection, samples were processed at Sunnybrook Research Institute. Nasopharyngeal swabs were aliquoted and kept at −80 °C after undergoing a 20-second vortexing step (Kotwa et al. 2022; Nwabufo et al. 2024). As directed by the manufacturer, 40 µL of nasopharyngeal swab was used for RNA extraction using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit from QIAGEN (https://www.qiagen.com; Kotwa et al. 2022; Nwabufo et al. 2024).",
            "As previously described (Kotwa et al. 2023; Nwabufo et al. 2024), RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was carried out at the University of Toronto's Donnelly Sequencing Centre (http://ccbr.utoronto.ca/donnelly-sequencing-centre). Qubit RNA HS (cat # Q32852, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA) fluorescent chemistry was used to quantify DNase-treated total RNA, and the High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape (cat # 5067–5579, Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, USA) was utilized to calculate the RNA integrity number (RIN) from 5 ng of RNA. The median RIN score was 3, and the lowest RIN recorded was 1.5. The NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit v2 (Human/Mouse/Rat) (NEB Cat# E7405) was used in conjunction with the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB Cat# E7765) to build RNA-seq libraries from RNA samples (50 ng). Libraries depleted of ribosomal RNA showed a mean concentration of 15.2 ng/µL. An Agilent Bioanalyzer dsDNA High Sensitivity chip (cat # 5067–4626, Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, USA) was used to analyze a 1 µL top stock of each purified final library. After size adjustment, equimolar pooling was carried out following library quantification using the Quant-iT dsDNA high-sensitivity kit (cat # Q33120, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA). The final pool was evaluated using an Agilent Bioanalyzer dsDNA High Sensitivity chip, and the NEBNext Library Quant Kit for Illumina (cat # E7630L, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA) was used for quantification. Utilizing an S2 flowcell, the hybridized pool was subjected to paired-end sequencing of 150 bp at a final concentration of 320 pM on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. The sequencing depth was optimized to achieve 65 M per sample and 350 pM loading.",
            "Nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with varying levels of disease severity and SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals were subjected to RNA-seq analysis as previously described (Nwabufo et al. 2024). Seven comparative analyses of genes associated with PD pathological pathways including AS misfolding and aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysfunctional protein clearance pathways, inflammation, and pharmacogenetics (Kouli et al. 2018; Franco-Iborra et al. 2018; Day and Mullin 2021; Nwabufo and Aigbogun 2022; Coukos and Krainc 2024; Flønes et al. 2024) (Table 1) were performed using DESeq2 (Love et al. 2014) as follows: all COVID-19 patients versus negatives, outpatients versus negatives, non-ICU patients versus negatives, ICU patients versus negatives, outpatients versus non-ICU patients, outpatients versus ICU patients, and ICU patients versus non-ICU patients. The paired end fastq files used for sequencing data were evaluated for quality using FASTQC, which can be accessed at https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/. Fastp v0.21.0 was used for quality filtering with the default parameters (Chen et al. 2018). Salmon v.1.4.0 (Patro et al. 2017)was used to quantify transcripts, and the following parameters were used: –validateMappings, –seqBias, and –gcBias. Salmon's reference index was the human transcriptome from GENCODE v37 (Frankish et al. 2021). Using the txtimport package v.1.22.0, transcript counts (.quant files) were imported into R v4.1.2. The ‘regularized log’ (rlog) transformation was used to calculate the normalized transcript expression levels for all genes. The result was a data matrix that could be used for additional statistical analysis. DESeq2v.1.34.0 was then used to identify differentially expressed genes with an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 to account for multiple comparisons in the statistical analysis. With GraphPad Prism® (version 8.0 for Microsoft Windows, Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA, United States), a box plot of differentially expressed genes was generated. SRplot (https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/srplot) was used to create heatmaps and volcano plots.\nTable 1Panel of Parkinson’s disease pathogenic genes investigated in nasopharyngeal swab samples of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 individualsGene Symbol for α-synuclein PathologyGene Symbol for Mitochondrial DysfunctionGene Symbol for Dysfunctional Protein Clearance SystemsGene Symbol for InflammationGene Symbol for Relevant PharmacogenesSNCAPRKNATP13A2BST1DRD1SNCBPINK1UCHL1HLA-DRB5DRD2SNCGPARK7VPS35TSPODRD3EIF4G1HTRA2DNAJC6IL2DRD4LRRK2FBXO7SYNJ1CCL5SLC6A3GIGYF2TOMM20DNAJC13——COMTMAPTTIMM23VPS13C————PLA2G6TIMM21GBA————GCH1——MAP1LC3B2————GAK——LAMP1————SYT11——LAMP2————————LAMP3————————LAMP5————",

            "Three samples were ultimately eliminated from the study owing to sample-related problems, out of the 66 participants who were initially enrolled. The remaining 63 participants include 13 SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals and 50 COVID-19 patients comprising 17 outpatients, 16 non-ICU patients, and 17 ICU patients. A comprehensive patient clinical and demographic characteristics have been recently documented (Nwabufo et al. 2024) and detailed in Table 2. In general, age decreased from ICU patients to negative individuals with ICU patients being older and negative individuals being younger (Nwabufo et al. 2024). There were no significant differences in the number of male and female participants across the study groups (Nwabufo et al. 2024). Comorbidities, COVID-19-related complications, and medication usage were more frequent among ICU patients, followed by non-ICU hospitalized patients (Nwabufo et al. 2024). Based on the available medical information, none of the patients had Parkinson’s. One of the non-ICU COVID-19 patients had neuromuscular illness, specifically hemiplegia, paraplegia/quadriplegia, and seizure disorder, as well as depression. Two COVID-19 patients in the ICU experienced neuropsychiatric issues: one exhibited a neuropsychiatric syndrome along with delirium, while the other solely had delirium.\nTable 2Patient clinicopathological and demographic ProfilesCharacteristicsNegative, A(n = 13)Outpatient, B(n = 17)Non-ICU, C(n = 16)ICU, D(n = 17)Significant DifferencesAge (years), median (IQR)30 (44)47 (25)58 (24)65 (14)A-C**; A-D***; B-D**Height (cm), median (IQR)NANA170 (21)169 (17)NSDWeight (kg), median (IQR)NANA88 (34)83 (31)NSDSymptom onset to specimen collection (days), median (IQR)NA2 (3)5 (5)4 (4)NSDSexMale, n (%)4 (31)7 (41)7 (44)9 (53)NSDFemale, n (%)8 (62)10 (59)9 (56)8 (47)NSDCOVID-19 Vaccination StatusVaccinated, n (%)8 (62)11 (65)7 (44)1 (6)NSDNot vaccinated, n (%)5 (38)2 (12)9 (56)5 (29)NSDComplicationsAcute respiratory distress syndrome, n (%)NANANA4 (24)NSDPneumonia, n (%)NANA13 (81)15 (88)NSDRespiratory failure, n (%)NANANA8 (47)NSDComorbiditiesCancer condition, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDCardiac illnesses, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDDiabetes, n (%)NANANA5 (29)NSDGastro-intestinal illnesses, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDNeuromuscular illnesses, n (%)NANA1 (6)NANSDPulmonary illnesses, n (%)NANA2 (13)4 (24)NSDRheumatologic illnesses, n (%)NANA1 (6)NANSDVascular illnesses, n (%)NANA5 (31)10 (59)NSDMedicationsAmoxicillin + Clavulanic Acid, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDAspirin, n (%)NANA2 (13)2 (12)NSDAzithromycin, n (%)NANANA5 (29)NSDCandesartan, n (%)NANA2 (13)2 (12)NSDCapecitabine, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDCefazolin, n (%)NANANA3 (18)NSDCeftazidime, n (%)NANANA3 (18)NSDCeftriaxone, n (%)NANA4 (25)13 (76)NSDCelecoxib, n (%)NANA2 (13)1 (6)NSDCiprofloxacin, n (%)NANANA3 (18)NSDClarithromycin, n (%)NANA1 (6)NANSDConvalescent COVID-19 plasma, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDDexamethasone, n (%)NANA14 (88)17 (100)NSDEnoxaparin, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDErtapenem, n (%)NANANA3 (18)NSDFluticasone/salmeterol, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDGentamycin, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDHydroxychloroquine sulphate, n (%)NANA1 (6)NANSDIsoflurane, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDLevofloxacin, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDMeropenem, n (%)NANANA5 (29)NSDMethylprednisolone, n (%)NANANA2 (12)NSDMoxifloxacin, n (%)NANA1 (6)NANSDPiperacillin + Tazobactam, n (%)NANANA11 (65)NSDPrednisolone, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDRamipril, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDRemdesivir, n (%)NANA9 (56)5 (29)NSDTelmisartan, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDTobramycin, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDTocilizumab, n (%)NANA6 (38)5 (29)NSDVancomycin, n (%)NANANA6 (35)NSDPatients with polypharmacy, n (%)NANA2 (13)6 (35)NSDAverage polypharmacy use, median (IQR)NANA5 (0)10 (12)NSDRaceArab, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDChinese, n (%)NANA2 (13)1 (6)NSDFilipino, n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDSouth Asian (East Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, etc.), n (%)NANA1 (6)2 (12)NSDSoutheast Asian (Vietnamese, Cambodian, Malaysian, Laotian), n (%)NANANA1 (6)NSDWest Asian (Iranian, Afghan, etc.), n (%)NANA3 (19)2 (12)NSDWhite/Caucasian, n (%)NANA3 (19)6 (35)NSDStatistical significance was assessed utilizing Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test. **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001.

All the other investigated genes (COMT, DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4) associated with pharmacogenetic liabilities in PD were not significantly dysregulated (Supplementary Figures S4 and S5).",
            "To identify the primary PD pathological pathways linked to varying COVID-19 severity levels, genes with statistical significance and notable fold changes in expression were examined across seven comparisons of different COVID-19 patient groups (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figure S6). Then, heatmap was used to evaluate inter- and intra-patient group differences in the expression pattern of individual genes, as well as potential associations among the investigated genes (Fig. 5). Lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction appears to be the predominant PD pathological pathway in outpatients and non-ICU patients compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals (Fig. 4). This is demonstrated by the profound statistical downregulation of genes associated with mitochondrial and lysosomal function including TOMM20, TIMM21, and VPS35 with outpatients taking the lead (Fig. 4). Interestingly, these three genes are closely clustered together with negative individuals having the highest expression followed by ICU patients while outpatients and non-ICU patients had the lowest expression with outpatients leading the pack (Fig. 5). The lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction pathway initially triggered in the outpatient and non-ICU patient groups was abolished in the ICU patient group (Fig. 4). This abolishment appears to have been accomplished by the activation of the protein clearance pathways, specifically, the ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome system (Fig. 4). This is demonstrated by the upregulation of UCHL1 and MAP1LC3B2 genes in ICU patients compared to the negative individuals (Fig. 4). Other genes including GAK, SYNJ1, BST1, LRRK2, SLC6A3, and SNCG were also upregulated in ICU patients (Fig. 4). Intriguingly, LRRK2, BST1, SLC6A3, MAP1LC3B2, SYNJ1, and GAK are closely clustered together and there appears to be some level of uniform expression pattern for these genes across the patient groups (Fig. 5). Similarly, SNCG and UCHL1 are more closely clustered together and also have some level of uniform expression pattern (Fig. 5). When compared to outpatients, ICU patients demonstrate restored mitochondrial and lysosomal functions through the upregulation of HTRA2, TIMM21, VPS35, TOMM20, and LAMP1 (Fig. 4). However, SLC6A3 was also upregulated and was clustered with genes that appeared to be linked with protein clearance pathways (Figs. 4 and 5). The following genes were clustered together and appeared to have some level of expression pattern across the different patient groups: HTRA2 and LAMP1; TOMM20, TIMM21, and VPS35 (Fig. 5). No significant dysregulation was observed for the following comparisons: all COVID-19 positives vs negatives, outpatients vs non-ICUs, and non-ICUs vs ICUs (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figure S6).Fig. 4Volcano plot representing differential gene expression for the investigated Parkinson’s disease-associated pathogenic genes in nasopharyngeal swabs of non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 individuals.

            "Heatmap illustrating differentially expressed Parkinson’s disease pathogenic genes in nasopharyngeal swabs of non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 individuals. The normalized gene expression levels of the investigated Parkinson’s disease-associated pathogenic genes were determined by RNA-seq analyses of nasopharyngeal swabs from 50 COVID-19 patients (17 outpatients, 16 non-ICU patients, and 17 ICU patients), along with a comparison to 13 SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals. Individual study participants are represented by the columns, and each row corresponds to a gene. The color intensity reflects the normalized expression level, with warmer colors (red) denoting upregulated expression and cooler colors (blue) denoting downregulated expression. There is also a color scale bar with red standing for high expression levels, white for intermediate expression, and blue for low expression levels. This demonstrates the unique gene expression patterns found in the various study groups",
            "In this study, COVID-19-mediated interactions with 43 PD pathogenic genes in nasopharyngeal swab samples from patients with varying disease severity levels were examined. The clinical cohort included 17 outpatients, 16 non-ICU patients, 17 ICU patients, and 13 SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals from the Greater Toronto Area. Given that the nasal cavity is the primal target site for the early stages of both PD and SARS-CoV-2 infection, it was necessary to see whether nasopharyngeal swab expresses clinically relevant pathogenic genes associated with PD to inform its potential utility for early PD diagnosis, disease mechanism studies, investigation of COVID-19 mediated interactions with PD, and testing of potential disease-modifying therapies.",
            "To the best of current knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the expression of genes associated with the pathological pathway of PD in nasopharyngeal swab samples, as well as the interplay between COVID-19 disease severity levels as demonstrated by hospitalization status and the expression of PD pathogenic genes. This study has uncovered for the first time the expression of major genes linked to PD pathological pathways in nasopharyngeal swab samples. Recently, the nasopharyngeal expression of major drug metabolizing enzymes and membrane transporters involved in processing commonly prescribed drugs, as well as those recommended by the United States Food and Drug Administration for routine assessment of investigational new drugs, was demonstrated by our group (Nwabufo et al. 2024). Of interest is the nasopharyngeal expression of two important membrane efflux transporters, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) which often play a synergistic role in restricting the penetration of neurotherapeutic agents across the blood–brain barrier (Hou et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2014; Nwabufo 2022; Nwabufo and Aigbogun 2022; Nwabufo et al. 2024). Beyond impacting the disposition of neurotherapeutic agents, P-gp and BCRP are also implicated in the neuropathology of PD (Bartels et al. 2008; Zlokovic 2008), and our group recently showed that P-gp is downregulated in the nasopharyngeal swab of COVID-19 patients (Nwabufo et al. 2024). Moreover, PD pathology initially manifests in the olfactory nucleus and brainstem, progressing in sequential stages to affect the substantia nigra before spreading to other regions of the brain (Braak et al. 2003). Altogether, this indicates that nasopharyngeal swab samples may be used for studying PD pathology, early diagnosis, and evaluation of neurotherapeutic agents, potentially addressing the longstanding issue of inadequate models for studying PD (Nwabufo and Aigbogun 2022). Nonetheless, further studies are required to validate the correlation between PD pathology in nasopharyngeal swabs compared to the central nervous system.",
            "From a pathological standpoint, there appears to be a convergent network of interactions amongst multiple pathways including neuroinflammation, AS misfolding and aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and dysfunctional protein clearance processes in PD (Coukos and Krainc 2024). In PD, mutations and environmental factors trigger AS aggregation, disrupting cellular processes like protein trafficking and lysosomal function (Outeiro and Lindquist 2003; Cooper et al. 2006; Xilouri et al. 2009; Mazzulli et al. 2011; Bellucci et al. 2011), making AS a putative target for the development of disease-modifying treatments (Kakish et al. 2016; Nwabufo et al. 2019, 2021; Aigbogun et al. 2022). Dysfunctional lysosomes and mitochondria impair the removal of damaged organelles and cytosolic components, leading to AS accumulation in Lewy bodies (Chen et al. 2015; Shahmoradian et al. 2019). In this current study, it is evident that dysfunctional lysosomes and mitochondria are the major convergent pathways implicated in COVID-19-mediated interactions with PD pathological pathways in both outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients, with the effect being more statistically pronounced in outpatients (Fig. 4). On the contrary, the dysfunctional lysosomes and mitochondria observed in both outpatients and non-ICU patients appear to be abrogated by the upregulation of ubiquitin–proteasome and autophagy-lysosome protein clearance pathways (Fig. 4).",
            "Mitochondrial dysfunction is characterized by altered intrinsic homeostasis which plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of PD (Franco-Iborra et al. 2018). The mitochondrial function relies on importing nuclear-encoded proteins through two key complexes: the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM20) complex and the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM23) complex (Shiota et al. 2015; Wiedemann and Pfanner 2017). TIM21, a component of the TIM23 complex, bridges TOM20 and TIM23 by binding to TOM22 in the intermembrane space (Albrecht et al. 2006). Previous in vitro and in vivo studies showed that complex I inhibition impaired mitochondrial protein import by downregulating TOM20 and TIM23 protein expression, with the consequential in vitro accumulation of aggregated proteins inside mitochondria and the downregulation of mitochondrial chaperones (Franco-Iborra et al. 2018). However, in vitro overexpression of TOM20 or TIM23 abolished most of the pathological changes such as mitochondrial dysfunction and dopaminergic cell death (Franco-Iborra et al. 2018). Similarly, an ex-vivo study confirmed the decreased expression of TIM23 and TOM20 protein levels in substantia nigra protein homogenates from PD patients compared to age-matched controls (Franco-Iborra et al. 2018). Interestingly, downregulation of TOMM20 and TIMM21 was observed in both outpatients and non-ICU patients in a synergistic manner although TOMM20 downregulation was more pronounced in non-ICU patients compared to TIMM21 (Figs. 1 and 4). However, the compromised TOMM20 -TIMM21 import machinery appears to be fairly rescued in the ICU patients, in a manner consistent with the strong upregulation of the mitochondrial protease chaperone, HTRA2 in ICU patients (Figs. 1 and 4). In corroboration with the findings of this present study, a recent study found that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to reduced expression of nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial-encoded mitochondrial genes, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction (Guarnieri et al. 2023). This was observed in nasopharyngeal samples and autopsy tissues from COVID-19 patients, as well as in tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters and mice (Guarnieri et al. 2023).",
            "VPS35 was downregulated in both outpatients and non-ICU patients (Figs. 2 and 4) indicating dysfunctional protein clearance pathways, particularly, the autophagy-lysosome pathway. VPS35, a component of the retromer complex, plays a key role in endosomal protein sorting and trafficking, an essential component of the lysosomal protein clearance pathway (Zavodszky et al. 2014; McGough et al. 2014). Complete deletion of VPS35 results in abnormalities in lysosomal structure, function, and protein composition due to the buildup of incorrectly sorted proteins from the endomembrane system (Daly et al. 2023). Furthermore, the D620N mutation in VPS35 causes late on-set PD (Vilariño-Güell et al. 2011; Zimprich et al. 2011). A recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2's ORF3a protein regulates and alters late endosomes, and lysosomal positioning and function (Walia et al. 2024).",
            "On the contrary, the protein clearance pathway was restored in ICU patients with the upregulation of UCHL1, a marker of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway (Figs. 2 and 4). Dysregulation of UCHL1 is implicated in the pathophysiology of PD. The mRNA and protein expression levels of UCHL1 were reduced in the brains of idiopathic PD patients (Choi et al. 2004; Barrachina et al. 2006). UCHL1 knockout mice exhibited complete degeneration of presynaptic terminals at neuromuscular junctions, compromised synaptic transmission, as well as gradual paralysis, and premature mortality (Chen et al. 2010). Furthermore, increased MAP1LC3B2 (which encodes LC3-II) expression levels in ICU patients (Figs. 2 and 4) reflect an increase in the number of autophagosomes, supporting the activation of the autophagy-lysosome system (Barth et al. 2010).",
            "Intriguingly, SNCA and SNCB expression were not significantly affected across the COVID-19 patient groups compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals (Supplementary Figure S1). However, SNCG expression was upregulated in both non-ICU and ICU patients with ICU patients taking the lead (Figs. 1 and 4). Compared to SNCA and SNCB, SNCG has the highest relative expression in the substantia nigra across brain regions despite having limited pathological involvement with PD (Brás et al. 2021). Pathological accumulation of SNCG has been found in the brains of PD patients but not in the brains of controls and other neurodegenerative disorder patient groups (Galvin et al. 1999). Furthermore, overexpression of mouse SNCG resulted in SNCG aggregation, neuronal loss, motor deficits, and premature death, consistent with the pathophysiology and symptomology of PD (Ninkina et al. 2009; Peters et al. 2012). Although the physiological function of SNCG is unknown (Patel and Bordoni 2024), the findings from this study suggest a potential role in driving protein clearance pathways, particularly the ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome system. This speculation arises from observations of its co-expression pattern with genes associated with protein clearance in ICU patients (Figs. 4 and 5). The same applies to GAK, SYNJ1, BST1, LRRK2, and SLC6A3 (Figs. 4 and 5). In PD, robust connections have been established through numerous GWAS and subsequent post-GWAS analyses for genes such as SNCA, RAB29, MAPT, BST1, GAK, LRRK2, and HLA-DRB5, among others (Escott‐Price et al. 2015; Nalls et al. 2019). GAK, for instance, plays a role in synaptic endocytosis, bridging this pathway in sporadic PD to the rare forms associated with DNAJC6 and SYNJ1 monogenic PD (Day and Mullin 2021). It is fascinating how certain genes have both common variants linked to higher sporadic disease risk and rare variants causing monogenic PD, hinting at shared biological pathways (Day and Mullin 2021; Coukos and Krainc 2024).",
            "Evidently, the dysregulation of PD pathogenic genes by COVID-19 coupled with validated conventional genetic abnormalities associated with PD pathogenesis highlights the importance of personalized treatment for PD patients with COVID-19 comorbidities, as well as COVID-19 patients at risk of new-onset PD. Various genetic variations linked to dopamine action and metabolism impact medication responses and side effects in PD (Day and Mullin 2021). These variations involve genes such as dopamine receptors (DRD), dopamine transporter (SLC6A3), and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) (Contin et al. 2005; Corvol et al. 2011; Kraemmer et al. 2016). Interestingly, SLC6A3 was upregulated in ICU patients (Figs. 3, 4, and 5), suggesting potential COVID-19-gene-drug interactions for ICU patients with PD comorbidity characterized by SLC6A3 pharmacogenetic liability. Our group have provided guidance on how to address disease-mediated interactions with drugs (Nwabufo and Bendayan 2022; Nwabufo et al. 2023; Nwabufo 2023) and recommend that healthcare team members consider this at the point of care when treating COVID-19 patients with PD comorbidity or new on-set PD.",
            "The interpretation of the outcome of this study should be considered alongside its limitations. The sample size is relatively small, and full clinical information on all the subjects were not available. Although the available clinical information for these patients indicates that none of them have PD, other comorbidities these patients may have, as well as any potential underlying PD genetic liabilities and ongoing medications may impact the expression of the investigated genes. However, the absence of abnormal expression patterns in the investigated genes, as depicted in the heatmap (Fig. 5), suggests that dysregulation patterns for these genes are not solely driven by the expression level of a single patient. Nonetheless, future studies should investigate the potential role of age, sex, and comorbidities in driving the interaction between COVID-19 and PD. As shown in Table 2, ICU patients exhibited a higher burden of comorbidities and were receiving multiple medications, both of which may influence gene expression patterns. Therefore, future studies should further investigate the potential impact of ongoing medication on the observed gene expression changes in this patient population.",
            "This study shows that COVID-19 mediates interactions with PD pathological genes differentially for patients with varying levels of disease severity. The study showed that the convergent network of COVID-19-PD interactions was dysfunctional lysosomal and mitochondrial processes in outpatients and non-ICU COVID-19 patients. These dysfunctions were later abrogated by the upregulation of the protein clearance pathways, particularly, the ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome system in ICU COVID-19 patients. A potential synergistic co-expression and clustering of protein clearance pathway genes with other pathological genes, specifically, GAK, SYNJ1, BST1, LRRK2, SLC6A3, and SNCG was observed in ICU COVID-19 patients, suggesting a potential overlap in biological pathways. Given the underlying genetic liabilities, as well as COVID-19-mediated dysregulation of some PD pathological genes such as SLC6A3, personalized treatment strategies for COVID-19 patients with PD comorbidities or new on-set PD is recommended to mitigate potential adverse drug effects or limited drug response that may be caused by COVID-19-gene-drug interactions. The outcome of this study have shown that nasopharyngeal swabs express major PD pathological genes as well as clinically relevant drug processing genes including drug metabolizing enzymes and membrane transporters, making it a potential specimen for investigating PD diagnosis, understanding its pathogenesis, and assessing the effectiveness of potential treatments aimed at modifying the course of the disease. Further research with a large sample size and age/sex-matched patient groups will help validate the identified interactions between COVID-19 and PD pathological pathways and clarify the cellular network in the nasopharyngeal swab responsible for the observed expression of PD-related pathogenic genes. Given that PD is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder and COVID-19 is a relatively acute illness, a longitudinal study is essential to determine whether the observed changes from this present study may contribute to the eventual development of new-onset PD.",

            "During the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is universally susceptible to all types of populations. In addition to the elderly and children becoming the groups of great concern, pregnant women carrying new lives need to be even more alert to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies have shown that pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to brain damage and post-birth psychiatric disorders in offspring. It has been widely recognized that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the development of the fetal nervous system directly or indirectly. Pregnant women are recommended to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on the fetus through vaccination, nutritional supplements, and psychological support. This review summarizes the possible mechanisms of the nervous system effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on their offspring during the pregnancy and analyzes the available prophylactic and treatment strategies to improve the prognosis of fetal-related neuropsychiatric diseases after birth.",
            "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic in March 2020. It has since been called “the most critical global health disaster of the century and the greatest challenge facing humanity since World War II” [1, 2]. COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the globe, posing enormous health, economic and social challenges to humanity. As a respiratory infectious disease, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted mainly through droplets, respiratory secretions, and direct contact [3]. However, recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can also affect the health of the next generation through vertical transmission from mother to child [4, 5]. Although COVID-19 is considered as a respiratory disease with the main clinical manifestations of fever, cough, and malaise, SARS-CoV-2 still causes damage to other organs, including the central nervous system (CNS) with symptoms such as dizziness, headache, and impaired consciousness [6]. Current human autopsy studies have determined that patients who died from COVID-19 had detectable viral RNA transcription products in brain tissue, viral proteins in endothelial cells of the olfactory bulb, and genetic sequencing of the cerebrospinal fluid showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to invade the nervous system [7–9]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide has been steadily increasing, and we have to consider whether maternal infection may have adverse effects on their offspring. The fetal nervous system is in a state of development from the third week of gestation and this process continues until adulthood [10]. During this period, any deviation can lead to nervous system developmental defects and cognitive impairment [11]. Considering the risk of maternal infection on neuropsychiatric disorders in the offspring, this review summarizes the mechanisms of nervous system effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women on their offspring and analyzes feasible treatment modalities.",
            "Since the COVID-19 epidemic, several studies have reported that the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of patients with combined SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy are consistent with those of the general population, with patients showing increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and decreased lymphocytes in their hemogram [12]. Tanacan et al. found that pregnant women with COVID-19 had significantly increased pregnancy complications and inflammatory markers [13]. In addition, the inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-6 were significantly increased, while IL-10 and IL-17 were decreased [13]. Since the fetus is a semi-allograft to the maternal body, pregnancy is also a specific immune adaptation process [14]. On the one hand, increased production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10 provides a suitable microenvironment of immunologic tolerance. On the other hand, altered expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α is associated with increased pregnancy complications, such as miscarriage, and preterm delivery [15, 16]. Thus, homeostasis of inflammatory cytokines is essential to a healthy pregnancy, while elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines suggest a state of MIA.",
            "Maternal trophoblasts, specific natural killer cells, and meconium leukocytes secrete IFN-γ during the pregnancy and are involved in the differentiation of meconium natural killer cells, placenta formation, and meconium maintenance [17]. However, congenital infection causes miscarriage and reduced IFN-γ levels. IFN-γ levels have been reported to be lower in patients with severe COVID-19 infection than in healthy pregnant women and in patients with mild to moderate infection [18]. Similarly, a significant increase in IL-6 levels is observed in patients with severe COVID-19 [19]. Excessive production of IL-6 is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and chorioamnionitis [20]. On the contrary, IL-10 is involved in the immune tolerance process during the pregnancy due to its anti-inflammatory effects and is mainly produced by placental chorionic trophoblasts, uterine natural killer cells, and metaphase mononuclear cells [21]. The decreased IL-10 levels in pregnant women with COVID-19 may be a factor in the impaired immune tolerance in this population and is associated with miscarriage [22]. Adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and chorioamnionitis can cause neonatal brain damage and even lifelong nervous system disorders [23]. In addition, increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, IL-1β, and CRP, were found to be associated with microcephaly, ventricular enlargement, and low intelligent quotient [24], suggesting that inflammatory cytokines can cross the placenta and blood-brain barrier (BBB) and directly affect fetal neurodevelopment.",
            "There is a study that reported that pregnant women during the influenza pandemics had a high incidence of psychiatric disorders in their offspring, including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [25]. Similar results have been obtained in animal experiments, where an animal model of maternal immune activation was constructed by administering polyinosinic- polycytidylic acid [Poly (I:C)] to pregnant mice, and it was found that exposure of mice on days 10–12 of embryonic life resulted in damage to the developing basal ganglia and offspring with defects in prepulse inhibition and latent inhibition that are similar to those found in ASD and schizophrenia individuals [26]. A study of Chinese mothers during the COVID-19 epidemic showed that most mothers were infected with SARS-CoV-2 around the third trimester, and their offspring had reduced motor, communication, and social performance compared to normal levels at 3 months of age [27]. The occurrence of infection in mothers during the first trimester may be a risk factor for ASD and schizophrenia in their offspring [28]. Given that IL-6 has the potential to alter cognitive behavior in offspring [29] and that elevated levels of IL-8, TNF-α, and CRP are associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia in offspring [30, 31], the effects of immune activation responses induced by maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on fetal brain development may make the offspring more susceptible to neuropsychiatric disorders.",
            "Past epidemiological studies have shown that a large number of viral infections during maternal pregnancy can lead to abnormalities in the nervous system in the fetus [32]. Although studies show that the probability of mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19 is extremely low, the possibility of vertical transmission has been reported in several cases [5, 33]. In a study from Wuhan, China, a primigravida was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at 34 weeks of gestation and delivered a baby by cesarean section in a negative pressure isolation room at 38 weeks of gestation, during which she wore an N95 mask without contact with the newborn [4]. However, the levels of IgM and IgG antibodies were significantly elevated 2 h after birth, suggesting the possibility of intrauterine infection. It is known that IgM antibodies cannot pass through the placenta, while IgG antibodies can be transmitted through the placenta, and IgM antibodies usually appear 3–7 days after infection, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may cause indirect infection of the fetus through vertical transmission from mother to child.",
            "During fetal brain development, genetic defects, environmental disturbances or pathogens can lead to defective mitosis or apoptosis of neural stem cells, which can disrupt the stem cell homeostasis and affect the differentiation of stem cells to other neural cells, manifesting as neurodevelopmental disorders, such as microcephaly and multiple sclerosis [34]. And the formation of neural circuits and changes in their function can lead to other mental disorders, such as ASD and schizophrenia [31]. It was found that SARS-CoV-2 may invade the CNS through blood circulation and peripheral nerve via the olfactory nerve [35].",
            "The immune system plays an important role in nervous system injury caused by viral infection [36]. Persistent infection with SARS-CoV-2 and its infection of macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes in the CNS activates the inflammatory response of the body, causing immune system damage and brain injury [37]. At the same time, immune system damage and peripheral lymphocytopenia caused by SARS-CoV-2 increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections and exacerbate neurological damage [38]. A large number of deaths caused by COVID-19, most of which are due to multiple organ failures caused by viral-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or SIRS-like immune disorders [39].",
            "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a cardiovascular and cerebrovascular protective factor, is also abundantly expressed in glial cells, and SARS-CoV-2 has a high affinity for ACE2, and its spine protein interacts with ACE2 to disrupt the BBB and attack the nervous system. Children complete myelin development by the age of 2 years, and SARS-CoV-2 infection of oligodendrocytes causes demyelinating lesions, such as multiple sclerosis [40]. Patients with COVID-19 often present with severe hypoxia, and that hypoxia injury in the fetus can cause secondary damage to the nervous system [41].",
            "The form of COVID-19 remains severe and people are inevitably affected and prone to stress and anxiety, and depression [42]. A meta-analysis study enrolling 27475 subjects showed ~25% of anxiety and 28% of depression in patients with COVID-19 [43]. Another cross-national study during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that 43% of the 6894 pregnant women and mothers felt elevated stress, 31% felt anxious or depressed, and 53% felt lonely [44]. It is suggested that pregnant women, as a more vulnerable group, are more emotionally vulnerable during their pregnancy and suffer from higher levels of psychological stress. In turn, excessive maternal stress during pregnancy produces prenatal stress damage that increases the risk of fetal neurodevelopmental disorders [45]. Animal studies have shown that prenatal stress leads to shorter and less complex dendrites, reduced myelin, and altered synapses [46]. To determine whether changes in brain function occur in the offspring of women with high maternal stress, Thomason et al. performed functional magnetic resonance imaging on 118 fetuses at a mean gestational age of 32.9 weeks and found that increased maternal prenatal stress and negative emotions were associated with alterations in fetal frontoparietal, striatal, and temporoparietal neural connectivity (β = 0.82, P < 0.001), suggesting that high maternal stress and negative emotions during the pregnancy can have an unwanted impact on the nervous system of the offspring [47].",
            "Deoni et al. found that children born after the COVID-19 pandemic were found to have lower developmental scores and these children had significantly lower language, motor, and overall cognitive skills [48]. Anti-epidemic measures may block parent-child emotional interactions and negatively affect children’s brains and behavior [49]. What’s more, this may be related to maternal stress and negative emotions during pregnancy affecting the structure and connectivity of the developing brain of the fetus, leading to potential delays in its motor, cognitive, and behavioral development [50]. The fetal brain is born with a strong capacity to learn and adapt, but is also very fragile and vulnerable to environmental exposures [51]. Maternal-fetal interaction and “kangaroo” care facilitate neurodevelopmental processes, including myelin formation and synaptogenesis [52]. On the other hand, exposure of the fetus to stress-related hormones such as cortisol might affect the structural and functional changes of the brain [53]. This is likely that higher cortisol levels in the mother during the pregnancy lead to lower cortisol levels in the infant at birth, which can dysregulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and affect neurological development in the newborn [54] (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Potential mechanisms of SARS-Cov-2 infection on the nervous system in the offspring during the pregnancy.

            "There is still no specific medicine for COVID-19, and the most common treatments for infection in pregnant women are antibiotics, antivirals, and oxygen support. However, both the public and the scientific community pay great attention to the safety and impacts of these treatment measures on the fetus. A meta-study analysis showed that the use of antibiotics and antivirals is higher in Asian countries than in other countries, suggesting a possibility of antibiotic abuse [55]. The use of immunosuppressive drugs is associated with the occurrence of adverse outcomes and potentially serious complications, and their use should be minimized, and improved therapeutic approaches through risk stratification are recommended. Therefore, effective prophylactic is important for disease management in pregnant women. Given that current studies have not reported serious adverse reactions in pregnant women after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine [56], a vaccine with nutritional support seems to be an effective approach. For pregnant women who have already developed psychological problems, appropriate use of drug medication and psychological treatment are recommended and prescribed under the guidance of physicians (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Prophylactic and treatment strategies. Effective prophylactic and treatment strategies for potential risks of offspring’s neuropsychiatric disorders in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "Vaccination against infectious pathogens is one of the most influential public health interventions to reduce infection-related morbidity and mortality worldwide [57]. Theoretically, anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins (IgG and IgA) are transmitted to the newborn through the placenta and breast milk after vaccination of pregnant women, providing humoral immunity. Regarding the safety of the vaccine in pregnant women, several studies have shown that no serious adverse events occurred in pregnant and lactating women who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, and no vaccine-associated mRNA was detected in breast milk collected 4 to 48 hours after vaccination, indicating that the vaccine is safe, although more studies are needed to analyze its effectiveness and impact on the offspring in the future [58–60]. Societies such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) continue to advocate for the availability of COVID-19 vaccine to pregnant and breastfeeding women [61]. WHO revised its statement on January 29, 2021, to allow vaccination of pregnant women at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure (e.g., health workers) or with comorbidities that increase their risk of serious illness after consultation with their health care providers [56].",
            "Based on previous experience with disease pandemics and experience with other respiratory viruses and animal models, increasing maternal choline levels and other nutrient levels may reduce the effects of infection on fetal brain development [25]. Choline supplementation may reduce the increase in fetal IL-6 levels caused by RNA virus stimulation and may decrease anxiety [62]. Maternal choline levels are associated with the development of attention and orienting regulation in early childhood [63]. Maternal vitamin D deficiency was found to lead to altered placental pathology and increased risk of bacterial vaginitis, but excessive vitamin D levels were associated with increased IL-6 levels [64, 65]. Therefore, it is recommended that pregnant women consume vitamin D with folic acid according to a standard prenatal vitamin formula and moderate choline supplementation from beef, egg yolk, and soy.",
            "The use of antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) may be associated with a reduced risk of clinical deterioration in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. It may benefit depression patients with COVID-19 infection, since SSRIs exert anti-inflammatory effects on the damaged striatal neurons [28, 66]. Although using antidepressants during the pregnancy may increase the risk of ASD in offspring [67], a subsequent systematic review did not show an absolute contraindication to antidepressants and there was insufficient evidence of an association between antidepressants and adverse events [68]. Therefore, considering the safety of medication use in pregnant women, clinicians should balance the risks and benefits to develop an optimal treatment strategy on the basis of the actual situation.",
            "Psychotherapy is a safer strategy with less adverse effects than pharmacological treatments. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is currently the most well-studied and popular treatment modality [69]. In view of the fact that maternal stress and hair cortisol levels are associated with motor and cognitive neurodevelopment of the fetus at 6 months of age [70]. A recent randomized controlled trial showed that CBT reduced cortisol levels in the hair of pregnant women and improved psychological stress and psychiatric symptoms [71]. The decreased cortisol levels in the hair are beneficial to the physical and mental health of pregnant women and their fetuses, so the use of CBT for stress and negative emotions could be greatly encouraged.",
            "COVID-19 affects fetal neurological development through multiple pathways during the pregnancy, although most newborns born in a COVID-19 pandemic setting are not directly infected with SARS-CoV-2. We need to pay attention not only to the neurological symptoms of neonatal impairment at birth, but also to the neuropsychiatric symptoms during the growth, and therefore improving the prognosis by early intervention. There is still a need for extensive follow-up studies to determine whether the fetal damage will be continued in adulthood, and new-onset psychiatric symptoms will be developed in adulthood. Most importantly, it is essential to create a safer environment and provide great support for pregnant women and their offspring.",

            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of COVID-19 pandemic (Zhu et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 causes systemic infection varying in severity from asymptomatic, to mild (fever, cough, loss of smell and taste, leg pain, headache, diarrhea, fatigue), to multi-organ dysfunction/failure (Chen N. et al., 2020). Acute lung injury is the hallmark of COVID-19 and a subset of patients develop pneumonia and severe dyspnea requiring ICU admission. Most patients in critical condition have advanced age and pre-existing hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, obesity, and/or chronic lung conditions (Chen N. et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020b). Dyspnea and saturation of 90% or less despite oxygen supplementation is a major risk factor for fatal outcomes (Xie et al., 2020).",
            "Angiotensin 1 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter host cells. ACE2 is highly expressed in lung but widespread distribution of ACE2 provides potential for infection of other organs. ACE2 is a member of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that plays an important role in the homeostasis of the cardiopulmonary system. The RAS consists of a vasoconstrictive, pro-inflammatory, and pro-fibrotic axis that includes angiotensin converting enzyme, angiotensin II and angiotensin type 1 receptor. Actions of this axis are balanced by the vasoprotective axis of the RAS that includes ACE2, angiotensin-(1-7) and MAS). Protective effects of ACE2 against cardiorespiratory diseases have been explored for 20 years (Sharma et al., 2020b).",
            "After binding SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 is endocytosed downregulating cell surface ACE2. This explains the systemic RAS imbalance and increased pro-inflammatory Ang II observed in COVID-19 that intensifies multi-organ damage (Liu et al., 2020). Similarly, while ACE2-knock out mice develop severe acute respiratory distress, mice overexpressing ACE2 develop neither pulmonary hypertension (PH) nor neuroinflammation in a chronic hypoxia model. This illustrates the critical importance of ACE2 in balancing protective and pro-inflammatory effectors of RAS, by converting pro-inflammatory Ang II into beneficial Ang-(1-7). A randomized clinical trial evaluating efficacy, safety, and clinical impact of intravenous Ang-(1-7) vs. standard treatment in ICU patients with COVID-19 is underway (NCT04332666). Rationale for targeting the RAS to minimize systemic manifestations of COVID-19 are discussed in detail elsewhere (Sharma et al., 2020b).",
            "It is becoming increasingly evident that COVID-19 also affects the central nervous system (Asadi-Pooya and Simani, 2020; Chu et al., 2020; Kanberg et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020; Moriguchi et al., 2020; Reichard et al., 2020; Sellner et al., 2020; Solomon et al., 2020; Yashavantha Rao and Jayabaskaran, 2020). However, controversial results regarding direct or indirect effects of SARS-COV-2 in the brain highlight the complexity of this disease and may indicate unique responses in individuals with no discernible common pattern yet uncovered. In vitro studies show that SARS-CoV-2 not only infects, but also replicates in neurons, a phenomenon not observed during SARS-CoV infection (Chu et al., 2020). ACE2 is expressed throughout the CNS, in neurons, glial, endothelial, and arterial smooth muscle cells (Xia and Lazartigues, 2008), allowing virus to infect the brain and impair inter-and intra-cellular communication. An observational study of 214 COVID-19 patients reported 78 patients exhibiting three categories of neurologic manifestation: CNS effects such as dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness (somnolence, stupor, and coma), confusion and delirium in conscious patients, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, seizures; peripheral nervous system effects such as taste, smell or vision impairments, nerve pain, and musculoskeletal injury (Mao et al., 2020). Among 64 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 58 exhibited neurological symptoms (encephalopathy, agitation, confusion, and corticospinal tract signs) (Helms et al., 2020a). A recent MRI-based 3-month follow-up study demonstrates that 55% of patients who recovered from COVID-19 infection had neurological symptoms and exhibited significantly higher gray matter area in brain regions relevant to memory, smell, tremor etc. (Yiping et al., 2020). Together, these data indicate that neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are relatively frequent especially in patients with severe disease, raising questions about mechanism, chronic consequences, and management since neither a vaccine nor specific treatment is available. Evidence supports many routes for CNS effects of SARS-CoV-2. A common sign of SARS-CoV-2 infection is anosmia, resulting from infection of nasal epithelium and olfactory nerve damage. The virus may infect the CNS from this peripheral nerve by crossing synapses (Li et al., 2020) suggesting a peripheral to CNS route of viral transmission and damage. While one study showed that SARS-CoV-2 was not present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 7 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and neurological symptoms, another detected SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in CSF of a 24 year-old man with meningitis/encephalitis (Moriguchi et al., 2020). This suggests viral entry from blood through the choroid plexus, but could also result by virus released from damaged cells in the brain into the CSF. More conclusively, post-mortem study of a 74 year-old man identified virus in the frontal lobe, with viral-like particles in neuronal cell bodies, small vesicles of endothelial cells, and throughout the cerebral microvasculature into neural tissue. This suggests a hematogenous route as a likely pathway to the brain (Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020). While evidence for the influence of COVID-19 in the brain continues to emerge, long-term consequences of this effect remains under investigation.",
            "Nonetheless, plasma biomarkers of neuronal injury and glial activation are positively correlated with severity of COVID-19 symptoms (Kanberg et al., 2020) and were confirmed post-mortem (Reichard et al., 2020). Regardless of viral expression in brain, acute hypoxic ischemic damage was detected in brains of all 18 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Solomon et al., 2020) and may indicate another route to induce neuroinflammation and increase inflammatory cytokines. This resembles the effects of hypoxia in animal models, which are microglia activation, neuroinflammation, autonomic imbalance and increased inflammatory cytokines leading, over time, to pulmonary hypertension (Savale et al., 2009; Oliveira et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2020a).",
            "In addition, patients with severe infection have increased inflammatory responses with CNS-related symptoms as the main form of neurologic injury, indicating indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brain, via pulmonary disease with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (Mao et al., 2020). Comparing 113 deceased with 161 recovered patients revealed increased interleukin (IL) 2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and 20% with hypoxic encephalopathy amongst the deceased (Chen T. et al., 2020). Elevated IL-6 and abnormal permeability of blood meningeal barrier associated with encephalopathy was identified in another cohort with 140 patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19 diagnosis. Eighty-four percent showed abnormal neurological examination and/or delirium with significant worse prognosis compared to patients without delirium and normal neurological exam (Helms et al., 2020b). It might be explained by the intense systemic inflammatory response that leads to blood-brain barrier leakage and higher permeability to peripheral cytokines that exacerbate neuroinflammation and consequently, neurological damage (Cain et al., 2019). Bone marrow-derived cells may also contribute to neuroinflammation as demonstrated in hypertensive rat models. These cells migrate to the CNS and differentiate into microglia-like cells (Santisteban et al., 2015). Interestingly, bone marrow cells from ACE2 deficient mice promoted increases in inflammatory markers, which further contribute to neuroinflammation (Thatcher et al., 2012).",
            "Minocycline is part of the family of tetracycline antibiotics that possess both antibiotic and anti-inflammatory properties. Minocycline has been safely used for more than 40 years which produces beneficial effects in diverse pathophysiological conditions and is emerging as a useful drug in providing neuroprotection as a result of its ability of pass through the blood brain barrier (Garrido-Mesa et al., 2013). Although the precise mechanism of minocycline actions remain elusive, it appears that effects on multiple enzyme systems and pathways could account for its diverse actions. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by preventing aminoacyl-tRNA attachment to the ribosomal acceptor and downregulates the nuclear factor–κ B pathway. In addition, its inhibitory effects on key enzymes like inducible nitric oxide synthase, matrix metalloproteases, phospholipase A2, protein tyrosine nitration, caspases, and other apoptotic molecules, p38 map kinase, poly[ADP] ribose polymerase1 are linked with minocycline's anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective actions (Garrido-Mesa et al., 2013). Minocycline is a highly lipophilic molecule; this property increases its half-life and allows excellent tissue penetration, and it easily crosses the BBB. Finally, minocycline inhibits HIV activation, proliferation and replication in microglia, macrophages, and lymphocytes (Garrido-Mesa et al., 2013).",
            "We recently found neuroinflammation critical in driving PH and impaired brain-lung-gut communication responsible for PH-associated lung pathology; the number of activated microglia was positively correlated with PH severity (Oliveira et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2018). This occurred in various PH models such as hypoxia, Sugen-hypoxia, and monocrotaline-induced PH in rats and mice. Moreover, we demonstrated that targeting neuroinflammation by inhibition of microglia activation could be a novel therapeutic strategy for PH. First, absence of CX3CR1 expression, a condition rendering microglia unable to activate, prevented neuroinflammation and PH induced by hypoxia (Oliveira et al., 2018). Secondly, minocycline, an anti-inflammatory antibiotic also used as a microglial inhibitor, significantly reduced the numbers and activation of microglia in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN), reduced expression of cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, attenuated lung inflammation, heart hypertrophy and sympathetic drive in monocrotaline-treated rats (Sharma et al., 2018). Significant numbers of severely ill COVID-19 patients have diabetes and hypertension, comorbidities where neuroinflammation is an important contributor. Minocycline demonstrated beneficial outcomes in diabetes-linked peripheral and autonomic neuropathy and cognitive impairment in rodents (Syngle et al., 2014; Ismail et al., 2019; Mehta and Banerjee, 2019). Our study with a small group of diabetic, obese and hypertensive patients, with minocycline used on a compassionate basis, showed consistent weight loss, improved HbA1c, improved neuropathic pain and impressive decrease in blood pressure (Yellowlees Douglas et al., 2012). Data from our ongoing trial (NCT02133885) indicate that minocycline decreases blood pressure, active microglia and plasma pro-inflammatory cells in treatment-resistant hypertensive patients. These observations led us to propose the following hypothesis (Figure 1): Minocycline attenuates microglia activation and arrests neuro-inflammation resulting in restoration of normal neuronal-microglia communication, controlling the pro-inflammatory profile especially in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. This decreases the risk of developing long-term CNS consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The following evidence supports our hypothesis: (i) Minocycline is a safe anti-inflammatory drug; (ii) In addition to anti-microbial activity, it is anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, inhibits ion channels and apoptosis and promotes neuronal regeneration in rodents (Miyachi et al., 1986; Rifkin et al., 1994; Tikka et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2007; Nutile-McMenemy et al., 2007). These actions, in addition to its ability to inhibit microglia are likely to contribute to beneficial effects in inflammatory diseases and CNS disorders including stroke (O'Dell, 1999; Naderi et al., 2020); (iii) minocycline has high lipid solubility, readily crossing the BBB; (iv) minocycline is the leading neuroprotective tetracycline, mainly by inhibition of microglia activation (Garrido-Mesa et al., 2013); (v) minocycline treatment effectively decreases inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6 (Sharma et al., 2018), all highly expressed in COVID-patients and related to increased neurological damage (Chen N. et al., 2020); (vi) it is not an antiviral, however, it might act directly on the coronavirus by chelating zinc compounds on matrix metalloproteinase necessary for virus survival, infiltration and replication in the host (Sodhi and Etminan, 2020); (vii) alterations in fecal microbiota in Covid-19 patients were associated with severity and fecal levels of SARS-CoV-2 and gut dysbiosis persisted even after recovery (Zuo et al., 2020). These might also be attenuated by minocycline since it has been shown to modulate the composition of the gut microbiota and attenuate gut pathology in hypertension and depression (Schmidtner et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020); (viii) Its ability to reduce lung inflammation in PH and potentially beneficial effects in diabetes, obesity and hypertension are added bonuses. Finally, COVID-19 is emerging as a complex disease involving multiple organs and patients undergo multiple drug treatment to control diverse symptoms. Therefore, potential drug interactions should be considered before addition of minocycline since this anti-inflammatory antibiotic could produce adverse interactions with anti-viral drugs, other antibiotics and drugs acting on the central nervous system.",
            "Possible sites of action of minocycline for alleviation of neurological manifestations of Covid-19. Neurological manifestations have been extensively reported in COVID-19 patients, and are associated with more severe symptoms. These manifestations may arise by direct and/or indirect mechanisms following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, is expressed in neurons, glial and endothelial cells allowing the virus to infect and spread in the brain, impairing cellular communication. SARS-CoV-2 virus has been demonstrated in brain parenchyma and possible routes for SARS-CoV-2 infiltration such as impaired blood brain barrier are shown. Anosmia, a common sign of SARS-CoV-2 infection reflecting olfactory nerve damage, may illustrate another possible route of virus infiltration, via peripheral nerves to the CNS. Indirect effects on CNS include those from Covid-19-induced hypoxia such as neuroinflammation, impaired neuron-microglia communication, autonomic imbalance, impaired BBB, increased inflammatory cytokines and increased release of BM-derived progenitor cells. This is consistent with experiments in rodents that directly investigated brain damage due to hypoxia. Minocycline, an anti-inflammatory antibiotic that readily penetrates the CNS, counteracts neuroinflammation, virus replication and attenuates the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Together, these actions of minocycline alleviate hypoxia-induced neuroinflammation and impaired neural-microglial communication that may precipitate neuronal and glial injury, thus preventing potential long-term neurological consequences of COVID-19.",
            "The rapid increase in COVID-19 has led to recognition that neurological manifestations are more frequent than initially suspected with unknown long-term nervous system consequences at this early stage of the pandemic. Hundreds of registered clinical trials are currently evaluating the extension of neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients, with some of those aiming to long-term effects on brain functions (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04401449). It will be imperative to better understand whether SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the incidence of, or predisposes to, neurological and neurodegenerative disorders like cognitive impairment and dementia. We need to understand whether the risk applies only to patients with neurological symptoms during initial infection or to all infected patients. This is of concern because while only 11% of rats infected with a related coronavirus exhibited neurological symptoms, 40% of animals without clinically recognized neurological signs had pathological brain lesions 8-months after infection (Nagashima et al., 1979). This suggests that effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the CNS require very close attention, particularly because long-term CNS-effects may emerge in patients without neurological symptoms during initial infection. Therapies that could minimize these consequences would be very valuable.",
            "In conclusion, we believe that not only is there is an urgent need for effective therapies to minimize systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its pro-inflammatory profile, but also to mitigate its CNS effects that are potentially long-term. Minocycline has effective mechanisms to protect the CNS, it attenuates neuroinflammation, counteracts the cytokine storm, modulates gut microbiome, and might inhibit viral replication. If confirmed, our hypothesis may represent an important contribution to prevent neurological impacts of infection and improve COVID-19 management.",

            "COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease but up to two thirds of hospitalised patients show evidence of central nervous system (CNS) damage, predominantly ischaemic, in some cases haemorrhagic and occasionally encephalitic. It is unclear how much of the ischaemic damage is mediated by direct or inflammatory effects of virus on the CNS vasculature and how much is secondary to extracranial cardiorespiratory disease. Limited data suggest that the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus may enter the CNS via the nasal mucosa and olfactory fibres, or by haematogenous spread, and is capable of infecting endothelial cells, pericytes and probably neurons. Extracranially, SARS-CoV-2 targets endothelial cells and pericytes, causing endothelial cell dysfunction, vascular leakage and immune activation, sometimes leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation. It remains to be confirmed whether endothelial cells and pericytes in the cerebral vasculature are similarly targeted. Several aspects of COVID-19 are likely to impact on cognition. Cerebral white matter is particularly vulnerable to ischaemic damage in COVID-19 and is also critically important for cognitive function. There is accumulating evidence that cerebral hypoperfusion accelerates amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and is linked to tau and TDP-43 pathology, and by inducing phosphorylation of α-synuclein at serine-129, ischaemia may also increase the risk of development of Lewy body disease. Current therapies for COVID-19 are understandably focused on supporting respiratory function, preventing thrombosis and reducing immune activation. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are predicted to increase ACE-2 expression, it was initially feared that their use might exacerbate COVID-19. Recent meta-analyses have instead suggested that these medications are protective. This is perhaps because SARS-CoV-2 entry may deplete ACE-2, tipping the balance towards angiotensin II-ACE-1-mediated classical RAS activation: exacerbating hypoperfusion and promoting inflammation. It may be relevant that APOE ε4 individuals, who seem to be at increased risk of COVID-19, also have lowest ACE-2 activity. COVID-19 is likely to leave an unexpected legacy of long-term neurological complications in a significant number of survivors. Cognitive follow-up of COVID-19 patients will be important, especially in patients who develop cerebrovascular and neurological complications during the acute illness.",
            "COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is primarily a respiratory disease but has the capacity to damage other organs including the brain. Similarly to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MER) viruses [1–3], SARS-CoV-2 targets the brain (reviewed [4]) and a growing number of case reports and cohort studies indicate significant neurological disturbance in COVID-19 patients (reviewed [5]). Central nervous system (CNS) involvement including non-specific encephalopathy (headache, confusion, and disorientation) was first documented in 53/214 (25%) hospitalised patients in Wuhan, China [6]. More recent studies in Europe have reported higher rates of CNS involvement: 69% of 58 hospitalised patients in a French Study [7], and 31% of 125 cases with altered mental state, including psychosis and neurocognitive changes, in a recent UK survey [8]. A recent report described a ‘dysexecutive syndrome consisting of inattention, disorientation, or poorly organised movements in response to command’ in 33% of 43 patients discharged from hospital [7]. Moreover, neuroradiological evidence of microstructural damage and disruption of functional brain integrity at 3-month follow-up in recovered COVID-19 patients [9] indicates potential long-term neurological consequences in severely affected COVID-19 patients (reviewed [10]). Acute cerebrovascular disease (CVD), typically presenting as ischaemic stroke but occasionally as intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), has emerged as an important clinical feature in COVID-19 (reviewed in [5]). There have also been multiple case reports of encephalitis with brain-stem involvement (reviewed in [5]). CNS involvement with neurological presentation is more frequent in older and more severely ill COVID-19 patients [6]. Based on the minimum prevalence of neurological complications in SARS and MERS, Ellul et al. [5] estimated that of the reported 4.8 million COVID-19 cases at the time, 1805–9671 had developed CNS complications.",
            "Human coronaviruses are known to target the CNS and cause damage by direct neurotoxicity or activation of the host immune response [1]. The propensity of SARS-CoV-2 to cause cerebral vascular injury greatly increases the risk of chronic brain damage, not only because of the cumulative destructive effect of multifocal cerebral ischaemia or haemorrhage, but potentially also through chronic post-infective complications of CVD, including endothelial and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines within the brain [11]. Long-term cognitive decline and neurodegeneration, with associated hippocampal atrophy [12], were previously reported to complicate systemic inflammation associated with severe sepsis [13, 14]. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a common clinical presentation in COVID-19 patients, is also associated with cognitive decline and neurodegeneration [15, 16]. Long-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients that includes detailed cognitive assessment will be important, to determine the extent and prevalence of long-term neurological and psychiatric consequences of COVID-19 [17], especially in patients who develop cerebrovascular and neurological complications during the acute illness.",
            "In this review, we discuss the pathophysiological processes and risk factors shared by COVID-19 and dementia, focussing particularly on the role of cerebrovascular disease and the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) (Table 1). We consider whether SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase the risk of later developing dementia, particularly in people with underlying cerebrovascular disease and high-risk co-morbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension.\nTable 1Pathophysiological processes contributing to increased risk of chronic neurological disease, including dementia, in COVID-19 patientsReferences1.

            "Unlike in SARS and MERS, COVID-19 patients are at substantial risk of developing acute CVD. Studies to date indicate that CVD has affected 2–6% of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (reviewed in [5]). In a Spanish cohort, 23 of 1683 patients (1.4%) developed CVD, with cerebral ischaemia accounting for 74% and ICH for 23% of the 23 cases [18]. Amongst COVID-19 patients with neurological complications, the reported incidence of CVD is much higher. Acute CVD was diagnosed in 77% of 56 patients admitted to a neurology ward in Italy [19]. In a recent UK-wide survey of 153 COVID-19 cases with neurological and/or psychiatric disturbance, most patients (62% of 125), for whom a full clinical dataset was available, had had a cerebrovascular event, compared to 31% with encephalopathy; of those with CVD, 74% had presented with ischaemic stroke, 12% with ICH, and 1% with CNS vasculitis [8]. A common theme across most of these studies is the predominance of CVD in older patients in association with more severe disease, and in those with co-morbidities, including hypertension, diabetes and underlying cerebrovascular disease [20]. However, large-vessel stroke has also been reported in younger adults with COVID-19 [21].",
            "The pathophysiology of CVD in COVID-19 has yet to be fully determined (Fig. 1). Inflammation-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often complicated by pulmonary embolism, has been documented in a high proportion of patients with neurovascular complications and is likely to be a major contributor to most acute CVD events in COVID-19 [22], especially in younger healthy adults. A recent review [23] highlighted a number of pathways involving localised endothelial cell dysfunction, vascular leakage and unregulated immune activation that contribute to DIC formation in ARDS in COVID-19 patients. Activation of the kallikrein-bradykinin system leading to reduced blood flow, upregulation of adhesion molecules that mediate leucocyte recruitment, activation of platelets and neutrophils, and increased inflammation and immune surveillance all potentially contribute to vascular damage (and pulmonary injury) in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 has also been shown to target and infect endothelial cells in vascular beds in multiple tissues [24], but it remains to be confirmed whether endothelial cells in the cerebral vasculature are similarly targeted.\nFig. 1Mechanisms of cerebrovascular damage in COVID-19. a The virus reaches the central nervous system through inhalation (1) and lung infection followed by haematogenous spread (2), or through the nasal mucosa and olfactory nerve fibres (3). b A high proportion of COVID-19 patients with severe disease develop cerebrovascular disease. In addition to hypoxic-ischaemic brain damage from compromised respiratory and cardiovascular function, the virus may cause large-vessel stroke, multiple small infarcts and foci of haemorrhage, and diffuse ischaemic white matter damage and oedema. Putative mechanisms are illustrated in the diagram. c Already, considerable progress has been made in preventing or ameliorating cerebrovascular damage in COVID-19. Some of the approaches are listed here",

            "Most studies to date have implicated vascular dysfunction and ischaemic damage in the major neurological complications associated with COVID-19. Post-mortem neuropathological examination in 18 COVID-19 cases showed all to have acute hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury affecting the cerebrum and cerebellum, with rare foci of perivascular inflammation in two of the brains but no convincing evidence of virus within the CNS [25]. MR imaging of autopsy brains from deceased COVID-19 patients within 24 h of death revealed white matter changes including foci of haemorrhage in two cases and evidence of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in another [26]. Plasma markers of neuronal and astrocyte injury (neurofilament light chain protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein) were elevated in COVID-19 patients and associated with disease severity [27]. The authors concluded that further studies were needed to assess the relationship of brain damage to ischaemic and inflammatory processes. The key unanswered question is how much damage is mediated by direct effects of virus on the CNS parenchyma or vasculature (damage that would be expected to persist after the virus is cleared from the CNS), how much is indirect CNS vascular injury mediated by immune activation, and how much is hypoxic-ischaemic damage secondary to the extracranial effects of the virus on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems.",
            "Both SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA have been detected within brain tissue in human post-mortem studies, the antigen mainly within the medulla and lower cranial nerves [28]. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in cerebrospinal fluid from a patient with viral encephalitis [29] and was observed at autopsy in neural and capillary endothelial cells in COVID-19 brain tissue [30]. These observations need to be confirmed in further studies, particularly given the high Ct values used for the PCR detection of viral RNA and the difficulty of electron microscopic interpretation of virus-like particles. Although retrograde axonal transport via the olfactory bulb, associated with anosmia, is a potential route for neuroinvasion, it is likely that the cerebral vasculature plays a more important role in entry of the virus into the CNS. ACE-2, the principal SARS-CoV-2 receptor, is highly expressed by endothelial cells [31] and pericytes throughout the body [32] and analysis of publicly available databases indicates that ACE-2 is also expressed in the brain [33].",
            "Despite apparent low levels of ACE-2 mRNA within the brain [34–37], SARS-Cov-2 infects induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human neural stem and progenitor cells, neurospheres, and cortical neurons with brain organoids (all of which express ACE-2) [38–41]. These data suggest that the mRNA levels do not necessary reflect ACE-2 protein or enzyme activity within the brain, although we would point out that some of the information (e.g. [38–41]) has been published only on preprint servers; peer review may lead to modification of the conclusions. We and others have detected ACE-2 immunohistochemically within the cerebral vasculature in human post-mortem brains [38, 42] and a pre-published study by the Betsholtz lab indicates that ACE-2 is also enriched in brain pericytes [43]. In addition to ACE-2, other docking receptors for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, including basigin (BSG, CD147) (preprint [44]) and neuropilin (NRP1) (preprint [45]), and these are highly expressed in endothelial cells and pericytes [46]. These receptors may have an important role to play, alongside or separately to ACE-2, in viral entry and disease pathogenesis (reviewed [46]).",
            "Activation of the cerebral endothelium in a range of disease states, including AD, is associated with increased expression of integrins and selectins that are responsible for the attachment, tethering and passage of immune cells across the BBB. This leads to infiltration of brain tissue by immune cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, contributing to the pathogenesis of disease (reviewed [47]). In view of the activation of endothelium and inflammatory cell infiltration in lung and other tissues in COVID-19, it is conceivable that activation of the cerebral endothelium and infiltration by immune cells also contributes to neurological disturbance in many patients, although this too remains to be determined.",
            "Pericytes are mural cells located within the basement membrane of microvessels [48] and communicate with endothelial cells to maintain integrity of the BBB [49] and regulate essential vascular functions: blood flow [50] and neurovascular coupling, endothelial transcytosis [51], and angiogenesis [52]. Transcriptomic analysis of murine heart [32, 53] and brain [54–56] indicates that pericytes express high levels of ACE-2 and are therefore likely targets of SARS-CoV-2. Lung biopsies from 4 hospitalised Covid-19 patients revealed a dramatic reduction in pericyte coverage of alveolar capillaries in addition to thickening of the capillary wall [57]. Pericyte degeneration and the consequent disruption of endothelial signalling and homeostasis are likely to be important contributors to vascular instability in COVID-19 [32]. In pericyte-deficient mice (Pdgfrbret/ret), levels of von Willebrand factor, which promotes platelet aggregation and coagulation, are elevated, suggesting that pericyte loss contributes to the pro-angiogenic response in COVID-19 patients [43]. These studies implicate pericyte dysfunction as a mediator of pathophysiology in COVID-19. It is not yet known whether pericytes within the brain degenerate or become dysfunctional in COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations.",
            "A recent study has provided further evidence of the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 [38]. The authors demonstrated ACE-2-dependent infection of nerve cells within human brain organoids, and hypoxia-like metabolic changes and damage in neighbouring uninfected cells. Expression of humanised ACE-2 within the brain of mice experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 caused vascular remodelling throughout the cortex and greatly increased their mortality. The authors examined brain tissue from three COVID-19 patients and reported that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could be detected immunohistochemically within the walls of small vessels cortical adjacent to microinfarcts. They also reported spike protein immunopositivity in some cortical neurons. However, these findings need to be confirmed.",
            "Pre-existing dementia ranks as one of the most significant risk factors, or co-morbidities, in COVID-19. Retrospective assessment of UK health records in the UK OpenSAFELY platform indicated a hazard ratio of 2.16 (fully adjusted model) in association with pre-existing dementia/stroke [58]. An odds ratio of 3.07 was associated with dementia in a UK biobank community study [59]. The reasons for the increased risk and mortality in patients with pre-existing dementia have been well reviewed [60]. What is perhaps not as widely appreciated is that the types of brain damage seen in COVID-19 are themselves major contributors to cognitive decline and dementia.",
            "Ischaemic brain damage is the defining pathological process in vascular dementia (VaD), and stroke is a major risk factor for dementia [61, 62]. Thromboembolic occlusion of cerebral blood vessels, a major complication of DIC, can cause a wide spectrum of neurological deficits, including cognitive impairment or dementia. Single or multiple infarcts, as a result of thromboembolism affecting major cerebral arteries, are estimated to account for approximately 20% of dementia cases associated with stroke [63]. It is probable that acute large cerebral vascular occlusion associated with hypercoagulability in severely affected COVID-19 patients will increase the risk of dementia to some extent.",
            "Small vessel disease (SVD) accounts for about 20% of all strokes [64] but about 80% of stroke-related dementia cases [63], and is the most common cause of vascular cognitive impairment. SVD-associated neuroimaging abnormalities of the white matter and arteriolosclerosis of cerebral microvessels can be demonstrated in about 50% of all patients with dementia [65, 66]. Co-morbidities of SVD include hypertension and diabetes [67] (both also risk factors for severe COVID-19). Hypercoagulability and disseminated intravascular coagulation that affect many patients with severe COVID-19 are likely to reduce perfusion through small intracerebral vessels more than through larger ones. SARS-COV-2 induces endothelial dysfunction [23] and infects vascular beds in multiple tissues [24]. Cerebral white matter is particularly vulnerable to changes in cerebral blood flow, as would be expected in association with diffuse small vessel dysfunction and has been reported in COVID-19 [68–70]. The integrity of subcortical white matter is critically important for maintenance of cognitive function [71, 72], and one of the consequences of white matter damage in COVID-19 is likely to be cognitive impairment. This was highlighted by the neuroradiological demonstration that damage to white matter and disruption of functional integrity in brain regions such as the hippocampus, at 3-month follow-up in recovered COVID-19 patients, was associated with memory loss [9].",
            "The pathophysiology of SVD remains incompletely understood but damage to endothelial cells and pericytes, as well as BBB leakiness, are contributors to SVD-related brain injury (reviewed [66, 73]), which are likely to be exacerbated in severe COVID-19. Endothelial dysfunction and pericyte loss are associated with the cerebral influx and accumulation of toxic constituents of the plasma, such as fibrinogen, leading to oligodendrocyte damage and myelin loss [74]. Fibrinogen-mediated activation of the bone morphogenetic protein signalling pathway prevents maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and restricts oligodendrocyte maturation and remyelination [75]. The infiltration of immune cells across a damaged BBB may also contribute to white matter damage and cognitive decline in dementia and perhaps COVID-19 (reviewed [47]). In addition, endothelial dysfunction and loss of pericytes are likely to impair the clearance of cerebral metabolites, including Aβ peptides, that are toxic when present in excess. Impaired drainage of metabolites including Aβ is implicated in the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer’s disease [76, 77] and ineffective drainage of solutes probably accounts for enlargement of perivascular spaces in patients with SVD (reviewed [78, 79] and cerebral amyloid angiopathy ([80–82]).",
            "Several other factors may impact on cerebral perfusion during systemic infection. Increased blood viscosity tends to slow capillary transit and limit oxygen delivery. Damage to the glycocalyx, a carbohydrate-enriched matrix on the luminal side of capillaries may impair perfusion and exacerbate ischaemia [83, 84]. Many of the deleterious alterations to small vessels in systemic infection are exacerbated by the same risk factors that predispose to severe COVID-19, such as ageing, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.",
            "Post-mortem and neuroimaging studies indicate that ischaemic damage to the cerebral white matter is present in up to two thirds of patients with AD [85–87]. Although cerebral amyloid angiopathy may contribute to the damage, in most cases the ischaemia-related damage probably results from a combination of arteriolosclerotic SVD and non-structural vascular dysfunction (reviewed [88]). A series of recent neuroimaging studies has shown that ischaemic white matter damage occurs at a very early stage of AD, accelerates progression of the disease and contributes to the cognitive decline [89–93]. These clinical observations are supported by experimental studies showing that brain ischaemia accelerates Aβ accumulation, through a combination of dysregulated processing of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and impaired Aβ clearance (reviewed [87]) and that, in turn, Aβ peptides mediate vasoconstriction, by inducing contraction of pericytes [94] and vascular smooth muscle cells [95]. Studies of microvascular endothelial cell monolayers [96, 97], human APP transgenic mouse models [98], and on human post-mortem brain tissue [99] indicate that Aβ peptides also impair BBB function, in part by reducing expression of tight junction proteins. Pericyte degeneration in AD is associated with BBB breakdown [100–102]. Pericyte loss accelerates Aβ pathology and induces tau pathology and cognitive decline in human APP mice [103]. In human brain tissue from AD patients, a decline in the level of the pericyte marker, platelet-derived growth factor-β (PDGFRβ), was associated with increased Aβ level and reduced cerebral perfusion [104]. Aβ peptides are toxic to human brain pericytes in culture [105] and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid indicates that the level of soluble PDGFRβ, a marker of pericyte injury and BBB leakiness, is elevated in the elderly in association with the earliest detectable changes in cognitive performance [89, 90].",
            "There is increasing evidence that cerebral hypoperfusion is also linked to tau pathology. In clinically normal adults with positron emission tomography (PET) evidence of cerebral Aβ accumulation, those who also had an increased cardiovascular disease risk score were significantly more likely to show evidence of tau accumulation as well [106]. In patients with mild cognitive impairment, increased cerebrovascular burden was associated with elevated PET-Tau signal and worse cognitive performance, independently of Aβ-PET [107]. Several experimental studies have shown that modelling of cerebral hypoperfusion increases tau phosphorylation: in adult Wistar rats [108], transgenic mice with Aβ and tau accumulation [109], and rat and human brain slices exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation [110]. In a recent autopsy study, elevated levels of soluble tau and insoluble phospho-tau were associated with lower levels of endothelial tight junction proteins, claudin-5 and occludin, in AD [111]. Tau-overexpressing mice were shown to have abnormal blood vessel morphology and increased vessel density [112]. A recent study found impaired neurovascular coupling, prior to neurodegeneration, in young (2–3 months) mice expressing mutant tau [113]. There are therefore clinical and experimental data suggesting a bidirectional relationship between cerebral vascular dysfunction and pathological tau. There is evidence from recent studies that TDP-43 pathology, likewise, is associated with cerebral vascular dysfunction, including pericyte loss and small vessel disease [114, 115]. Lastly, cerebral ischaemia induces phosphorylation of α-synuclein at serine-129; this is the predominant disease-related modification of α-synuclein in Lewy bodies and neurites in Parkinson disease, and dementia with Lewy bodies, and also is significantly associated with concomitant AD pathology in these Lewy body diseases [116].",
            "Both cerebral ischaemia and systemic inflammation can induce endothelial activation, with increased expression of integrins and selectins leading to adhesion and transendothelial migration of leukocytes into the brain parenchyma. Endothelial activation, with recruitment of leukocytes, has also been shown in AD [47, 117]. Leukocytes enter the brain through post-capillary venules within the parenchyma, and to a lesser extent, vessels in the leptomeninges and choroid plexus. Activated neutrophils in cerebral vessels and parenchyma were found to contribute to gliosis and cognitive impairment in human APP mice [118]. In APP/PS1 mice, respiratory infection increased infiltration of the brain by interferon γ- and interleukin-17-producing T cells and natural killer T cells, accompanied by gliosis and enhanced deposition of Aβ [119]. Monocytes are the most common type of peripheral immune cell that migrates via the BBB into the brain in AD. CCL2, the major ligand for CCR2 expressed on monocytes, is upregulated in microvessels in AD and plays a role in Aβ clearance (reviewed [47]). Whether endothelial activation predicts not only acute but also longer neurological complications (including dementia) in COVID-19 remains to be determined.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 cell attachment and entry are initiated by binding of the virus to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) [120]. The expression of ACE-2 at the cell surface is therefore likely to be a critical determinant of viral tropism and pathobiology in COVID-19. ACE-2 is expressed in stem cell-derived neurons [121] and in neuronal and glial cells within the brain [33, 42], potentially enabling virus entry and spread through the cribriform plate by retrograde axonal transport along olfactory nerves [33], or from sensory fibres that pass from the lungs to the brain stem via the vagal nerve and nodose ganglion [4]. ACE-2 is also expressed in the temporal lobe and hippocampus—brain regions that are involved in cognition and memory and are affected in AD [122]. Neuronal uptake and spread within the brain were demonstrated in human ACE-2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-1 [123] and SARS-CoV-2 [124]. However, as noted above, ACE-2 is also highly expressed on endothelial cells and pericytes, and haematogenous spread followed by endothelial uptake or influx of infected peripheral immune cells are further possible routes of entry of virus into the brain.",
            "During SARS-Cov-1 infection, ACE-2 is cleaved from the cell surface [125] by ADAM-17 [126] during viral entry [127]. Although likely, it remains to be determined whether SARS-CoV-2 similarly results in loss of cell membrane-associated ACE-2. Ordinarily, ACE-2 is a key effector of the regulatory RAS that counters the actions of the classical RAS and reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (reviewed [128, 129]), stroke [130–132], and dementia [133] (Fig. 2). ACE-2 is reduced in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [42] and cognitive decline is pronounced in ACE-2 knock-out mice [134]. If SARS-CoV-2 entry leads to loss of ACE-2 (as in SARS), angiotensin II-mediated classical RAS activation would increase the risk of cerebrovascular and neurological disturbances in COVID-19 patients. This mechanism has also been proposed to explain other vascular and pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 [135, 136]. Internalisation of ACE2, as a result of angiotensin II activation of angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1R), may further exacerbate damage [137]. The available reservoir of ACE-2 may be an important determinant of clinical outcome in COVID-19. Studies in rodents indicate that ACE-2 expression declines with age and is lower in males [138–141]. In contrast, oestrogen upregulates ACE-2, which could help to protect pre-menopausal women against severe complications of COVID-19 [142, 143]. It may be relevant that most co-morbidities that increase the risk of complications in COVID-19, including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, are associated overactivity of the classical RAS. Indeed ethnicity and genetic variations also influence baseline ACE-2 levels [144] and could provide a biological explanation as to why some ethnic groups are at higher risk of COVID-19 [145]. The hypothesis would explain why angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 inhibitors (ACE-Is), which downregulate the classical RAS by either blocking angiotensin II (Ang-II) signalling or Ang-II synthesis, respectively, and upregulate ACE-2, may reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients [146, 147].\nFig. 2Altered balance between the classical and regulatory parts of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in COVID-19. a Ang-II is formed by the ACE-1-mediated cleavage of Ang-I. The binding of Ang-II to AT1R within the vasculature not only induces vasoconstriction but also affects vascular permeability and neurovascular coupling and promotes neuroinflammation and oxidative stress within the CNS. Under normal circumstances, these actions are counteracted by ACE-2 activity, which leads to the production of Ang-1-9 and Ang-(1-7) and the activation of MasR. b Internalisation or cleavage of membrane-bound ACE-2 following the binding and cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to downregulation of the regulatory RAS and overaction of the classical RAS, driving vascular dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress and CNS injury in COVID-19",

            "An imbalance in RAS contributes to acute ARDS (reviewed [148]), which develops in a high proportion of the COVID-19 patients who develop viral pneumonia [149, 150]. ARDS patients show overactivity of the classical RAS [151] and reduction of ACE-2 [152, 153]. Increased Ang-II-mediated AT1R signalling, which drives inflammation [154], is likely to contribute to the inflammatory storm in severe COVID-19. Lung tissue damage in ARDS can be reduced by ARBs and ACEIs [155] and by administration of recombinant ACE-2 [152, 156]. ACE-2 catalyses the formation of Ang-(1-7), which binds to Mas receptor; both ACE-2 activation [157] and Ang-(1-7) activation of Mas receptor attenuate lung injury in ARDS [158]. Ang-(1-7) activates ERK1/2 signalling and modulates interleukin (IL)-10 expression, protecting against lung damage (reviewed [159]).",
            "Recombinant soluble ACE-2 (rsACE-2) shows therapeutic promise in severe COVID-19 infection; administration was reported to reduce viral titre and serum Ang-II, elevate serum Ang-(1-7) levels and markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines [160]. In addition to preventing viral binding, rsACE-2-mediated reduction in Ang-II is likely to prevent AT1R-mediated ADAM-17 cleavage of membrane-bound ACE-2 and restore balance in the RAS [161].",
            "The RAS is expressed and functions independently within the brain. Overactivation of the classical RAS, with elevated ACE-1 and Ang-II, has been demonstrated in post-mortem human brain tissue in AD [162–164]. Cerebroventricular infusion of Ang-II into adult Wistar rats promoted Aβ production and tau pathology [165, 166], and ARBs and ACEIs protect against cognitive decline and disease pathology in transgenic APP mouse models of AD (reviewed [167]). We previously reported that reduction of ACE-2 in brain tissue in AD correlated strongly with parenchymal Aβ and tau levels and with increased ACE-1 activity [42]. We and others have since shown that induction of ACE-2, or administration of Ang-(1-7) or peptide analogues, protects against Aβ-related cognitive decline in mice associated with reduced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress [133, 168, 169].",
            "The RAS is a critical regulator of vascular function. Ang-II binds to AT1R on vascular smooth muscle cells [170, 171] to induce cerebral artery constriction [172], and on pericytes to cause constriction of microvessels [173, 174]. Ang-II also modulates BBB permeability: AT1R signalling induces leakiness in endothelial cell culture models of the BBB [175] and Ang-II infusion causes BBB leakiness in mice that can be reversed by adding a superoxide scavenger, indicating a role for oxidative stress [176]. Several mediators of BBB leakiness, including vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, are induced by Ang-II [177–179]. In mice, Ang-II was shown to impair neurovascular coupling (i.e. the blood flow response to increased neural activity) in the somatosensory cortex [180] and to interfere with cerebral autoregulation [181, 182]. The accumulation of ACE-1 in the extracellular matrix around cerebral arterioles (particularly in AD patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy) suggests that locally produced (as well as circulatory) Ang-II participates in cerebrovascular dysfunction mediated by overactivation of the classical RAS [163].",
            "Overactivation of the classical RAS may also reduce clearance of Aβ. Intra-mural peri-arterial drainage (IPAD) and para-vascular glymphatic channels have been implicated in the removal of Aβ from the brain [183–185]. The functioning of these drainage pathways depends on the polarised expression of aquaporin-4 in astrocytic endfeet [186], which is regulated by pericytes [187]. Focal absence of pericytes results in the redistribution of aquaporin-4 to the cell soma [51]. The RAS modulates aquaporin-4 expression in astrocytes [188], and Ang-II was shown to act via AT1R to reduce ACE-2 expression in astrocyte cultures [189]. These alterations in pericyte and astrocyte function are likely to impair the clearance of Aβ. It remains to be determined whether this occurs in COVID-19.",
            "Neuroinflammation is strongly implicated in the development of AD. Genome-wide association studies have identified several inflammatory pathway genes as risk factors for AD [190, 191]. Complement [192] and inflammasome activation [193, 194] are likely to contribute to cerebrovascular dysfunction, neuronal toxicity, and the accumulation of Aβ and tau in AD. Ang-II activates the complement system [195, 196] and the NLRP3 inflammasome [197], and both complement [198] and inflammasome activation [11] have been proposed to contribute to neurological disease in COVID-19 patients. A recent in silico study implicated SARS-CoV-2 activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a major contributor to the inflammatory response in COVID-19 [199]. Ang-II upregulates TLR4 [200], which is a critical determinant of Ang-II-mediated vascular remodelling [201]. Blocking of TLR4 signalling delayed the development of Ang-II-mediated hypertension in rats and was associated with a dramatic increase in ACE-2 [202]. Pericytes express high levels of TL4R, activated by free long-chain fatty-acids [203]. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to bind to linoleic acid, affecting the conformation of the protein and possibly the binding of the virus to ACE-2 (pre-published study [204]). It may therefore be relevant that linoleic acid is reduced in both COVID-19 [205] and AD [206], potentially influencing the progression of both diseases. Ang-II also acts as a molecular switch regulating microglial phenotype—switching between an M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (immunoregulatory) protective phagocytic phenotype [207] which is relevant to AD pathogenesis [208]. The role of microglia in neurological manifestations of COVID-19 has yet to be fully explored.",
            "Ang-II-mediated endothelial activation promotes the binding and diapedesis of leukocytes across the BBB; these effects are mitigated by Ang-1-7 [209]. Pericytes too have immune-regulating properties (reviewed in [210]) and their localisation within the cerebral vasculature suggests that they may serve a ‘gate-keeper’ role in regulating immune cell infiltration. Although pericytes express ACE-2, it remains to be established whether they are targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Because of the pivotal role of pericytes in regulation of cerebrovascular function (and perhaps immune cell infiltration), it is likely that virus-induced pericyte damage would compromise cerebral perfusion, BBB integrity, and immune regulation. In addition to vascular effects, angiotensin peptides derived from Ang-II, including Ang-IV and Ang-(1-7), have neuromodulatory [211] (reviewed [212]) and neuroprotective properties (reviewed [213]). Ang-(1-7) activation of Mas (regulatory RAS) receptor and Ang-IV activation of the c-Met and insulin-regulated aminopeptidase receptors (reviewed [214]) limit tissue damage in models of stroke (reviewed [215, 216]). Similarly, ACE-2 activation and/or Ang-(1-7) infusion prevents cognitive decline and disease pathology in animal models of Aβ accumulation [133, 169, 217, 218], independent of changes in blood pressure. There is therefore a wide range of mechanisms through which reduced regulatory RAS signalling may exacerbate brain damage in COVID-19.",
            "APOE polymorphism greatly influences the risk of developing AD: the risk is increased with APOE ε4 and decreased with APOE ε2 [219, 220]. The physiological roles of the encoded apolipoprotein (apolipoprotein E, ApoE) have still not been fully defined. Recent studies indicate that possession of APOE ε4 is associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction, including BBB leakiness and pericyte degeneration [221] and cerebral amyloid angiopathy with capillary involvement [222]. A recent UK study reported that there was a higher prevalence of COVID-19 in people who were carriers of APOE ε4 [223]. We previously showed that APOE ε4 individuals also have lowest ACE-2 activity [42]. Pericyte expression of APOE ε4 was reported to promote BBB leakiness because of deficient basement membrane formation [224]. Moreover, possession of APOE ε4 is associated with reduced cerebral blood flow and increased subcortical ischaemic white matter damage [225, 226], as well as neuroinflammation in AD (reviewed [227]). Future studies should aim to clarify the relationships between APOE ε4, COVID-19, and cerebral vascular dysfunction and AD.",
            "ACE-2 is cleaved by ADAM-17 upon SARS-Cov-1 entry into cells [125–127]. It seems likely that this also occurs upon SARS-Cov-2 cell entry, although the data are not yet available. Ang-II-mediated activation of ADAM-17 and shedding of ACE-2 points to a positive feedback loop in which increased Ang-II level is associated with loss of ACE-2 [228]. Yet, it is worthy of note that ADAM-17 cleaves many cell-associated proteins that are required for proper function of the vasculature including the ApoE receptor, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1), involved in transendothelial clearance of Aβ (facilitated by ApoE), and PDGFRβ, needed for maintenance of pericytes. Upregulation of ADAM-17 may therefore potentially exacerbate vascular dysfunction in COVID-19. ADAM-17 also acts as one of the α-secretases and cleaves APP, preventing the generation of Aβ (reviewed [229]). The complex divergent roles of ADAM-17 in AD and potentially COVID-19 require further investigation.",
            "In severe COVID-19, patients present with pneumonia and those most severely affected develop ARDS with features of septic shock and multiple organ failure, requiring oxygen treatment and/or mechanical ventilation. Infection-induced inflammatory and vascular changes associated with coagulopathy and thrombosis, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), DIC and thrombotic microangiopathy with thromboembolic microvascular complications, are common complications of severe COVID-19, as illustrated by reports of VTE in 25–27% hospitalised patients [230, 231]. The International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) recommends measuring levels of d-dimer, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and platelet count, in hospitalised COVID-19 patients [232]. A retrospective study in Wuhan, China, at the beginning of the pandemic, found that mortality rates were lower in patients given low-molecular weight heparin [233]. Clinical management of severe COVID-19 patients now routinely includes low-dose sub-cutaneous heparin [233] and/or thrombotic prophylaxis [234], unless patients are at increased risk of bleeding.",
            "Lymphopenia with marked loss of regulatory T and B cells and natural killer cells, reduction in monocytes, eosinophils and basophils, and an increase in neutrophils are typical in severe COVID-19 (reviewed [235]). There are also elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, sometimes marked (a so-called cytokine storm). Convalescent plasma [236] and plasma exchange [237, 238] improve survival rates in severe disease, and immunomodulatory therapies such as tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor [239], and sarilumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist [240], may offer protection and are currently undergoing clinical trials. Neutralising antibodies targeting other pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-17) may also offer protection, as too may potential inhibitors of complement system activation. Intravenous transplantation of mesenchymal stems cells was shown to improve the outcome of COV-19 patients with pneumonia in 7 COVID-19 patients in Beijing, China [241]. It seems possible that mesenchymal stem cells might also ameliorate brain injury in severe COVID-19, given their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, and ability to attenuate BBB damage and neuroinflammation after cerebral ischaemia [242–244].",
            "There is continued debate on the role of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients. Although earlier studies indicated a lack of benefit from corticosteroids [245], a randomised clinical trial reported by the RECOVERY collaborative group, Oxford, UK, found that systemic dexamethasone reduced mortality in severely affected COVID-19 patients [246]. Inhaled steroids had previously been shown to reduce inflammation and tissue injury in ARDS [247] (reviewed [248]). In addition to their inherent anti-inflammatory properties, steroids may have anti-viral properties [249]. Ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, was shown to suppress replication of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [250].",
            "The expression and activity of interferon-β (IFN-β), an endogenous protein with anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, is impaired in COVID-19 [251]. Interferon inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro [252]. In a Phase II clinical trial, IFN-β in combination with anti-viral drugs shortened the duration of viral shedding and length of hospital admission [253]. A pharmaceutical company based in the UK, Synairgen, reported a lower risk of requiring ventilation, and reduction in mortality by about 79%, in a Phase II clinical trial of SNG001, an inhaled form of IFN-β (these data are currently unpublished).",
            "Since ACE-2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and ACEIs and ARBs are predicted to increase ACE-2 expression, it was initially feared that the use of these drugs might exacerbate COVID-19 [254]. Recent meta-analyses have instead suggested that RAS-targeting medications are protective in COVID-19 [146, 147, 255]. This is likely to be a due to the protective role of ACE-2 in lowering or preventing overactivation of the classical RAS and minimising consequent Ang-II-mediated ischaemic and inflammatory damage, as outlined above. Several clinical trials have been registered with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to test ARBs such as losartan in COVID-19 patients: NCT04335123, NCT04312009 and NCT04311177. Two studies are also investigating the impact of discontinuation of ACE-Is on COVID-19 (EudraCT numbers 2020-001544-26 and 2020-001206-35). Boosting the regulatory arm of the RAS may ameliorate COVID-19 because of the protective effects of ACE-2 and Ang-(1-7); interventional trials with recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) and Ang-(1–7) have also been registered (NCT04287686 and NCT04332666, respectively), although the rhACE2 study seeking to recruit people between the ages 18–80 years in China has since been withdrawn. A further rhACE2 study (2020-001172-15) is registered on the EU Clinical trials register. Other strategies being explored include several studies seeking to inhibit TMPRSS2. Studies that could include TL4R blockers and ADAM-17 inhibitors might also be worthy of future study. For a comprehensive review of the pharmacological targets that are currently being investigated as potential interventions and treatments in COVID-19, the reader should refer to recent reviews [256–258].",
            "Cerebral vascular disease is emerging as a major complication of severe COVID-19. This is likely to cause lasting brain damage and to increase the risk of stroke and vascular cognitive impairment. Several of the metabolic abnormalities that affect COVID-19 patients may also increase the risk of developing AD. Dementia and COVID-19 share many co-morbidities and risk factors, including age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, obesity and possession of APOE ε4—most of which are associated with an overactive RAS, cerebrovascular dysfunction and neuroinflammation. These shared co-morbidities and similar mechanisms may also explain the high incidence and increased rates of mortality amongst people with dementia [59, 259, 260]. There is urgent need for research to better understand the pathogenesis of neurological disturbances in COVID-19, some of which have probably been covert and the prevalence of which may be considerably underestimated. This understanding is essential to establish the long-term consequences from the disease (including the potential for increased risk of dementia in some cases) and to identify means of preventing or ameliorating the brain damage.",

            "A novel syndrome called long-haul COVID or long COVID is increasingly recognized in a significant percentage of individuals within a few months after infection with SARS-CoV-2. This disorder is characterized by a wide range of persisting, returning or even new but related symptoms that involve different tissues and organs, including respiratory, cardiac, vascular, gastrointestinal, musculo-skeletal, neurological, endocrine and systemic. Some overlapping symptomatologies exist between long COVID and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Very much like with long ME/CFS, infections with herpes family viruses, immune dysregulation, and the persistence of inflammation have been reported as the most common pattern for the development of long COVID. This review describes several factors and determinants of long COVID that have been proposed, elaborating mainly on viral persistence, reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein–Barr virus and human herpesvirus 6 which are also associated with the pathology of ME/CFS, viral superantigen activation of the immune system, disturbance in the gut microbiome, and multiple tissue damage and autoimmunity. Based on these factors, we propose diagnostic strategies such as the measurement of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, EBV, HHV-6, viral superantigens, gut microbiota, and biomarkers of autoimmunity to better understand and manage this multi-factorial disorder that continues to affect millions of people in the world.",
            "Many individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 do not show severe symptoms and completely recover from the virus after a short period of time. However, there are others that experience a range of symptoms including flu-like, respiratory, digestive and cognitive symptoms, loss of smell or taste, fatigue, and skin lesions. The severity and recovery time for each case varies depending on each patient’s previous health history [1,2]. This inter-individual difference in combatting the virus is dependent on the gene as well as the exposome [3,4]. The exposome is an individual’s lifetime exposure to a variety of external and internal factors [5,6].",
            "Although most COVID-19 infections resolve within two weeks, prolonged follow-up case studies have shown that approximately 30% of individuals who have supposedly recovered from the disease continue to suffer from some sort of associated symptomatology over an extended period of time. This phenomenon has been termed many names, from Post-Acute COVID Syndrome (PACS) to Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) to long-haul COVID and many others, but it is most commonly known as long COVID [7,8,9].",
            "The World Health Organization (WHO) describes long COVID as a wide range of new, returning or ongoing health problems that people experience more than a month after initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The main symptoms of long COVID currently include fatigue, brain fog, difficulty sleeping, arthralgia, myalgia, pharyngitis, fever, headaches, gastrointestinal symptoms, skin rashes, and affective symptoms including depression and anxiety, which are symptoms similar to those that present during the initial infection [10,11,12,13,14,15].",
            "Patients who suffer from these symptoms had different degrees of COVID-19 severity [9]. Overall, though, the more severe degrees of COVID-19 infection are associated with multiple early factors and the induction of more severe long COVID [15]. This is indicated by findings that a large part of the variance in long COVID fatigue and affective symptoms is predicted by increased peak body temperature and lowered blood oxygenation, which both indicate activate immune-inflammatory pathways, during acute COVID-19 infection [15].",
            "Although the causes of long COVID are beginning to emerge, understanding the complex biology and pathophysiology of this disorder is a crucial step toward the prevention, treatment, or reversal of this condition [16]. In this regard, we may learn from the role of various pathogens in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), which is one of the major symptoms of long COVID [17]. ME/CFS is a complicated chronic illness in which fatigue and exhaustion reduce a person’s physical activity by more than 50%, leaving the individual bed-ridden or house-bound [18,19]. Very much like with long COVID, infections have been reported as the most common pattern for the onset of ME/CFS, especially when the beneficial sickness behavior responses are insufficient [20,21].",
            "In fact, over the years, several viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and human herpes type 6 (HHV-6) have been studied as proposed models for the pathophysiology of ME/CFS [17,21,22,23,24,25,26]. These and other viral infections may be responsible for the overlapping symptomatologies such as fatigue, post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbance, affective symptoms and lightheadedness that are found in both long COVID and ME/CFS [27]. How these chronic symptoms develop is unclear, but in the case of SARS-CoV-2, persisting SARS-CoV-2 viremia has been established in different tissues that widely express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors [28]. The reactivation of dormant viruses such as EBV and HHV-6 due to immune dysregulation and the activation of the interferon cascade, induction of the NLRP3 inflammasome, increased oxidative damage and lowered antioxidant defenses (the glutathione system and zinc), infection, neuro-inflammation including the brainstem, molecular mimicry and autoimmunity, and, of course, underlying genetic predisposition have been hypothesized as potential triggers of long COVID [27,29,30,31].",
            "There are other factors and certain comorbidities, such as pre-existing diabetes mellitus, obesity, lung disease and microvascular dysregulation, that contribute to long COVID. Major contributors are shown in Figure 1 and will be discussed in this manuscript.",
            "Any potential discoveries regarding the pathophysiologic mechanisms for long COVID will increase opportunities for our understanding of the disease and the development of treatments for improved outcome [25]. Currently, it is hypothesized that long COVID could occur through five mechanisms: (1) Viral persistence; (2) Reactivation of latent viruses; (3) Viral superantigen activation of the immune system; (4) Disturbance in the gut microbiome; and (5) Multiple tissue damage and autoimmunity. These mechanisms are summarized in Figure 2 and discussed below.",
            "There are other lesser-known factors that may also be associated with long COVID. One such is the impact of nitro-oxidative stress, which was studied by Al-Hakeim et al. [32]. The team examined the effects of peripheral oxygen saturation and peak body temperature on the immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress pathways and neuropsychiatric symptoms of long COVID. Their results suggest that post-viral somatic and mental symptoms of the disease may have a neuroimmune and neuro-oxidative origin [32].",
            "First, how does the SARS-CoV-2 virus infect a host?",
            "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 receptor is the protein that provides the entry point for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter human cells. They are present in the respiratory system, vascular endothelium, heart, brain, GI tract, kidney, liver, spleen and pancreas [30]. After binding to the ACE2 receptor, SARS-CoV-2 uses three important steps to establish itself all over the body (see Figure 3):Infection—Once bound to the receptor, the virus delivers its viral nucleic acid into the healthy cell.Replication—The viral nucleic acid duplicates inside the cell, and the cell’s resources are used to form more viruses around the nucleic acid. The now-infected cell releases these newly formed viruses.Spread—The newly formed viruses now go on to attack other cells all throughout the body, and the process repeats over and over.",

            "Replication—The viral nucleic acid duplicates inside the cell, and the cell’s resources are used to form more viruses around the nucleic acid. The now-infected cell releases these newly formed viruses.",
            "Spread—The newly formed viruses now go on to attack other cells all throughout the body, and the process repeats over and over.",
            "Depending on the strength of the host’s immune system, the spreading of this virus may induce mild symptoms or induce life-threatening disease [30].",
            "Under certain conditions, a viral invader may not be completely eliminated by the host’s immune system. The cessation of symptoms, non-detection of viral presence, and the development of immunity after infection does not necessarily mean that the virus has been completely eradicated from the host [33]. Some viruses or their parts may remain and hide in tissues and can be reactivated later. This is viral persistence [34,35,36].",
            "Some viral pathogens have the capability to avoid recognition and thus avoid activation of the proper immune response [36].",
            "The viral RNA may survive elimination and hide in tissue reservoirs, waiting for reactivation, replication and spread [35].",
            "The idea that viral persistence might be responsible for long COVID came from various studies from different parts of the world that found viral RNA or viral antigens in the blood, feces and different tissue biopsies from 3 to several months after the initial diagnosis of COVID-19 [37,38,39,40,41].",
            "Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and superantigens (SAgs) released by the virus which are known to induce polyclonal activation of T cells and cytokine storm could also induce both apoptosis of cellular components and direct activation of dendritic cells, which could lead to the autoimmunity associated with long COVID [42]. Because the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 and its remnants in the tissue results in immune response to the virus, the measurement of IgG and IgM antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleoprotein is recommended.",
            "Studies have associated the reactivation of opportunistic viral infections such as EBV, HHV-6 and CMV with the severity and length of COVID-19 symptoms [43,44]. As previously shown, viruses or their parts may under certain conditions survive the defensive response of the immune system and hide in tissue reservoirs. These latent viruses may then be reactivated, and this reactivation facilitates the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells, enhancing viral load and severity of symptoms.",
            "EBV and HHV-6 are the most common immunotropic viruses which use latency after infection to hide from the immune system [44]. EBV has infected more than 90% of the world’s population and more than 95% of healthy adults [45]. Most infected individuals are asymptomatic if they contract it in early childhood. However, patients who contract it during adolescence or adulthood will suffer the symptoms of mononucleosis. Upon the reactivation of EBV, the clinical manifestations include fatigue, brain fog, sleep disturbance, arthralgia, myalgia, pharyngitis, headache, fever, gastrointestinal upset, and skin rashes. Subsequent to the primary bout of infection, the virus enters a state of latency within the B cells to avoid immune surveillance [46,47].",
            "HHV-6 is the collective name for the double-stranded DNA viruses HHV-6A and HHV-6B. More than 90% of humans are infected with HHV-6B within the first three years of life [46]. Those infected with HHV-6 present symptoms that include fatigue, persistent oropharyngitis, recurrent lymphadenopathy, abdominal complaints, and thyroid dysfunction. Sufferers under 3 often develop a skin rash known as roseola. After the primary infection, the HHV-6 virus enters its own latency period, hiding within monocytes, macrophages and the salivary glands [48].",
            "EBV and HHV-6 gain entry into the host cells, particularly B cells, through the oropharyngial epithelium, where they establish latent infection. In the B cell, the viruses undergo intermittent lytic reactivation and replication in epithelial cells, thereby producing infectious virions that are shed in the saliva [49,50]. Because EBV and HHV-6 replicate in the oropharyngial and nasopharyngial epithelium, which is the site of infection for SARS-CoV-2, the subclinical reactivation of EBV and HHV-6 may affect the degree or severity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection [43,51].",
            "The correlation between EBV reactivation and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection/symptoms have been confirmed by several studies from all over the world. In order for EBV reactivation to be determined clinically, serological testing for the presence of EBV early antigen-diffuse (EA-D) IgG or EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) was performed. A study by Simmonet et al. [43] found that in samples from 34 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe COVID-19 infection, EBV DNA was detected at least once in 28 patients (82.4%). In 19 (67.8%) out of these 28 patients, the amount of DNA was quantifiable with a median viral load of 8648 IU/mL. These patients experienced a longer median ICU stay (15 days) in comparison to those without EBV activation (8 days). The median time for ICU admission of these patients was 4 days following infection, with median time for EBV DNA detection at 7 days following infection. In 22% of the patients, HHV-6 DNA was detected but with viral load being unquantifiable in 6/7 patients. HHV-6 was not linked to a longer ICU stay or a higher simplified acute physiology score (SAPS). Lastly, four (12%) of the total 34 patients presented with a co-occurrence of HHV-6 infection/reactivation [43].",
            "In another study [52], Paolucci et al. used similar methods on a cohort of 104 patients. Overall, 42 of the patients were admitted to the ICU, while the remaining 62 were admitted to the sub-intensive care unit (SICU). All patients but one were positive for EBV IgG (99%). EBV DNA was detected in 40/42 (95.2%) of the ICU patients and 51/61 (83.6%) of the SICU patients. The median level of EBV DNA for ICU patients was 4709 IU/mL, which was significantly higher than the median for SICU patients. Significant reductions in natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells were detected only in patients with the reactivation of EBV but not in those with CMV or parvovirus B19 infections [52].",
            "Just as the previously mentioned studies sought to draw a connection between COVID-19 and viral infections, Gold et al. also attempted to associate EBV reactivation with the extended version of the disease called long COVID in a case study on a cohort of 185 patients [53]. Of the 185, 56 (30.3%) reported long COVID symptoms. Thirty patients were enrolled in a long-term study (90 days and more after COVID-19 diagnosis), and 20/30 (66.7%) tested positive for EBV reactivation as opposed to 2/20 (10%) for the control group. Nine patients were enrolled in a short-term study (21–90 days post-COVID-19 diagnosis), and 7/9 (77.8%) tested positive for EBV reactivation, as opposed to 1/9(11.1%) for the control group. It is noteworthy that only patients positive for EBV EA-D had significant presentations of a number of long COVID symptoms, with the most common being fatigue, insomnia, headaches, myalgia, and confusion [53].",
            "A recent study by Zubchenko et al. came up with very similar results [44]. Among 88 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 68 (72.3%) tested positive for the reactivation of herpesviruses (EBV, HHV-6, CMV), leaving 20 (27.7%) of the patients without detectable DNA as the control group. Patients with post-COVID symptoms showed a reactivation of EBV in 42.6%, HHV-6 in 25.0%, and reactivation of both EBV and HHV-6 in 32.4%. The 68 patients who were positive for reactivation were more likely to need more intensive care and have a longer median stay in the hospital, 16 days as opposed to 7 days for controls, which was statistically significant. Furthermore, the 68 reactivated patients were more likely to experience elevated ESR, CRP, D-dimer, lymphopenia, monocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST) [44].",
            "The reactivation of opportunistic viral infections such as EBV, HHV-6 and CMV is common in ICU patients with no previous immune suppression. This reactivation possibly facilitates the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells, enhancing the viral load and severity of symptoms, as described by previous studies. While studies regarding the mechanism and true effects of HHV-6 reactivation on long COVID are currently limited, there is clearly a strong correlation between the severity/length of COVID-related symptoms and the reactivation of EBV [14,15,16,17,43,44,53].",
            "Many different reports have discussed the similarity in symptoms and test results of patients with long COVID and patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases, especially lupus and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In fact, in patients with RA, anti-EBV antibody response has been found to be strong, leading to the conclusion that the measurement of EBV antibodies might be considered in RA patients as an aid in the diagnosis and the formation of treatment protocols [54,55,56]. Zubchenko et al. concluded that because patients suffering from long COVID who have shown evidence of EBV and HHV-6 have a higher risk of developing various pathologies, including autoimmune disease, such patients should therefore be examined for EBV and HHV-6 reactivation by measuring IgG and IgM antibodies against viral capsid, nuclear, and early antigen [39].",
            "In search of the mechanism by which EBV may enhance or contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infection, Verma et al. [51] found that EBV lytic replication induces ACE2 expression on epithelial cells, facilitating the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the cells. Additionally, this study found that the ACE2 promoter enhances Z transcriptional activator (Zta) response. Zta promotes the reactivation of the latent EBV virus and the replication of lytic phase EBV. Furthermore, Zta has been found to preferentially act on methylated ACE2 promoters, enabling it to reactivate silenced EBV promoters from their latent state [57,58]. This leads us to believe that EBV infection/reactivation enhances the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell. The two viruses therefore work hand-in-hand in promoting more severe and prolonged symptoms of COVID-19.",
            "Whether or not synergism between EBV and HHV-6 further contributes towards ACE2 expression and facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into the epithelial cell requires further investigation. We hypothesized that similarly to EBV, the subclinical reactivation of HHV-6 gene expression may enhance the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 binding to the ACE receptor on human epithelial cells. We propose that in this way EBV, HHV-6 and perhaps other viruses can facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell. This may be followed by viral replication and the spreading of the virus into the adjacent tissues (see Figure 4). The involvement of HHV-6 in the enhancement of SARS-CoV-2’s entry into epithelial cells should be investigated in future studies. The possibility presented above that two or more viruses (EBV, HHV-6, etc.) may synergistically act as drivers of immunological changes in patients with ME/CFS was previously discussed by Williams et al. [59].",
            "Deoxyuridine triphopsphate nucleotidohydrolases (dUTPases) are metalloenzymes that constitute a new family of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are produced by herpesviruses during abortive or productive replication, contributing to pathophysiological changes in herpesvirus-associated diseases [59]. EBV-dUTPase is expressed during the productive replication of the virus as an early BLLF3 gene product and is released in exosomes from the infected and/or stressed cells through a very inflammatory form of cell death called pyroptosis [60,61,62]. After the initial EBV lytic infection, the EBV persists in latent form in an individual’s memory B cell; the reactivation of EBV in the B cell may result in the exosomal release of dUTPase, which may be transmitted to the host’s cells or tissues where it may modulate the cellular microenvironment, thus contributing to the pathophysiological mechanism of EBV-associated disorders [63].",
            "As mentioned earlier, pathogens encode for various PAMPs that are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which act as immune sensors on immune cells. Among PRRs are Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are responsible for the primary recognition of a variety of pathogens. This leads to the initiation of innate and adaptive immune reactions against many pathogens, including EBV and HHV-6 [64,65,66].",
            "TLR2 is a type of receptor that is localized on the surface of immune cells and can form complexes with TLR1 or TLR6. A significant binding affinity exists between viral dUTPases (PAMPs) and TLR2. Although TLR2 is part of the innate immune response and is vital for the defense against viruses, its activation has been shown to be involved in various autoimmune diseases, including RA, Sjögren’s syndrome, MS, systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [67]. This is because once engaged, TLR2 activates a signaling cascade that results in the production of proinflammatory cytokines that contribute to the development and progression of many disorders [68,69,70]. For example, Ariza et al. demonstrated that through the engagement of the TLR2 homodimer, EBV-dUTPase induces the activation of NF-κB, which is a very strong proinflammatory mediator [71,72]. Interestingly, HSV-2 and HHV-6A dUTPases also activated NF-κB after ligation with TKR2/1 heterodimer [68,69]. Furthermore Ariza et al. showed that EBV, HHV-6 and other viral dUTPases are capable of activating different lymphocyte subpopulations and inducing the production of T-helper-1 (Th1), T-helper-17 (Th17), and other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α [71,72,73].",
            "It is interesting to note that EBV and HHV-6 dUTPases have differences in their abilities to induce cytokine secretion and NF-κB activation, which may be a reflection of the differences of their molecular sizes, amino acid sequences, and their binding affinities to TLR2 or other TLRs [68,69,70]. For example, the degree of identity between EBV and HHV-6 A and B dUTPases was shown to be 21%, but with HHV-8 dUTPase, it was 31% [59]. This protein homology between EBV and HHV-6 dUTPases may be the reason that about 20% of ME/CSF patients co-expressed antibodies against EBV and HHV-6 dUTPases, and 28.41% produced antibodies against EBV, HHV-6, and human dUTPases [74]. These results indicate that the reactivation of multiple herpesviruses (EBV, HHV-6) and their production of dUTPase can elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses, including the hyperactivation of Th1 and Th17 in some patients with ME/CSF [71,72,73]. It is entirely possible that this also applies to patients with long COVID, because many of the symptoms and conditions observed in long COVID are also shared by patients with ME/CSF [75,76].",
            "The exposome is a person’s lifetime exposure to internal and external factors [6,77]. It may cause the reactivation of multiple herpesviruses (EBV, HHV-6), causing the release of their different dUTPases. These may in turn affect the different components of both the humoral and cell-mediated immune system, possibly causing deficiencies, abnormalities or dysfunctions that may result in long COVID or ME/CFS in some patients. The mechanism for this is shown in Figure 5.",
            "Because the release of dUTPase by both EBV and HHV-6 results in immune reaction and the production of antibodies, measurements of IgG and IgM antibodies against these viral antigens should be investigated.",
            "Superantigens (SAgs) are a class of antigens that are produced by some pathogenic viruses and bacteria as a defense mechanism against the immune system. Because they cause the non-specific activation of T-cells, they induce polyclonal T cell activation and massive cytokine release, resulting in excessive activation of the immune system, which may lead to autoimmunity, multiple organ failure, and even death [78]. They are known to elicit a very strong immune response and the release of proinflammatory cytokines by activated T cells through the cross-linking of receptors on those T cells with MHC class II molecules [79,80]. Some SAgs can also hyper-stimulate B cells into producing heightened levels of antibodies [78].",
            "In relation to SAgs and SARS-CoV-2, in a very recent perspective by Hamdy and Leonardi [78], it was shown that SARS-CoV-2 contains a very unique superantigen-like peptide not found in any other SARS virus. This SARS-CoV-2 (671–692) SAg-like motif is shown below:CASYQTQT_NSPRRARSVASQSI",
            "However, in their conclusion, it is stated that “It is of vital importance to definitively establish whether SARS-CoV-2 is a superantigen, superantigen-like, or triggers a superantigenic host response in order to better understand the short and long-term consequences of infection” [78]. The reason for this classification is the identification of the SAg motif close to the SARS-CoV-2 S1-S2 cleavage site of spike protein with a similar sequence to Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB), which is known as a classical SAg [79].",
            "To further support this homology between the SARS-CoV-2 SAg motif of S protein and SEB, monoclonal antibodies were screened for their ability to bind to this motif. The SEB monoclonal antibody not only bound to the SAg motif on the S protein but was capable of inhibiting infection with live SARS-CoV-2 [79]. Furthermore, Cheng et al. [79] showed that this superantigenic character of a unique insert to SARS-CoV-2 exhibited a high affinity for binding to the T cell receptor (TCR) that may form a complex with MHC class II. The binding of this SAg to the TCR may trigger the cytotoxic adaptive immune responses observed in multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) as well as cytokine storm in adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [79].",
            "Molecular chaperones such as heat shock proteins (HSPs) are another group of proteins which share epitopes with SARS-COV-2 that potentially are capable of eliciting autoimmunity [81]. HSP proteins, which make up approximately 5–10% the total proteins in most cells, are categorized based on their molecular weights. HSP10 and HSP21 are classified as small, HSP60, HSP65 and HSP70 are known as medium, and HSP90 and HSP100 are classified as large [82]. Overall, the main role of HSPs is the protection of cellular components against stressors by maintaining the correct folding of newly synthesized proteins, participating in the repair of misfolded proteins, and transporting proteins to their site of action [83]. In the absence of stressors, HSPs are associated with a specific factor called heat shock factor (HSF). However, cellular stress and an increase in protein damage results in the release of HSP from the HSF complex in order to bind to damaged proteins. The free HSF in cells manage to bind to heat shock DNA elements, resulting in HSP expression, which is called heat shock response or HSR [82,83].",
            "Viruses in general lack classical HSPs, so they use their hosts’ HSPs to fold their proteins, which contributes to the effectiveness of viral infection. The HSPs also support viruses by forming complexes on the cell surface to enhance the viruses’ entry into the host cells. Furthermore, they interact with viral polymerases to support viral replication [82]. Finally, it has been shown that HSPs share a significant homology with SARS-CoV-2 antigenic epitopes, which could generate immunological cross-reactivity in COVID-19 that might be the cause of autoimmunity [81]. HSP60, HSP65, HSP70 and HSP90 are four major proteins that share homology not only with other human proteins but also with many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 [64,78,79]. The immunological relevance of this peptide sharing between human HSPs and SARS-CoV-2 proteins is shown in Table 1.",
            "Through different mechanisms, both the viral and the host’s superantigens seem to contribute to persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection that may result in long COVID. By the over-stimulation of immune responses, the HSP-like molecules and other superantigens of the virus induce a negative feedback loop that allows SARS-CoV-2 to persist in the tissue. Normally, the presence of host factors would induce the activation of the innate and adaptive components of the immune system, resulting in a biased T-helper cell response that would influence fast recovery from viral infection [84]. However, THR cell imbalance following infection with the virus, particularly the over-activation of Th1 and Th17, could contribute toward long COVID. This provides justification for using a patient’s lymphocyte map results to design treatment modalities. This emphasis on the Th cell status of patients with viral infection may prove to be the most effective strategy for the treatment of patients with long COVID. Furthermore, the innate and adaptive immune responses against viral superantigens result in high levels of antibodies against them, which is why further investigation of the possible roles for these viral superantigens in long COVID is warranted.",
            "A microbiome is a community or collection of microorganisms that co-inhabit a particular environment such as the human body or a part thereof. These microbes include bacteria, bacteriophages, protozoa, fungi, viruses and helminths [85]. Largely unnoticed and outwardly invisible, these living organisms co-exist in a stable relationship within a healthy human body and clearly exert considerable influence on all aspects of our physiology. However, as mankind has evolved, so, too, has the microbiome. The microbiome of twenty-first century man is vastly different from that of his forebears, because the food, living conditions and daily experiences of modern man have been changed by literal millennia from that of primitive man [86].",
            "The transition from living in the wild to communal urban living, continuing technical progress, industrialization, and modernization throughout the ages have brought about lifestyle changes such as increases in hygiene and sanitation, antibiotics and the consumption of processed foods. All this has unavoidably affected the composition of our bodies’ microbiomes [87].",
            "We know that environmental factors can induce autoimmune responses and can interact with the diverse teeming occupants of our microbiome. We can readily understand, then, that in genetically predisposed or susceptible individuals, dysbiosis or disturbances in the gut, oral and skin microbiomes have been linked to damage to the tissues and actual autoimmunity. This is because alterations in the microbial composition of a microbiome induce inflammation and a failure in immune tolerance, and they could ultimately contribute significantly toward autoimmunity. Gut microbial changes such as this are the hallmark of COVID-19, particularly long COVID [48,87,88,89,90].",
            "In relation to microbiome changes in COVID-19, Dotan et al. in 2022 published a review article [91] in which they described “COVID-19 as an infectome paradigm of autoimmunity.” They concluded that the reviewed evidence showed that the microbiome, particularly the gut and lung microbiome, may have a pivotal role in the pathogenesis, clinical severity, outcome, and possibly even treatment of COVID-19.",
            "Wang et al. focused on the oral, gut, and lung microbiomes when they reviewed the microbial characteristics of COVID-19 [92]. They found that in comparison to that of healthy subjects, the microbial composition of COVID-19 patients was significantly changed, especially the microbiota of the gut and lungs. This suggests that these microbiota may be useful as biomarkers for COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",
            "Yeoh et al. made some interesting findings regarding gut dysbiosis when they compared the gut microbiomes of COVID-19 patients with those of healthy controls [93]. They found that the feces of COVID-19 patients had a lower number of Roseburia, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium and Lanchnospiraceae, which are known as anti-inflammatory bacteria, but they were enriched with Enterococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridium hathewayi, Bacterius nordii and Actinomyces viscosus, which are known to cause bacteremia. This sort of fungal gut microbiome has been observed in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 [94,95]. This indicates that the dysbiosis of gut fungi may contribute to fungal infection in COVID-19 patients. There is substantial evidence that the perturbance of these microbiota is associated with the induction and disease severity of long COVID or post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) [91,96,97,98,99].",
            "In a recent study [96], Liu et al. provided observational evidence of gut dysbiosis in patients with long-term sequelae after COVID-19 infection. For their study, the researchers analyzed a serial fecal microbiome of 258 samples using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. They then correlated the patients’ gut microbiota changes with persistent symptoms at 6 months. Based on the results, they first showed that the gut microbiota composition at the time of hospital admission was associated with the occurrence of long COVID. Secondly, they found that the gut microbiome profile at 6 months of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection but without long COVID was comparable to those of controls who had not contracted COVID-19. Thirdly, they demonstrated that the gut microbiome of patients with long COVID was characterized by higher numbers of Bacteroides vulgatus, Ruminococcus gnavus, Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum, Actinomyces johnsonii, Atopobium parvulum and Clostridium innocuum that positively correlated with long COVID.",
            "Moreover, patients without long COVID had gut bacterial compositions that were enriched for 19 bacteria, characterized by Bifidobacterium, Brautia and Bacteroidetes. At 6 months, 13 bacterial species including Blautia wexlerae and Bifidobacterium longum were negatively associated with long COVID. This indicates that these species may have protective roles during recovery from COVID-19. A summary of this dichotomy of these two positively or negatively associated groups noted by Liu et al. [96] and reviewed by Wang et al. [92] is shown in Figure 6.",
            "Because disturbance in the gut microbiota has been associated with the activation of monocytes and neutrophils, the production of S100A12, damage to the tight junction and the induction of leaky gut, measurements of microbiome RNA, DNA, direct stool culture, zonulin, zonulin antibody, IgG/IgM/IgA antibodies against various bacterial toxins should be investigated in long COVID patients.",
            "These discoveries strongly suggest that the modulation of gut microbiota by the use of medication, microbial transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, engineered symbiotic bacteria, gut commensal-derived metabolites, amino acid derivatives, carbohydrates, vitamins, polysaccharides, glycolipids and more could facilitate faster recovery from COVID-19 and reduce the risk of long COVID development [92,96].",
            "Autoimmune diseases can be recognized and classified by certain characteristics, such as the presence of detectable autoantibodies. The disruption of the immune system and breakdown in immune tolerance can result not only in long-term inflammatory reactions but malfunction and actual damage to organs that fall victim to mistaken immune responses [100].",
            "The potential role of autoimmunity in the induction of long COVID was discussed in the earlier sections in the context of viral persistence, reactivation of herpesviruses (especially EBV and HHV-6), viral superantigens, and gut microbiota. We see that different mechanisms including molecular mimicry between components of viral antigens and various human tissue antigens can lead to the immune system becoming chronically activated, thus inducing autoimmune responses [101,102,103,104]. One such antigen that shares structural similarity with SARS-CoV-2 and herpesviruses is neuronal protein [83,84,86]. It has been found that both COVID-19 and long COVID share the presence of certain autoantibodies with a form of autonomic dysregulation called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) [100,105]. These autoantibodies are known to attack G-protein-coupled receptors on neurons [106]. Many pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, contain superantigens that are capable of activating T and B cells in a non-specific manner, producing a variety of autoantibodies in patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome and patients with acute COVID-19 [107,108]. Finally, the reactivation of herpesviruses, particularly EBV and HHV-6 [29,30] that not only share a significant homology with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [4,103] but co-infection with these viruses may change the structure of the ACE2 receptor on the epithelial cell in such a way that SARS-CoV-2 will complete its infective cycle much more efficiently (see Figure 4). In fact, in a subgroup of patients with long COVID, very high levels of antibodies against EBV and HHV-6 were reported [44]. This may be why some clinical features of moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection are mimics of those seen in lupus, inflammatory arthritis, anti-phospholipid syndrome, and other autoimmune diseases [109,110,111,112,113,114]. Moreover, there are many reports of patients who, following infection with SARS-CoV-2, developed classical autoimmune diseases such as cardiomyopathy, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, systemic Guillain–Barré syndrome, thyroid autoimmunity, sclerosis and more [115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125].",
            "These autoimmune conditions that followed SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified based largely on specific autoantibodies that were detected in the blood of the patients. Although more research is still emerging, many researchers believe that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to new potentially pathogenic antibodies that may attack host tissues and cause harm [114,115,116,117,118,122,123,124,125]. These autoantibodies may enhance different symptomatologies that are increasingly observed in long COVID patients [103]. The possible contributions to long COVID may stem not only from mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 and a variety of tissue antigens [91,103] but also from the reactivation of latent viruses such as EBV and HHV-6 in COVID-19 patients and their synergistic effects in the development of autoimmunities.",
            "These three viruses are rapidly becoming strongly associated with autoimmunity. However, due to its many connections and contributions to autoimmune diseases, and, of course, its glaring presence in the public eye, extra focus has particularly been brought to bear on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Ever since the outbreak of COVID-19, more and more evidence continues to be gathered about SARS-CoV-2’s associations with autoimmunity and immune dysregulation [102,103,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136]. In a subgroup of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the detection of certain autoantibodies and circulating inflammatory mediators correlate with the report of symptoms related to autoimmunity and inflammation in individuals presumed to be genetically pre-disposed [102,103,126,127,137,138,139,140].",
            "The following previously published key points [102,103,131] that were also presented by the corresponding author at the 13th International Congress of Autoimmunity [141] support the concept of SARS-CoV-2 being one of the autoimmune viruses:SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and nucleoproteins share molecular mimicry with human autoantigens involved with autoimmune diseases;Both animal and human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) made against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and nucleoproteins react with human autoantigens;Antibodies made against human autoantigens react with SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and nucleoproteins;The sera of patients with COVID-19 have tested positive for autoantibodies made against human autoantigens known to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and nucleoproteins share molecular mimicry with human autoantigens involved with autoimmune diseases;",
            "Both animal and human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) made against SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and nucleoproteins react with human autoantigens;",
            "Antibodies made against human autoantigens react with SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and nucleoproteins;",
            "The sera of patients with COVID-19 have tested positive for autoantibodies made against human autoantigens known to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2.",
            "These four key points are the best experimental evidence that was generated in our lab for SARS-CoV-2 being one of the “autoimmune viruses” [102,103,131].",
            "Evidence continues to mount linking the development of different autoimmune disorders to herpesvirus infections (see Figure 7). It has been shown, for example, that the pathogenesis of systemic autoimmune diseases (SADs) can be triggered by the reactivation of latent herpesviruses [142,143,144,145]. In the case of SADs, attention is especially being focused on EBV infection as playing an important role in their pathogenesis.",
            "Researchers have found increased EBV viral mRNA expression and elevated viral loads of EBV DNA in the blood of SLE patients [146,147,148]. Abnormal cell-mediated immunity, increased EBV viral load, and high levels of EBV antibodies have also been demonstrated in patients with RA and Sjögren’s syndrome [145,149].",
            "EBV can also lead to autoimmunity through molecular mimicry when autoantigens associated with lupus in SLE patients cross-react with antibodies produced against EBNA-1. The resultant epitope spreading could cause this cross-reactivity to expand to even more autoantigens [150]. TLR3 signaling is another way in which EBV infection can induce the activation of innate immunity, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and interferon [151]. Further evidence for EBV reactivation as an environmental trigger of autoimmunity is provided by the serological detection of IgG early antigen antibodies in individuals with established lupus that correlate not only with transition to SLE but also with severity of the disease [152,153]. Additionally, antibodies made against EBV nuclear antigen cross-react with human Sm and Ro that are known to be lupus-associated antigens, and they correlate with these lupus-associated autoantibodies [153,154,155,156,157,158,159]. Interestingly, due to viral reactivation, the same EBV antibodies that were detected in SADs were shown to be elevated in long COVID patients [26,43,44,51,53]. Thus, EBV and other herpesviruses, such as HHV-6, could be the common denominators between long COVID and autoimmunity.",
            "HHV-6 is another member of the herpesvirus family that is believed to play a major role in the induction of autoimmunity. Like EBV, it also has the capacity to sometimes escape elimination, lie low, and wake like a sleeper cell for reactivation. By carrying stretches of telomeric repeats at their linear genome, the variants HHV-6A and HHV-6B are able to integrate into human chromosomes and become latent [160]. This virus has been found in several human diseases, including autoimmunity [161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189], ME/CFS [190,191,192,193], mitochondrial dysfunction [193,194], and in patients with moderate to critical COVID-19 [42,43,44,195,196]. Among the autoimmune diseases associated with HHV-6, the most frequently cited is multiple sclerosis (MS) [170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184]. This has been demonstrated by the direct detection of the HHV-6 genome and antigens in the blood and brain of patients with MS [176,177,178,181,182,183]. Furthermore, not only were higher levels of anti-HHV-6 A/B antibodies detected in the blood of MS patients, their titers also correlated with the severity of the disease [170] and in predicting risk of relapse [184,185,186]. Researchers further concluded that in addition to its potential etiologic role in MS, infection with HHV-6 or immune reaction against it may also have an effect on MS relapse and its progression [184]. Because this observed clinical effect is directly related to anti-HHV-6 antibody titer, the measurement of antibodies to HHV-6 antigens may be a useful prognostic factor in the clinical course of MS [184]. In addition, several reports have provided important data connecting HHV-6 A/B with other autoimmune diseases, including RA [156], collagen vascular disease [162], lupus [163], connective tissue disease [164,165], Sjögren’s syndrome [166], systemic sclerosis [167], thyroid autoimmunity [168,169], severe and acute autoimmune hepatitis [187], autoimmune hemolytic anemia [188], and autoimmune neutropenia [189]. Moreover, in a recent study, Bigley et al. [197] observed that adult mice infected with murine roseolovirus (MRV), which acts like HHV-6 and HHV-7 during the neonatal phase, developed autoimmune gastritis (AIG). It is notable that this autoimmune phenomenon developed months after resolution of acute viral infection. In search of the mechanism, the researchers found that there had been a breakdown in the central tolerance that was dependent on CD4+ T cells and IL-17-producing cells, resulting in an attack on the stomach tissue, and, thus, the development of autoimmune disease [197]. This induction of autoimmunity by MRV was accompanied by the production of autoantibodies against antigens, some of which are typically associated with AIG, and some which are not: anti-H+/K+ ATPase (typically detected in AIG) and other autoantibodies such as thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase, insulin, double-stranded DNA, topoisomerase 1, glomerular basement membrane, and myoloperoxidase, which are detected in many autoimmune diseases. Based on this and other data, Bigley et al. concluded that the murine equivalent of human HHV-6 and HHV-7 induced a significant breakdown in the central tolerance mechanism that resulted in the production of antibodies against a widespread variety of autoantigens that are detected mainly in polyautoimmunity [197]. These findings about the presence of so many autoantibodies in the blood of mice infected with MRV may explain the involvement of HHV-6 in many autoimmune disorders (shown in Figure 8) through a completely new mechanism which involves the disruption of central tolerance [197].",
            "Although it is already very well-known how viruses, including HHV-6, through molecular mimicry, bystander activation, epitope spreading, and activation of autoreactive Th1 and Th17 cells induce various autoimmune diseases [162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189], the breakdown of thymic central tolerance by viruses such as HHV-6 and HHV-7 is a novel one.",
            "Altogether, we may conclude that the reactivation of latent EBV, HHV-6 and possibly other viruses may act synergistically with SARS-CoV-2 to pre-dispose a patient toward autoimmunity, which is a hallmark of long COVID or post-COVID syndrome. In support of this hypothesis, very recently, Rojas et al. [198] demonstrated that latent autoimmunity was detected in 83% and polyautoimmunity in 62% of patients with post-COVID syndrome.",
            "The awareness of the association connecting herpesviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and long COVID creates new opportunities for the diagnosis, management, and possible treatment of this new disease [53].",
            "Thus, in addition to measuring IgG and IgM antibodies against reactivated latent viruses such as EBV, HHV-6, CMV, heat shock proteins and other viral superantigens, it is highly recommended the measurement of antibodies against type 1 interferon, S100A12, ANA, ENA, dsDNA, RF, actin, mitochondrial antibodies, C1Q immune complexes and other antigens in the blood of patients with long COVID should also be investigated.",
            "Furthermore, aside from the aforementioned autoantibodies, the possible contribution to long COVID of autoreactive T cells warrants their scrutiny, especially the relationship and balance/imbalance between Th1/Th17 and regulatory T cells. Thus, the determination of the composition of the lymphocyte subpopulation by flow cytometry may shed light on the pathophysiological changes in a subset of patients with long COVID 9 [199].",
            "Currently, there are several medications for targeting SARS-CoV-2 directly. These include Paxlovid (Pfizer, New York, NY, USA), Lagevrio (Merck, Rahway, NJ, USA), Remdesivir, Ivermectin, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, and Bebtelovimab.",
            "Zinc plus low-dose hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was suggested by Derwand et al. [200] for COVID-19 outpatients.",
            "Since 2020, Ivermectin had been suggested or even used in many countries as a potential chemoprophylaxis against COVID-19 [201]. It has also been shown very recently as an effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2 through its feeding of Bifidobacterium and increasing its number. On the one hand, this increase in bacterial levels boosts natural immunity; on the other hand, it reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines, but this is actually also a benefit, since these cytokines contribute toward a cytokine storm, so that Ivermectin has two ways to protect against COVID-19 [202].",
            "Moreover, the use of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in COVID-19 and viral infections in general has been shown to suppress NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activity. This nicotinamide seems to contribute to the resolution of inflammation, limiting the effects of cytokine storms observed in COVID-19 and possibly other viral infectious diseases [203].",
            "In relation to targeting microbiota disturbance for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, there are many immunomodulatory options that are briefly discussed in this manuscript [96]. This includes dietary intervention, prebiotics, probiotics, short-chain fatty acids (acetate, butyrate, propionate) that are produced by gut microbiota after feeding on fibers, AHR blockers, vitamins A and D (these bind to receptors on CD4+CD25+ cells with a capacity to regulate the immune system in the gut and beyond), and potential nutritional and antioxidant supplements. The use of polyphenols, probiotics, vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids was suggested by Daoust et al. [204]. Fecal transplant, microbiota transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, microbiome-derived metabolites, and engineered symbiotic bacteria as treatment options that could modulate host microbiota and mitigate virus-induced inflammation in the gut have been suggested by different studies [205,206,207,208].",
            "KB109 is a synthetic glycan that helps to support the homeostasis of the immune system through microbiome modulation in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. In COVID patients with comorbidities, this product reduced medically attended acute care visits and shortened symptoms [209].",
            "In addition to SARS-CoV-2′s alteration of gut microbiota, the enrichment of opportunistic pathogens and depletion of beneficial commensals which produce SCFA, SARS-CoV-2 also invades enterocytes via ACE2, which may cause disturbance of the gut microbiota and leaky gut syndrome [102]. Although ACE2 is known as a maintainer of the balance of the renin–angiotensin system, it is also a key regulator of innate immunity, microbial balance, and dietary amino acid homeostasis [210]. During a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus invades the gut by binding to ACE2, and it undergoes replication to promote and spread the viral infection [211,212]. This reduction in ACE2 by the virus leads to the accumulation of angiotensin II, the ligand for ACE2, resulting in the overproduction of endotoxins which contributes to enhanced intestinal permeability to macromolecules, and, thus, to leaky gut [213]. This impairment of barrier function and the entry of lipopolysaccharides into the systemic circulation may contribute to hyperactivation of the immune system and an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines that activate the inflammatory cascade.",
            "Beneficial effects against COVID-19 and long COVID can even come from very ordinary, commonplace things. In a 2022 review, Foolchand et al. state that vitamin D and its receptor not only fight viral infection in general, but that they also function to regulate genes involved in immunity, apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation. These immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D suggest a role for it in the treatment of COVID-19 [214]. Even a seemingly ordinary practice such as dieting or fasting may have a great beneficial effect for immunity against COVID-19. Fasting causes the synthesis in the liver of the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). BHB is a multifunctional molecule that not only provides energy fuel but also exerts direct effects on immune cells [215]. Karagiannis et al. compared peripheral blood from patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by SARS-CoV-2, influenza or bacterial respiratory infections, and found that patients with COVID-19 had substantially lower serum concentrations of BHB, indicating dysregulated ketogenesis [215]. They also observed that BHB supplementation increased cell numbers and enhanced IFN-γ production in human and mouse Th1 cells under amino acid-deficient conditions in vitro. The oral administration of ketone esters improved antiviral CD4+ T cell functional fitness and viral clearance, resulting in benefits that included improved overall survival. This research suggests that BHB is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of severe COVID-19 and provides new insights and understanding of dietary influence on antiviral immunity against COVID-19 [215].",
            "There have even been attempts to find natural means and treatments to combat COVID-19. Pérez-Vargas et al. sought to explore a novel spectrum of antivirals that would be effective against both existing and the seemingly endlessly evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). They screened a library of natural products (NPs) obtained from plants, fungi, bacteria and marine sponges and achieved promising results, finding that NPs with highly diverse chemical structures have the potential for being developed into SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics [216].",
            "However, it is well known that even in the presence of treatment for SARS-CoV-2, a significant proportion of patients develop many symptoms that persist up to more than 8 months after the initial infection [217]. This is because in addition to SARS-CoV-2, the reactivation of latent viruses such as EBV, HHV-6, CMV and possibly unknown factors are responsible for the development of long COVID in a subgroup of patients [27,43,44,51,53,217]. In fact, Gold et al. concluded that “long COVID symptoms may not be a direct result of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but may be the result of COVID-19-induced EBV reactivation” [53]. Further evidence that EBV and other herpesviruses may be involved in long COVID comes from treatment with ganciclovir; this known anti-herpesvirus medication has the capacity to block EBV replication, and treatment with it reduced the risk of death of severe COVID-19 patients [218]. In addition, there have been attempts to reduce the viral load in the reactivation of herpesviruses by using anti-DNA viral agents. These drugs have shown some measure of efficacy in the management of EBV disease. For instance, the extended administration of valacyclovir has been shown to reduce the frequency of EBV-infected B cells and is being proposed as a protocol for eradicating EBV from a host [219]. EBV VCA synthesis and capsid formation have been found to be inhibited by Spironoloactone in vitro [220]. Its effectiveness has led Spironolactone to being considered as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection itself [221,222].",
            "The medications and treatment protocols for COVID-19 have been rushed through formation and implementation in response to the initial desperate and immediate need, so that they are now fairly well-known and more or less available. In comparison, actual treatments for long COVID are less researched, less known, and less obvious, but they do exist. It is logical to posit that many of the treatments and medications currently being used for the management of COVID-19 have the potential to be used against what is essentially the long-drawn out extended version of the disease known as long COVID. Molnupiravir (Lagevrio) was one of the first oral medications to be approved for treating mild to moderate COVID-19. A recent preclinical study found that molnupiravir attenuated chronic long COVID symptoms [223]. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is also testing several known immunomodulatory drugs, including the monoclonal antibody Infliximab, which is approved for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, for possible use against long COVID [224,225]. Studies show that antihistamines appear to provide relief for long COVID sufferers [226,227].",
            "Treatment is intended to maximize a patient’s functions and improve the quality of life [228]. In the absence of clinical trials, treatment recommendations for long COVID are based on consensus guidelines and the opinions of experts [228,229,230,231,232,233,234,235,236]. A comprehensive treatment protocol must consider a total patient viewpoint that encompasses the patient’s symptomatology, any pre-existing conditions, psychological, social and personal well-being, and the treatment’s specific goals [10,228].",
            "Many of long COVID’s associated symptoms and conditions are already commonly seen in primary care practice and can be treated with established therapeutic protocols and the proper supportive care [228,232,234].",
            "If long COVID has affected the patient to the point of cognitive impairment, a specialist in the appropriate neuro-associated field should be consulted [235].",
            "Monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have been suggested to be used in treatments against both COVID-19 and long COVID. In a small pilot study, researchers found that the CCR5-binding monoclonal antibody leronlimab was able to improve symptoms in some individuals suffering from long COVID apparently by boosting their immunity [237].",
            "The research group of Gil et al. found that patients suffering from long COVID (under the name PASC) with one or more persistent symptoms were associated with physical inactivity. They proposed that their findings may help PASC patients by tailoring treatments to include combating inactivity, with potential overall health benefits [238]. For their part, Scurati et al. found in their own review that exercise is known to exert a deep action on molecular dysfunctions elicited by long COVID-19. Of course, it depends on training, intensity, duration and continuity, but the information they presented bears the consideration of properly regulated exercise as part of the management protocol for long COVID [239]. For patients exhibiting the fatigue or post-exertional malaise characteristic of both long COVID and ME/CSF, a personalized, symptom-guided program for a phased return to activity is recommended [230].",
            "Considering that we have just described a vital role in long COVID for the reactivation of herpesviruses and disturbance of the gut microbiota, targeting SARS-CoV-2 herpesviruses and gut microbiota has been suggested for the prevention and treatment of long COVID. Although many patients may experience the resolution of some or even all of the various symptoms and conditions of long COVID over time, it should be noted that the actual effective treatment and prognosis of the disease is still far from definitive at this point [234]. It is obvious that using therapy that combines all that we have detailed above, anti-viral and pharmacological agents, bacterial transplantation, prebiotics, probiotics, mAbs, and dietary intervention, all these measures that strengthen the immune system can only be of benefit for individuals suffering from long COVID, alleviating the severity of the disease and improving their recovery time [102,240,241,242,243,244,245,246,247,248,249,250].",
            "It is now known that in some individuals, COVID-19 can lead to a long-term disease that has been called many names but is most commonly referred to as long COVID. The many different symptoms and conditions associated with long COVID and their lasting implications and consequences have still to be fully understood, with patients ranging from being asymptomatic to requiring hospitalization and even intensive care [251,252,253,254].",
            "Data show that from 10 to 30% of the hundreds of millions of people who had acute COVID-19 progressed to long COVID, with the CDC reporting that 19% of adults who had COVID-19 are still suffering from symptoms [7,229,237,255].",
            "What causes some patients who suffer from COVID-19 to proceed to long COVID? There are three stages or phases that have been characterized that not all COVID-19 sufferers go through [256]:Phase 1. Acute COVID-19 with varying degrees of severity caused by viral replication and initial immune response. This can last from days to weeks, and asymptomatic patients have also been known to progress to the later phases [256].Phase 2. Two to five weeks after the onset of the infection, a rare hyperinflammatory condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome may occur, with signs and symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease. This is caused by a dysregulated immune response and can affect both children and adults [256,257,258,259].Phase 3. Long COVID may develop and persist for months with varying symptoms [7,10,228,260].",
            "Phase 1. Acute COVID-19 with varying degrees of severity caused by viral replication and initial immune response. This can last from days to weeks, and asymptomatic patients have also been known to progress to the later phases [256].",
            "Phase 2. Two to five weeks after the onset of the infection, a rare hyperinflammatory condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome may occur, with signs and symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease. This is caused by a dysregulated immune response and can affect both children and adults [256,257,258,259].",
            "Phase 3. Long COVID may develop and persist for months with varying symptoms [7,10,228,260].",
            "However, what would make it more likely for a COVID-19 patient to go through all three of these phases into long COVID? The following are some of the risk factors for long COVID as shown by studies: type 2 diabetes mellitus, SARS-CoV-2 viremia, EBV viremia, certain specific autoantibodies, 50+ years in age, female sex, more severe acute infection, more than five symptoms just in the first week of acute infection, immunosuppressive conditions, underlying health conditions (hypertension, obesity, psychiatric condition, etc.), and only partial or no vaccination [261,262,263,264,265,266].",
            "As we have already discussed in this review article, long COVID could be induced by different mechanisms, including viral persistence that leads to chronic activation of the immune system and reactivation of latent viruses, the release of superantigens that over-activate the immune system, alteration in the gut microbiota, and damage to the gut and blood–brain barriers which collectively may result in autoimmunity and polyautoimmunity, including neuroautoimmunity [43,44,93,95,213,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274,275,276].",
            "In relation to the chronic activation of the immune system that is associated with the five hypotheses mentioned above, COVID-19 patients have shown long-term alterations for up to six months following their discharge in their primary B- and T-cell functions as well as in the vast majority of their CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets, which are critical for the control of intracellular and extracellular pathogenic infections [277]. This long COVID-associated hyperactivation of Th17 and Tfh cells, changes in their subsets, the imbalance between regulatory and pro-inflammatory T-cell subsets in general, unregulated B-cell activation and antibody production increase the possibilities of autoimmune inflammation and autoimmune-related manifestations [124,127,251].",
            "Based on our review of the literature, in both past and recent studies, we have found clues to these mechanisms that might drive this long COVID, with the goal of identifying host or virus factors that can be intervened upon to prevent or reverse this condition. A better understanding of these immunological mechanisms in patients with severe long COVID holds great promise for designing treatment strategies to minimize viral persistence, control the reactivation of latent viruses, and to modulate a dysregulated immune system and host microbiota, which together are involved in the virus-induced inflammation and autoimmunity that are observed in patients with long COVID.",

            "The spectrum of health complications instigated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been diverse and complex. Besides the evident pulmonary and cardiovascular threats, accumulating clinical data points to several neurological complications, which are more common in elderly COVID-19 patients. Recent pieces of evidence have marked events of neuro infection and neuroinvasion, producing several neurological complications in COVID-19 patients; however, a systematic understanding of neuro-pathophysiology and manifested neurological complications, more specifically in elderly COVID-19 patients is largely elusive. Since the elderly population gradually develops neurological disorders with aging, COVID-19 inevitably poses a higher risk of neurological manifestations to the aged patients. In this report, we reviewed SARS-CoV-2 infection and its role in neurological manifestations with an emphasis on the elderly population. We reviewed neuropathological events including neuroinfection, neuroinvasion, and their underlying mechanisms affecting neuromuscular, central- and peripheral- nervous systems. We further assessed the imminent neurological challenges in the COVID-19 exposed population, post-SARS-CoV-2-infection. Given the present state of clinical preparedness, the emerging role of AI and machine learning was also discussed concerning COVID-19 diagnostics and its management. Taken together, the present review summarizes neurological outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated complications, specifically in elderly patients, and underlines the need for their clinical management in advance.",
            "Primary physio-pathological evidence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibited severe respiratory and cardiovascular complications in the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients. Emerging reports lately revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection develops a range of neurological complications (COVIDview, 2020). These complications are produced either by the direct contact of SARS-CoV-2 with the nervous system or by an indirect impact of immune-response during- or post-infection (Ellul et al., 2020). As an estimate, ~35.6% of total COVID-19 cases were found to exhibit multiple neurologic manifestations (Tsai et al., 2020). Although neurological consequences of these events are evident across all age groups, yet, elderly COVID-19 patients remain at remarkably high risk (COVIDview, 2020). An acute phase of direct SARS-CoV-2 infection could produce immediate neurological complications, however, a secondary phase might take months to surface after the infection (Beghi et al., 2020). Multiple nervous tissue/cell types including macrophages, microglia, or astrocytes are invaded by coronaviruses that can cause direct damage to the nerves (Beghi et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). Recent reports also underlined evidence of neurotoxicity primarily caused by immune injury, hypoxia-induced injury, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, a SARS-CoV-2 host receptor) binding (Beghi et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). A recent systematic review analyzed the neuropathological features in patients who have died post-SARS-CoV-2 infection and it revealed that the majority of these patients were elderly (n = 66, 45%) and males (n = 79, 54%; Pajo et al., 2021). The striking neuropathological features they exhibited include diffuse edema (17%), gliosis (having diffuse microglia and astrocytes activation, 35.6%), cortical and subcortical regional infarctions in the brain (2.7%), intracranial (subarachnoid and punctate) hemorrhage (12.4%), arteriosclerosis (29.5%), hypoxic-ischemic injury (28.1%), and inflammation (35.6%). These observed features were suggested to be caused by direct cytopathic and indirect effects derived from host-specific inflammatory response post-SARS-CoV-2 infection (Pajo et al., 2021). These events greatly contribute to the development of neuro-pathophysiological symptoms in elderly COVID-19 patients. Although the long–term neurological complications in individuals who had COVID-19 are still unknown, similar viral infections were shown to exhibit neurological complications after months or years of infection by developing neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairment (Troyer et al., 2020).",
            "The olfactory tract is a preferred route of coronavirus infection to the brain at an early stage, whereas evidence of brain invasion through systemic circulation is scarce (Wu et al., 2020). The common neurological complications resulting from direct infection are found to be encephalitis, myelitis, meningitis, and inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis; whereas, immune-related CNS, peripheral nervous system (PNS) diseases, and the Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) emerged as the major post-infection complications (Beghi et al., 2020; Ellul et al., 2020). By an estimate, 20% of the COVID-19 patients with ICU admittance had neurological complications and faced a high risk of mortality (Fotuhi et al., 2020). Of note, in elderly patients, SARS-CoV-2 instigated neurologic and immunologic complications that have produced severe consequences leading to neurodegenerative diseases (Lennon, 2020; Pavel et al., 2020). Taken together, in the present report we comprehensively reviewed the SARS-CoV-2 routes, neuro-infection or -invasion mechanism(s), their emergent and post-infection neurological manifestations, with a special focus on the elderly patients. We have also shed light on the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning diagnostic applications for COVID-19 patients.",
            "An early clinical case series from Wuhan, China revealed a significant relevance of SARS-CoV-2 infection with developing neurologic complications (Mao et al., 2020). It was estimated that out of 214 COVID-19 patients, 36.4% developed neurologic complications including CNS manifestations (dizziness, headache, acute cerebrovascular disease, diminished consciousness, ataxia, and seizures), PNS manifestations (sensory ailments and neuralgia), and neuromuscular injury (Mao et al., 2020; Figure 1). A retrospective report from Wuhan showed that 5% of a total of 221 COVID-19 patients had incidences of acute ischemic stroke (Guan et al., 2020). A similar retrospective report from Wuhan revealed that 20% of 113 COVID-19 patients suffered from hypoxic encephalopathy (Chen et al., 2020a).",
            "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) neuro-pathophysiology: COVID-19 clinical manifestations associated with diverse neuronal systems/organs including the peripheral nerve, parenchymal, cerebrovascular, meningeal, spinal cord, neuromuscular, and cranial nerve in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.",
            "To assess neurological complications in elderly COVID-19 patients, a cross-hospital nationwide investigation in the UK comprising 125 COVID-19 patients (avg. age 71 years) analyzed clinical data for neurological and psychiatric manifestations and revealed that 62% of the patients suffered from cerebrovascular events, among which 74% were reported with ischemic stroke, 23% developed unspecified encephalopathy and 1% acquired CNS vasculitis (Varatharaj et al., 2020). Noticeably, among the total patients, 31% developed altered mental complications—encephalitis (18%) and intracerebral hemorrhage (12%; Varatharaj et al., 2020). The remaining 59% of the patients met the clinical case definitions of psychiatric diagnoses, among which 43% possessed new-onset psychosis, 26% acquired neurocognitive syndrome, and 17% exhibited an affective disorder (Varatharaj et al., 2020). Of note, 82% of total enrolled COVID-19 patients having cerebrovascular events were aged more than 60 years, which is suggesting that elderly patients are at high risk for COVID-19 associated neurological complications advancing to greater lethality. A retrospective meta-analysis enrolling 1,558 COVID-19 patients from a total of six studies revealed that cerebrovascular disease is a potential risk factor (Wang et al., 2020a). A multi-centric report involving 184 COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU in three Dutch hospitals showed a considerably high (31%) risk of thrombotic complications, while the death of 23 patients among these underlined the severity of such complications (Klok et al., 2020). A multi-centric retrospective study from Chicago, USA, further corroborated the fact that neurological manifestation is a major risk factor in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Liotta et al., 2020). In this study, among the 509 COVID-19 patients, neurological manifestations were revealed at onset (42.2%), hospitalization (62.7%), and other stages of COVID-19 disease (82.3%; Liotta et al., 2020). Another multi-centric retrospective study of SARS-CoV-2 infected hospitalized patients in New York City assessed the prevalence of neurologic disorders, also it analyzed in-hospital mortality and compared manifested features between COVID-19 patients with and without neurologic disorders (Frontera et al., 2021). It strikingly revealed that 13.5% of patients developed a new neurologic disorder in 2 days median time from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. It included toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (6.8%), stroke (1.9%), seizure (1.6%), and hypoxic/ischemic injuries (1.4%), though no patient had meningitis/encephalitis or myelopathy/myelitis due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Frontera et al., 2021). Of note, neurologic disorders were more common in aged patients, wherein the male, white, diabetic, hypertensive, intubated population was vulnerable (all p < 0.05) and faced an increased risk of in-hospital mortality and lesser recovery. This survey suggested that observed neurologic features may be sequelae of severe systemic illness (Frontera et al., 2021).",
            "The neurologic manifestations i.e., myalgias, headaches, dizziness, dysgeusia, and anosmia, of all encephalopathies were found to be associated with poor health outcomes in admitted patients, irrespective of COVID-19 severity (Liotta et al., 2020; Figure 1). In the line, a 2-centric retrospective study from Spain also affirmed that neurological manifestations were frequent in admitted 841 COVID-19 patients (Romero-Sanchez et al., 2020). Montalvan et al. (2020) confirmed it further by systematically reviewing a total of 67 studies, wherein they found that risk of encephalitis, neuropathy, demyelination, and stroke are associated with COVID-19 (Montalvan et al., 2020). Providing insights on the SARS-CoV-2 infection route to the nerve tissue, it was revealed that the virus invasion occurs through the lamina cribrosa or olfactory tract and disperses through the trans-synaptic transfer (Montalvan et al., 2020). Furthermore, another systematic review assessed a greater risk of secondary neurologic complications in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Herman et al., 2020); while, another estimate claimed that 1 out of 3 COVID-19 patients could acquire an altered mental state (Belluck, 2020).",
            "SARS-CoV-2 manifested complications that include the CNS, PNS, and neuromuscular system, range from mild to severe, and can also appear in patients with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infects the host by establishing the binding of its spike (S) glycoproteins to the host ACE2 receptor that expresses in the brain, gastrointestinal tract (GI), respiratory tract, lung parenchyma, and endothelial cells, and therefore it serves as a potential target for the direct COVID-19 inhibitory regimens (Kalra et al., 2021) or indirect suppressive strategies including miRNAs (Li et al., 2018). The most common symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 are dry cough, fever, and lethargy; however, aged adults are more susceptible to severe infection involving shortness of breath, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to higher mortality incidence (Table 1). A natural decline in ACE2 levels, elevated angiotensin signaling, and subsequently chronic low-grade inflammation that develops with advanced age, termed inflammaging, might contribute to the severity and comorbid diabetic and cardiovascular complications in aged individuals (Alghatrif et al., 2020; Kalra et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is a neuro-invasive and neurotrophic virus. Studies implicated that neurological manifestations are primarily associated with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which involves loss of taste, smell, consciousness, vision, seizures, neuralgia, and lack of coordination (Mao et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 can enter the CNS through the olfactory lobe and hematogenous route (Figure 2). A gradual decline of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is associated with normal aging, which may enhance the effect of SARS-CoV-2 in aged individuals (Montagne et al., 2015). SARS-CoV-2 causes neurodegeneration, demyelination, and cellular senescence upon entry; all of these potentiate brain aging and aggravate the underlying pathophysiology of neurodegeneration (Lennon, 2020; Montalvan et al., 2020; Palao et al., 2020; Pavel et al., 2020).",

            "At the beginning stage of infection, patients with the COVID-19 focus on managing cough, dyspnea, fever, and breathing complications. However, it is evident from studies that it gradually led to an increase in neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, anosmia, encephalopathy, and paralysis (Li et al., 2020b; Mao et al., 2020). In 2002 and 2013, during the epidemics of SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Virus (MERS) respectively, the virus caused a detrimental effect in multiple organs, including the brains, nerves, and neuromuscular tissues. SARS-CoV-2, shares homology with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS and therefore emerges as an essential player in causing CNS and PNS injury, either direct or indirect (Nath, 2020; Wu et al., 2020). Neurological abnormalities have been documented in the patients who required hospitalization for COVID-19, respiratory illness, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; Helms et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020). In a clinical case series, neurological symptoms are restricted to general conditions such as headache, loss of smell and taste, dizziness, and malaise in mild conditions, which are routinely observed with viral infection (Mao et al., 2020). Among 1,420 mild-to-moderately infected COVID-19 patients, 70% of the patients experienced headache, which is a prominent neurological manifestation. Noticeably, severe neurological complications can be seen in mild-infected COVID-19 patients in the multiple clinical reports, while patients with pre-existing comorbidities had severe complications resulting in significantly high mortality (Iadecola et al., 2020; Merkler et al., 2020; Oxley et al., 2020; Yaghi et al., 2020; Table 1).",
            "Symptoms related to mental status such as confusion, tiredness, and agitation, collectively known as encephalopathy, have been described in the COVID-19 in few clinical reports (Table 1). Diagnostic criteria for detecting encephalitis have been established and include fever, seizures, focal brain abnormalities, disturbed mental status, and white blood cells in the lymphatic-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; Venkatesan et al., 2013). In the clinical case series, the cognitive level was primarily affected in most critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS (Helms et al., 2020) compared to COVID-19 patients with only respiratory illness (Mao et al., 2020). It is unclear whether the alteration in mental status is due to encephalitis caused by systemic disease or directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, several reports suggest that COVID-19 patients exhibited well-established diagnostic markers for encephalitis (Efe et al., 2020; Farhadian et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020a; Pilotto et al., 2021). In the very first reported case of meningitis/encephalitis associated with COVID-19, Moriguchi et al. (2020) observed SARS-CoV-2 level in the CSF but found only a modest amount of viral RNA load. In another case study, a biopsy from COVID-19 patient showed neuronal loss due to hypoxia and perivascular lymphocyte infiltration confirming temporal lobe encephalitis (Efe et al., 2020). However, Efe et al. (2020) did not detect SARS-CoV-2 in the brain or CSF. Brain tissue samples from autopsies of COVID-19 patients negative for evidence of encephalitis and CSF samples from COVID-19 patients with neurological abnormalities have not revealed evidence of SARS-CoV-2 (Kandemirli et al., 2020). Other significant mental status indicators such as confusion, delirium, and coma may be common symptoms in COVID-19 patients. These indicators are frequently associated with hypotension, kidney disease, usage of sedatives, hypoxia, and prolonged bedridden and isolation conditions—all these factors are significant contributors to the progression of encephalopathy (Helms et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020; Martin-Jimenez et al., 2020; Maas et al., 2021; Rogers et al., 2021). Although SARS-CoV-2 affects all ages, adults aged 65 and older are at higher risk of severe disease, hospitalization, ICU use, and death. Geriatric age patients are prone to loss of consciousness, disorientation, and other cognitive disturbances. Delirium is a common symptom of older people with COVID-19 during hospitalization. Despite the lack of clinical data and histopathological evidence of encephalitis and occurrence of other alternative events impacting mental status, these data so far hint that the potential invasion of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain may be the sporadic cause of encephalopathy.",
            "In retrospective clinical studies, 11 patients out of 221 showed acute ischemic stroke, along with one patient who developed cerebral venous thrombosis and cerebral hemorrhage. The majority of these patients were elderly and were suffering from severe COVID-19 along with common comorbidities (Li et al., 2020b). A small clinical case study from the UK, comprising six severely affected patients showed cerebral infarcts and elevated D-dimer levels, suggesting a coagulopathy (Beyrouti et al., 2020). In another small case study of five young patients, COVID-19 related strokes were shown to cause large-vessel infarct (Oxley et al., 2020). Al Saiegh et al. (2020) in a small case report, could not demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF of aged patients that had an ischaemic stroke. Hypoxia, produced by lack of oxygen, increases stroke incidence due to impairment in sleep structure, increases blood pressure, atherosclerosis, promotes micro thrombosis, and decreases the blood flow (Lee et al., 2019). In a case series, Mao et al. (2020) showed that six hospitalized COVID-19 patients exhibited acute cerebrovascular disease, among these, five had a severe infection (5/88) and one was in non-severe condition (1/125). The symptoms of hypoxia are coupled with COVID-19, and it was predicted to be a consequence of S-protein’s interaction with hemoglobin (Agrawal et al., 2021); therefore, it was believed to potentiate the patient’s necessity for ventilator support. Of note, in a single-centric case series, the COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU were relatively old, and they had a more significant number of comorbid conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular complication, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease, in comparison to those who did not require ICU (Wang et al., 2020b). The findings of this clinical case series imply that aging and comorbidities may be risk factors for poor neurological and survival outcomes (Wang et al., 2020a; Table 1). Seizure is a rare symptom in the COVID-19 setting. Reports involving a retrospective multi-centric study and a case series could not observe stroke in COVID-19 patients despite metabolic alteration (Lu et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020).",
            "Moein et al. (2020) in the earliest analysis derived from a cohort of 100 COVID-19 patients showed that loss of smell sensation (anosmia) and taste sensation (ageusia) is the most common neurological manifestation of COVID-19, even in mild to moderate cases. Smell sensation is more affected compared to the taste sensation. Emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can enter the neuronal cells through the olfactory nerve and spreads to the olfactory bulb (Figure 2). Lechien and colleagues in a multi-centric European study and a case report showed that 86% and 88% of COVID-19 patients respectively, reported the loss of smell and taste (Lechien et al., 2020a, b). Cranial neuropathy is an erratic event in the setting of COVID-19; however, one case study involving a 40-year-old female COVID-19 patient showed isolated oculomotor nerve palsy in severely ill patients, which could be due to inflammatory reaction against SARS-CoV-2 (Wei et al., 2020). COVID-19 can cause detrimental effects to the peripheral nerves, cranial nerve, and neuromuscular tissue. Dyspnea, facial weakness, inability to stand or walk, or struggling with weaning off respiratory ventilators might be partially due to GBS expedited by COVID-19. GBS is frequently observed neurological complications in COVID-19 (Zhao et al., 2020a). Miller-Fisher syndrome is measured by the acute onset of external loss of tendon reflexes, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. In a clinical case report in Spain, involving a hospitalized 64-year old male COVID-19 patient, clinical features and eye movement abnormalities were found to be consistent with the diagnosis of Miller-Fisher Syndrome and polyneuritis cranialis. The symptoms consisted of ataxia, fascicular palsy, areflexia, anosmia, and ageusia (Table 1). This patient received Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and showed rapid recovery (Gutierrez-Ortiz et al., 2020). In a case report from three hospitals in northern Italy, comprising five patients who had GBS syndrome, one patient diagnosed with COVID-19 exhibited sensory ataxia, facial weakness, and facial nerve, though this patient responded positively to the treatment with IVIg and improved within a week (Toscano et al., 2020). The other four patients showed more GBS and a variable degree of COVID-19 symptoms. The severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients depend on age and pre-existing comorbidities, and ongoing treatment regimen. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is particularly prevalent in young adults; however, a substantial number of individuals with MS are older than 60 years (Minden et al., 2004). Managing MS during the COVID-19 pandemic is critical for patient’s health management as there are no evidence-based guidelines and published literature yet available. In general, elderly patients (≥65 years) are susceptible to COVID-19 severity and mortality. Analyses from a Sonya Slifka Longitudinal MS study indicated that 10–20% of MS patients are more than 65 years old (Minden et al., 2004). However, whether it could impact the COVID-19 mortality in older patients given their impaired immune regulation, yet need to be elucidated (Berger et al., 2020). Besides the age, other comorbidities are correlated in the MS population cohorts as well with increased risk of severity and mortality (reviewed by Marrie et al., 2015a, b).",
            "In one cross-sectional study in Europe, 1,931 MS patients were engaged to determine the mortality associated with COVID-19 (Bsteh et al., 2020). Out of 1,931 patients, 63% showed a low risk of COVID-19 mortality, 26% had mild risk, 8.8% had moderate risk, while 0.9% exhibited a high risk of COVID-19 mortality. Only one patient received disease-modifying treatment (DMT) in the high-risk category, and none had any immunosuppressive therapy. The increased risk of COVID-19 mortality is below 1% in the population-based MS cohort (Bsteh et al., 2020). At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians recommended delaying treatment with DMT in MS patients (Giovannoni et al., 2020). Recent data has suggested that COVID-19 positive MS patients are not different from the general MS population (Parrotta et al., 2020). However, clinicians and physicians need to be vigilant for prescribing the drugs and recommendations regarding MS to guide their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "As per a clinical case series analysis of 214 COVID-19 patients, 11% of patients were reported to have evidence of neuromuscular injury (Mao et al., 2020). The damage was more prominent in severely affected (19%) than non-severely affected individuals (5%); however, these results do not indicate whether the damage is due to the COVID-19 neuromuscular infection. Such injuries were suggested to be due to SARS-CoV-2 infection-mediated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, no clinical details are yet available beyond the presence of neuromuscular pain. Lately, two reports suggested it to be rhabdomyolysis as its clinical features were manifested in COVID-19 infected patients (Jin and Tong, 2020; Suwanwongse and Shabarek, 2020). Rhabdomyolysis is skeletal/neuromuscular damage that can be a manifestation of COVID-19. In a case report, a 35-year-old female was found to have rhabdomyolysis correlated with COVID-19 (Alrubaye and Choudhury, 2020). Clinical data from the report suggests that clinicians should examine the level of liver enzyme and myalgia, which could serve as clinical features of rhabdomyolysis in COVID-19 patients. Detailed analysis of the CSF pro-inflammatory and T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is urgently warranted to comprehensively understand the neuromuscular manifestation in COVID-19 patients.",
            "Although we presently lack a distinct and detailed analysis of SARS-CoV-2 -manifested neurological complications including CNS, PNS, and neuromuscular injuries in the aged population, we summarize the key clinical reports/case studies involving elderly COVID-19 patients in Table 1.",
            "Like COVID-19, other coronaviruses viz. SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) have also been associated with various prolonged neurological complications (Chan et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2018). As discussed earlier, the most common neurological difficulties in COVID-19 include anosmia, ageusia, and headache, moreover, more serious complications, such as stroke, impaired consciousness, seizures, and encephalopathy have also been reported. Reports on these neurological and neuropsychological complications during and after the course of COVID-19 infection are growing rapidly. Focusing on the aging population, we have here limited our discussion about post-COVID-19 neurological and neuropsychological complications reported only in elderly patients.",
            "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), an autoimmune disease of the CNS, that mainly affects children has been observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. However, most of the cases reported to be diagnosed with ADEM post-COVID-19 have been aged 50 years or above. But this might be biased given the higher prevalence of COVID-19 in adults. Amongst these reported cases was a 51-year-old female who developed clinical coma and an impaired oculocephalic response to one side post-COVID-19 infection, which was later diagnosed to be acute multifocal demyelinating lesions (Parsons et al., 2020). Another case study reported a 64-year-old woman with ADEM, who was hospitalized with mild behavioral abnormalities, headache, bilateral relative afferent pupillary defect, ageusia and anosmia, severe visual loss, right abdominal sensory level, and left-sided lower limb hyperreflexia with the Babinski sign (Novi et al., 2020). Both these patients recovered with the administration of high-dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins. ADEM was also diagnosed in the post-mortem biopsy of a 71-year-old male (Reichard et al., 2020). In another case study, similar immune-mediated brain damage was also detected in a 58-year-old male patient. The patient was hospitalized with low consciousness and loss of ability to walk. The patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection even though pulmonary symptoms like cough or dyspnea were not observed. Though the patient initially responded to steroids but then died of status epilepticus (Abdi et al., 2020). Another case study of a likewise neurological syndrome that commonly called as acute myelitis has also been reported in a 69-year-old female (Sotoca and Rodriguez-Alvarez, 2020). The first clinical case of COVID-19 associated acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy was reported by Poyiadji et al. (2020) in a 58-year-old female airline worker. This rare neurological condition was attributed to intracranial cytokine storm and disruption of the BBB without the direct viral invasion (Serrano-Castro et al., 2020). Investigating the case study of a 75-year-old man, Hayashi et al. (2020) have suggested that mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesion can also be considered as a neurological symptom in patients developing transient cerebellar ataxia or disorientations. To add to this list of neurological complications, vasculitis of CNS has also been reported to occur in a 65-year-old man (Hanafi et al., 2020). Along with CNS, the PNS has also been affected in COVID-19 patients. Pascual-Goni et al. (2020) reported a 60-year-old female patient who after 10 days of fever, hyposmia, nausea, and coughing experienced diplopia and right hemicranial headache that was later diagnosed as right abducens nerve palsy.",
            "In terms of post-COVID-19 neuropsychological impact, a study concerning 700 clinically stable COVID-19 patients (mean age 50.2 ± 12.9 years) were examined for post-traumatic stress symptoms, and nearly 96% of the patient were found to be suffering from significant post-traumatic stress (Bo et al., 2020). A much larger cohort study involving 112 hospitalized patients and 2,001 non-hospitalized patients from Belgium and Netherland has revealed that symptoms like neuromuscular pain, dizziness, headaches, fatigue, and anosmia prevail also in asymptomatic or very mildly symptomatic patients even after months of contracting the disease (Goertz et al., 2020). Some patients treated for severe COVID-19 have been reported with disabling fatigue and impaired cognitive abilities after being discharged from the hospitals (Zhou et al., 2020a; Halpin et al., 2021). Also, the detection of delirium, the most common acute neuropsychiatric syndrome, has been significantly linked to COVID-19 in older adults and those with dementia (Poloni et al., 2020).",
            "Considering these features of neuropathological manifestations discussed above, here we shed light on the SARS-CoV-2 infection, its diverse routes, the mechanism(s), and associated neurological complications.",
            "The neurotropic, neuroinvasive, and neurovirulent characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 were recognized in both humans and animals (Lima et al., 2020). Recent evidence suggested that coronaviruses can infect primary human neural cells, microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Lima et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the host ACE2 receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its Spike (S) protein. ACE2 receptor ubiquitously expresses in all human tissues including CNS and the endothelial cells. Emerging evidence reveals that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor to invade neurons in CNS via distinct routes as discussed here (Figure 2).",
            "Coronaviruses can efficiently invade the epithelial-humoral route and disrupt the primary epithelial barrier to attain access into the bloodstream. ACE2 abundantly expresses on the alveolar epithelial cells (Type II) that makes these cells a preferred target for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Lima et al., 2020). Also, an abundant expression of ACE2 on the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract raises their vulnerability for SARS-CoV-2 infection and access to the bloodstream (Li et al., 2020b; Figure 2). On ensuring access to the systemic circulation, SARS-CoV-2 disrupts the endothelial barrier of the BBB or the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) via its interaction with ACE2 receptors at the endothelial cells and subsequent CNS contact (Li et al., 2020b). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 like particles in the neural and frontal lobe capillary endothelial cells of the patient who died with COVID-19 affirmed the hematogenous-endothelial route of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion (Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 was also suggested to cross BBB by inducing inflammation or hypoxemia by stimulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Li et al., 2020b; Lima et al., 2020). The pro-inflammatory cytokines viz. interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were suggested to play a part in SARS-CoV-2 cellular invasion (Achar and Ghosh, 2020). However, it is unclear if induction of these pro-inflammatory cytokines is a result of SARS-CoV-2 cellular invasion activity or it reflects an elicited antiviral immune response for its neutralization/clearance. Multiple clinical reports exhibited a surge in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2, and IFN-γ levels in COVID-19 patients that was attributed to an activated neutrophils and leucocytes immune function, but the decline in lymphocyte/T Cell response (Gong et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020b; Liu et al., 2020). Therefore, further studies are warranted to elucidate the nature and cause of these elicited pro-inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients and if it has a relation to SARS-CoV-2 immuno-invasive activity.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 particles were primarily suggested to enter the nerve termini and undergo replication before transportation to the soma and ensuring CNS invasion (Li et al., 2020b). Among the potential SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion routes, the olfactory tract serves as an important route for respiratory viruses (Meinhardt et al., 2020; Figure 2). Also, the peripheral nerves namely trigeminal and vagus nerves that innervate distinct parts of the respiratory tract were suggested to be the target of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion (Yavarpour-Bali and Ghasemi-Kasman, 2020). SARS-CoV-2 invades the neural-mucosal interface via its transmucosal entry across the nervous assemblies followed by their access to the olfactory tract of the CNS (Meinhardt et al., 2020). Coronaviruses can also invade CNS via a synapse-connected route by infecting the peripheral nerve terminals (Dube et al., 2018; Lima et al., 2020). Dube et al. (2018) earlier claimed that human coronavirus (HCoV OC43) might also actively transport through axonal transport by axoplasmic flow and/or may passively diffuse across this channel. SARS-CoV-2 is believed to enter CNS via trigeminal nerves that innervate nociceptor cells in the nasal fossa; while the sensory terminal of the trigeminal nerves exits in the conjunctiva (Lima et al., 2020). The finding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment in the ocular discharge of a patient with conjunctivitis (Zhang et al., 2020) further suggested trigeminal nerve-mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2 to CNS.",
            "The bronchus and trachea tissues comprise a rich and intricate lymphatic network. The olfactory nerve perineural and nasal lymphatic tissue space is suggested to facilitate the CSF drainage by communicating with the channels constituted by ensheathing cells (Figure 2). Of note, endothelial cells in lymphatic networks express CD209L receptor that was claimed to be another receptor facilitating coronavirus invasion (Li et al., 2007). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in the cells of lymphoid organs affirmed the functioning of the CSF route in the SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion (Chen et al., 2020b). These pieces of evidence postulating invasion of CNS by SARS-CoV-2 involve perivascular or lymphatic path as an alternative route (Ylikoski et al., 2020).",
            "Coronaviruses-infected lymphatic/immune cells i.e., T cells, monocytes, and neutrophils were suggested to serve as reservoirs for the virus and were capable to enter and infect the CNS (Iadecola et al., 2020; Figure 2). These immune cells travel to the brain through the meninges and the choroid plexus vasculature (Engelhardt et al., 2017), which could serve as the entry sites for SARS-CoV-2 infected immune cells. As discussed earlier, immune cells also express ACE2 that serves as the molecular receptor for coronaviruses (Lima et al., 2020). Although presently we lack any direct clinical evidence of SARS-CoV-2 invasion of immune cells (Merad and Martin, 2020), immunoreactivity of CD169+ cells for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was seen in the lymph node splenic marginal zone and marginal sinuses (Chen et al., 2020b). Given the fact that CD169+ macrophages amply express ACE-2, makes them a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion that may further facilitate the entry of infected immune cells to CNS (Park, 2020). Consistent with this, the presence of viral RNA in the macrophages of broncho-alveolar lavage in the COVID-19 patient further highlights the role of infected lymphatic/immune cells in SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion (Bost et al., 2020). This evidence postulates that SARS-CoV-2 may infect circulating immune cells and could potentially exploit them to disseminate/invade through the CNS (Figure 2). However, it is still unclear if such presence of SARS-CoV-2 virions/single strand RNA is due to its macrophage invasion or was a result of active phagocytic uptake of the infected cell or SARS-CoV-2 virion (Bost et al., 2020; Merad and Martin, 2020). In contrast, few clinical autopsy reports from COVID-19 patients showed a lack of any infected immune cell infiltration to CNS (Kantonen et al., 2020; Solomon et al., 2020).",
            "The secretion of interferons is the foremost antiviral defense acquired by the immune cells that also stimulate the neighboring immune cells. Coronaviruses can evade the host immune response by producing severe leukopenia and lymphopenia (Wong et al., 2003; Zaki et al., 2012). Earlier investigations on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV revealed that coronaviruses encode proteins that modulate downstream regulation of TLRs and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway by interacting with their effectors in immune cells. For instance, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV encoded protein PLpro, inhibits the NF-κB from IκBα dissociation, while, SARSCoV’s PLpro and ORF3b proteins block IRF3 phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation (Devaraj et al., 2007; Signaling et al., 2009). The role of these viral proteins was also implicated in the inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway (Menachery et al., 2014). In the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection of immune cells, an overall decline in the transcription of antiviral genes was reported due to decreased Type I and III interferons production and an elevated chemokine secretion (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020). Of note, results from in vivo and ex vivo SARS-CoV-2 experiments affirmed in vitro findings and thereby suggested that a decline in the innate antiviral response with instigated hyper-inflammation, could be a potential mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 invasion of immune cells and may contribute to COVID-19 severity (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020). Apart from reducing the T cell number, SARS-CoV-2 also causes effector T cell exhaustion as another mechanism to compromise immune cell function (Diao et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 exhausted effector T cells as a result show elevated levels of inhibitory receptors viz. PD-1, TIM-3, and TIGIT at its surface given the IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α exposure and declined regulatory T cell function (Chiappelli et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2020).",
            "As mentioned, SARS-CoV-2 invasion requires ACE2 for S-protein binding followed by its priming by cell proteases TRMPSS2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Recent studies also implicated the role of heparan sulfate at the host cell membrane in facilitating the S-protein and ACE2 binding and viral invasion (Clausen et al., 2020; Kalra and Kandimalla, 2021). Co-expression analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 revealed that nasal goblet, ciliated epithelial cells, and oligodendrocytes ubiquitously express both the proteins (Sardu et al., 2020). More specifically, ACE2-TMPRSS2 co-expression in oligodendrocytes could potentiate CNS infiltration as clinical features of acute encephalitis as observed in COVID-19 patients (Hung et al., 2003; Ding et al., 2004). As discussed in the earlier section, coronaviruses can invade the CNS either by a neuronal or humoral/hematogenous route (Figure 2). Therein, early anosmia, i.e., a primary feature of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion that occurs through the olfactory bulb, whereas a retrograde migration of human coronaviruses to olfactory nerve and the CNS via nasal epithelium was studied in the murine model (Netland et al., 2008). An earlier study reported an eight-fold increase in the frequency of human coronaviruses infected cells in the CNS that was specifically noticeable in the hippocampus post 1–2 weeks of infection (Chan et al., 2020).",
            "An alternative route of CNS entry for coronaviruses is through the BBB that comprises conditions/factors including endothelins, inflammatory mediators, infected macrophages shipping the virus, or directly infected endothelial cells (Edwards et al., 2000; Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020; Sardu et al., 2020). Once the virus reaches the CNS, it starts swift trans-neuronal spread and produces neurotoxicity in infected ACE2-positive neutrons, as validated in transgenic mice models (Netland et al., 2008). Although both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 bind to ACE2 receptor for host cell entry, recent phylogenetic and virus–receptor binding structural data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 recognizes ACE2 more effectively (Wan et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). Therefore, high expression of ACE2 in brain endothelial cells, neurons, and glial cells, makes these neurological cells more prone to SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion (Hamming et al., 2004). SARS-CoV-2 recognition of ACE2 may disrupt the delicate balance of ACE-ACE2 cerebrovascular control that could result in incessantly activated ACE signal, severe vasoconstriction, or interrupted cerebral autoregulation. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity in these tissues was found to elicit IL-1β, -2, -6, -7, -8, -10, -17, INFγ, G-CSF, TNFα, MCP1, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (Pedersen and Ho, 2020). The triggered levels of these pro-inflammatory factors produce a “cytokine storm” and are known to be associated with poor clinical outcomes. Besides ARDS, cytokine storm produces severe neurotoxicity by compromising the integrity of the BBB, in absence of direct viral transport or neuroinvasion. These features speculated that acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), may essentially be produced by cytokine-induced neurotoxicity (Ouattara et al., 2011). Therefore, cytokine-induced neurotoxicity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients may upset neurologic outcomes (Allan and Rothwell, 2001).",
            "Among the different age groups of COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital, the aforementioned neurological mechanisms were severely deregulated in the elderly population and have exposed their vulnerability (reviewed by COVIDview, 2020; Lekamwasam and Lekamwasam, 2020). These mechanisms of neurological complications underlined the role of disrupted immune function or cytokine-induced neurotoxicity in elderly COVID-19 patients. Koff and Williams (2020) reviewed the consequence of diminished immunity in the aging population and how COVID-19 took advantage of it to exploit it further (Koff and Williams, 2020).",
            "During this COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals and other healthcare services have experienced severe crises and are opening up to technologies that can be used in clinical settings as a support system for the frontline healthcare workers in the detection and containment of such diseases. AI is one of those technologies with long–term value. Not only diagnostics but AI is also being employed in hospitals to handle the rapidly increasing load of patients. To manage a similar situation in Boston, Partners HealthCare came up with a hotline service for patients, clinicians, and others with concerns related to COVID-19. The main aim of this initiative was: (i) to identify the class of people with mild symptoms who did not need additional care, to provide them with relevant information and direct them to relevant virtual care options; (ii) to manage the small high-risk patients by linking them to testing sites, newly created respiratory illness clinics, or emergency department of hospitals in case necessary. This initiative was further expanded in collaboration with St. Joseph Health system in Seattle and Microsoft, which served more than 40,000 patients in the 1st week itself. In line with this, smart AI bots are also being developed as chatbots to manage the increasing needs of patients and clinicians. Moving a step ahead, a group of researchers at MIT has trained an AI model that can distinguish asymptomatic people from healthy individuals through their forced-cough recordings. The model was able to accurately detect 98.5% of COVID-19 positive people, which included 100% cases of coughs submitted by asymptomatic patients (Laguarta et al., 2020). Though still in its infancy, such technology can be used as a pre-screening tool in various situations. Another group has reported an AI-based screening model for early detection of COVID-19 using the routinely collected healthcare data (laboratory tests, blood gas measurements, and vital signs) that typically become available within the first hour of presentation to any hospital with regular laboratory infrastructure (Soltan et al., 2020). During the 2 weeks of testing phase at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford and the Horton General Hospital in Banbury, this AI model could correctly predict the COVID-19 status of 92.3% of patients admitted to the emergency departments. So, as an alternative to the swab test that takes typically a day’s time for results, this AI screening maintained the flow through the hospital by confidently predicting the negative COVID-19 cases. Several governments and hospitals across the globe are also using AI-powered sensors to identify suspected patients. Of note, physician-researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital are trying to make use of intelligent robots (developed at Boston Dynamics and MIT) to monitor vital signs in COVID-19 patients and deliver their medications (Wittbold et al., 2020). This will assure the least human contact with infected patients and thus control disease transmission.",
            "Scaling AI for better explainability and transparency of imaging for diagnostics is another major direction to improve upon. An AI algorithm has also been constituted that integrates a spectrum of chest CT imaging features with clinical symptoms, exposure history, and laboratory testing to rapidly diagnose COVID-19 positive patients. The trained model was able to achieve an Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.92, indicating a sensitivity comparable to that of a senior thoracic radiologist. It was also able to detect 17 out of 25 COVID-19 positive patients, who were reported as negative by the radiologists (Mei et al., 2020). Jin et al. (2020) have also reported a similar model that makes use of chest CTs for COVID-19 detection. In China, an AI-driven CT scan interpreter has been installed in Zhongnan Hospital that helps in the diagnosis of COVID-19 when radiologists are not available (Wittbold et al., 2020). Furthermore, this technology can have direct implications in the detection of post-COVID-19 neurological complications as well. For example, AI could have been efficiently used in the study to systematically characterize neurological symptoms in COVID-19 infected people that involved neuroimaging of about 108 patients from multiple institutions in Italy (Mahammedi et al., 2020). AI thus holds the promising potential to develop into a mainstream diagnostic for fast and efficient detection of various diseases.",
            "Although AI seems to be a promising solution to our growing healthcare needs, it needs to be executed with human clinical expert decision-making at appropriate levels to ensure high quality and safe delivery of AI outcomes. AI can only be an aid but cannot be a replacement for human clinical reasoning and decision making.",
            "Emerging clinical data revealed that neurologic manifestations are frequent in elderly and severely sick COVID-19 patients that significantly raised their mortality. Also, existing comorbidities in COVID-19 patients can further contribute to the neurological complications and impact the clinical outcome. Existing neurological conditions, neurodegenerative ailments, and inflammation in the elderly population were found to worsen the clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients. Although emerging clinical evidence underlined the role of neuroinvasion, neuroinflammation, immunopathogenesis, and hypoxemia in the development of CNS manifestations, the molecular mechanism of COVID-19 neurotoxicity is not yet completely known. Therefore, direct involvement of the above events during or post-SARS-CoV-2 infection is unclear to assess their exact clinical outcomes in elderly COVID-19 patients. Given the diverse and complex clinical signatures of COVID-19 affecting multiple cross-histological functions, it warrants more concerted efforts to distinctly characterize the molecular events involved in its pathogenesis, more importantly in elderly patients. Clinical data revealing SARS-CoV-2 presence in the brain postulated neuroinvasion theory, therefore, direct contact of SARS-CoV-2 with the nervous system is clinically relevant. However, the lack of SARS-CoV-2 virion/mRNA in CSF in the majority of the COVID-19 cases hinted at an alternative viral gateway. Also, in COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation and immune response appeared to further exacerbate the neurologic complications. Given the fact that COVID-19 infection severity has a direct link with the extent of inflammation, the possibility of deregulated immune function in neurotoxicity cannot be excluded. Incidences of “cytokine storm” in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are seen to greatly contribute to neurological complications, more often in elderly patients. Therefore, in the COVID-19 patients, virus-induced inflammation is suggested to play a key role in potentiating neurological complications. However, it requires further investigation at the molecular and systemic level to precisely define the pathophysiological relevance of these events in neurological complications.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 infected elderly patients are at higher risk of neurological complications. These complications beyond producing acute illness can also exert prolong impact on the functioning of the nervous system. These facts made aged COVID-19 patient’s health management more complex, even greater for those having preexisting comorbidities. Careful assessment of these features in admitted elderly COVID-19 patients with the help of advanced AI and machine learning can make COVID-19 diagnostics more efficient and could also save lives. Conclusively, COVID-19 associated neurological complications are a serious health concern and require more concerted investigative efforts to understand and intervene in their progression in elderly patients.",

            "The new coronavirus disease COVID-19 was identified in December 2019. It subsequently spread across the world with over 125 M reported cases and 2.75 M deaths in 190 countries. COVID-19 causes severe respiratory distress; however, recent studies have reported neurological consequences of infection by the COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2 even in subjects with mild infection and no initial neurological effects. It is likely that the virus uses the olfactory nerve to reach the CNS and that this transport mechanism enables virus access to areas of the brain stem that regulates respiratory rhythm and may even trigger cell death by alteration of these neuronal nuclei. In addition, the long-term neuronal effects of COVID-19 suggest a role for SARS-CoV-2 in the development or progression of neurodegerative disease as a result of inflammation and/or hypercoagulation. In this review recent findings on the mechanism(s) by which SARS-CoV-2 accesses the CNS and induces neurological dysregulation are summarized.",
            "The central nerve system (CNS) is protected from pathogens by effective immune responses and physical barriers including the blood brain barrier (BBB) and blood cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) barriers (1). However, viral infection of the CNS does occur and may cause disease via direct viral-induced neuronal damage or by inflammatory- or immune-mediated pathologic mechanisms (1).",
            "Brain cells express immune receptors that recruit leukocytes to the CNS upon detection an infection. The initial inflammatory response upon neurological infection frequently leads to an increase in the permeability of the BBB and potentially as a consequence severe neurological damage (1, 2). Viral infections can induce serious CNS injury including encephalitis or severe acute demyelinating lesions (3). In addition, viruses induce the production of chemokines and cytokines such as type I interferon (IFN) and the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-1 by neurons in vivo and in vitro (4). To control the immune response and avoid immune mediated tissue damage, the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-10 is enhanced within the CNS upon viral infection. This tight regulation of immune responses within the CNS is important since neurons are highly specialized cells with a limited regenerative capacity (3).",
            "Previous studies have shown the neurotropism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) and highlighted their ability to cause brain infection in patients with SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (3). Considering the high degree of similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 should possess a similar mechanism for the induction of CNS injury and brain damage. In this review, an overview on the mechanism(s) by which SARS-CoV-2 accesses the CNS and induces neurological dysregulation is described.",
            "Neuro-invasion is a common feature of human coronaviruses (5). Autopsy findings have confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV in the brain tissue and CSF of patients with severe SARS or MERS by electron microscopy, reverse transcription PCR and by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (6–8). Interestingly, the RNA of human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) was detected in the brain tissue of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients (9, 10) and their putative role in chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), headache and MS has recently been suggested (11).",
            "Coronaviruses are able to locate to the brain via synapse-connected routes. For example, coronaviruses may first infect peripheral nerve terminals and reach the CNS via retrograde transport (12). Neurotropism of coronaviruses was first described with swine hemaglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) (13). Oronasal inoculation of HEV in suckling piglets indicated primary viral replication in nasal epithelial cells, tonsils and the small intestine. Subsequently, the virus was transported to the CNS and brain stem via retrograde transport along the peripheral nervous system. Viral spread into the cerebrum, spinal cord and neural plexuses of the stomach was also observed in the later stages of HEV infection which affected the peristaltic function of the digestive tract, resulting in anorexia and vomiting (13).",
            "In experimental models, HCoV-OC43 was able to reach the CNS via the olfactory route by neuron-to-neuron transmission and to replicate in the brain stem and spinal cord (14). The infectivity of adults with a normal immune system to HCoV-OC43 results in a mild chronic or latent disease but in immunocompromised individuals and children this virus may lead to lethal acute encephalitis (15). Furthermore, intranasal infection of mice with SARS or MERS-CoVs evoked rapid histopathological changes in the brain stem and thalamus (7). This further supports the concept that viral transmission to these brain areas was predominantly via the olfactory nodes (8).",
            "Considering the high similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 might show a similar mechanism of CNS invasion (16). Non-neural cells in the olfactory system express high levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and for this reason can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 (17). These cells have a supportive role for mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and can transfer the virus to OSNs through axonal transport (14). This process enables the penetration of neuroinvasive viruses other than SARS-CoV-2 into the brain and the generation of a local inflammatory response which may act as trigger of neurodegenerative diseases (18, 19). Thus, the early occurrence of loss of smell or hyposmia during COVID-19 infections should be taken into consideration as a marker for subsequent CNS involvement (20).",
            "Neuronal entry of SARS-CoV-2 may also occur via a neuropilin-1 (NRP1)-related pathway. NRP1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor and can bind furin-cleaved substrates (21). NRP1 is highly expressed in endothelial and epithelial cells of the respiratory and olfactory systems (22) and in vagal and other sensory neurons (23). The coronavirus spike (S1) protein contains a furin cleavage site (24) which suggests that it has the potential to activate NRP1 and gain cell entry (25). Interestingly, monoclonal antibody against NRP1 significantly reduces viral infectivity significantly (21).",
            "Another suggested mechanism accounting for viral entry into the brain is the systemic circulation and disruption of the BBB (26). ACE2 receptors are widespread throughout the brain stem including regions with high vascularization and a leaky BBB would allow viral infection that may subsequently induce or accelerate neurodegeneration (26). Noroviruses can infect the endothelial cells that are one of the three cell types that contribute to the BBB and increase the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This, in turn, decreases the expression of tight junction proteins resulting in increased permeability of the BBB (27). Furthermore, replication and budding of the virus, along with the subsequent expression of inflammation cytokines, will disrupt the normal function of the BBB and enable virus access to the CNS (15). This mechanism is observed with viruses such as hepatitis E virus (28) and encephalitic alpha viruses (29). Because of the high expression of ACE2 in cellular components of the BBB, it is suggested that the disruption of BBB by SARS-CoV-2 may play the main role in the central and peripheral nervous system damage seen in severe COVID-19 (30).",
            "Rather than destruction of the BBB, other viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (31) and Zika virus (32, 33) enter the CNS through a Trojan horse mechanism in which they infected monocytes which shuttle them across the BBB. Coronaviruses have the same potential as HIV to constitute a reservoir in leukocytes and use them as carrier to spread into the other tissues (34). There are reports indicating that ACE2-expressing CD68+CD169+ macrophages may act as a Trojan horse and contribute to viral spread of SARS-CoV-2 (34) although this needs to be confirmed (Figure 1). Furthermore, the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can cross the BBB and reach CNS via absorptive mediated transcytosis (AMT) in mice (35).",
            "The possible mechanisms of virus entry to CNS and brain injury during SARS-Cov2 infection. SARS-Cov2 can reach the central nervous system (CNS) by retrograde transmission along the peripheral nervous system; by activation of the neuropilin-1 (NRP1) receptor; via the systemic circulation and disruption of the BBB. Viral infection can cause aggregation α-synuclein and trigger α-synucleinopthies. Viral replication triggers cytokine storm and case to vascular leakage and BBB disruption. Virus infection may trigger brain hypoxia during which hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1α) is activated in the brain and promotes the production of IL-6 TNF-α and M1 MQ polarization at the site of infection. Hypxia in the brain impairs metabolic pathways and further promotes neurodegeneration and brain injury.",
            "Headache, dizziness, chronic fatigue, musculoskeletal pain with fever and taste and smell disorders are reported as the most common neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients. Dry cough is also a common symptom of COVID-19 and is considered as a neurological consequence. Viral infection of the sensory nerves and of the airway vagus nerve promote neuroinflammation and neuroimmune interactions that probably initiate cough (36).",
            "The occurrence of cough together with fatigue, dyspnoea and pain further confirms the CNS injury in COVID-19 patients (36). Chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia (fatigue accompanied by musculoskeletal pain, sleep, memory and mood concerns) in COVID-19 patients have also been associated with alterations in the processing of pain and sensory signals by the brain (37) in these patients.",
            "The persistence of these neurological symptoms for many months in COVID-19 recovered subjects is described as “post-COVID syndrome (PCS)” or long COVID (38, 39). Some patients also struggle with clouding of consciousness so-called mental fog (involving memory and focusing problems and a lack of mental clarity) for a long time after recovery which exert a deleterious effect on their daily activities (40, 41). The mechanism behind the post-COVID syndrome has not been completely clear but it may be the result of neuroinflammatory reactions in the brain.",
            "Brain MRI imaging (42) in the patients with long COVID have shown cortical signal abnormalities and neuroinflammation. On the other hand PET imaging has shown bilateral hypometabolism in the olfactory gyrus, brain stem and the cerebellum (43) in patients. Analysis of 19 mild and 32 severe COVID-19 patients with no specific neurological symptoms during acute infection and no obvious lesions seen using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 3 months after discharge indicated decreased cerebral blood flow and the presence of brain microstructure changes. Changes including decreased cortical thickness, white manner microstructure, particularly in the frontal and limbic systems, were more evident in subjects with severe disease and correlated with the degree of systemic inflammation observed (44).",
            "ACE2 expression in the human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons and in P2RX3 (purinergic receptor P2X3) pain receptors and the subsequent damage of these nerves upon viral infection might be responsible for the post-COVID neurological symptoms (45, 46).",
            "Although it is too early to describe the challenge and clinical features of PCNS as a novel syndrome there is a clear need for neurological monitoring of COVID-19 survivors and further studies to managing the future challenge in this issue.",
            "There is a large body of evidence suggesting a role for specific pathogens, especially viruses, in the initiation or facilitation of neurodegenerative disease. The early evidence for a viral cause of Parkinsonism was during an outbreak of encephalitis lethargica (EL) in 1918–30 that occurred during and after the 1918 influenza outbreak (47). In this case, a large number of patients with an acute episode of EL developed post-encephalitic Parkinsonism (48).",
            "In addition, nasal administration of the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus into mice results in microglial activation and α-synuclein aggregation in virus-infected brain areas that persisted long after the resolution of the infection. Infection also resulted in a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra (SN) (49).",
            "To date, 36.4% of patients with COVID-19 have shown neurological symptoms (50) and viral particles have been detected in the postmortem brains of COVID-19 victims (26). The first case of SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological injury was a 24-year-old man with meningitis who was admitted to hospital on the 9th day after the onset of symptoms with convulsions and unconsciousness. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the patient's CSF but was not detectable in the nasopharyngeal swab (51).",
            "COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological defects vary from non-specific to specific symptoms (52, 53) and autopsy results have shown edema and neuronal degeneration in the brain tissue of COVID-19 victims (50). However, the pathophysiological mechanism behind the SARS-CoV-2-associated encephalitis is not fully understood. The virus may induce nerve damage through several mechanisms including direct infection (54) or an immunologic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (55).",
            "The induction of the type I IFNs provide the first line of immune defense against CNS viral infection (56) which consequently trigger and regulate the specific adaptive immune responses to limit viral spread (57). However, other defense mechanisms may exist as well. Viral infection, for example, can lead to an aggregation of proteins including α-synuclein as an anti-viral defense mechanism, which can trigger α-synucleinopthies (58). Dopaminergic neurons are more vulnerable to degeneration by this mechanism and promote α-synuclein uptake upon viral neuroinflammation.",
            "Increased α-synuclein levels restricts infection of the brain by RNA viruses following West Nile virus and SARS-CoV-1 infection (59). Due to the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to these other viruses, it is possible that a similar up-regulation of α-synuclein might occur with SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to widespread neurodegeneration (60).",
            "α-Synuclein is recognized by a number of toll-like receptors (TLRs) including TLR1-4,−7 and−8. TLRs detect pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) that accrue due to cell damage and can trigger a chronic inflammatory process (61, 62). α-Synuclein aggregation also leads to microglial activation, a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases (63), that further promotes neuronal damage and apoptosis by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic reactive oxygen intermediates (64).",
            "Hyposmia and gastrointestinal manifestations, which are common in SARS-CoV-2 infection, are non-motor symptoms of PD during the prodromal phase. It is in this phase of the disease that α-synuclein deposition within the anterior olfactory nucleus and neurodegeneration begins (65–67).",
            "Furthermore, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to physically interact with the mTOR translational repressor, La-Ribonucleoprotein 1 (LARP1) (68). LARP1 plays an important role in the autophagy, glucose metabolism and mitochondrial functions in the neurons of the brain (69).",
            "Brain hypoxia is another common feature among COVID-19 patients with respiratory distress. Hypoxia induces oxidative damage to neural cells and causes widespread neurodegeneration (70). Based on clinical data obtained from two cases reported by Jaunmuktane and colleagues, severe COVID-19 patients may be at a greater risk of microvascular injury and ischemic lesions due to presence of hypoxia (71).",
            "Acute hypoxemia may promote a hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and induce demyelination and production of white matter microhemorrhages. Furthermore, prolonged hypoxia may lead to BBB destruction and leaky capillaries, which promote cerebral microhemorrhages. The defective function and subsequent death of oligodendroglial cells is another consequence of a hypoxic microenvironment within the brain which, in turn, results in demyelination of white matter (72).",
            "Interestingly Hypoxia can impair metabolic pathways in the brain as well and activate immune cells that are usually maintained in a resting state during normoxia. The hypoxia microenvironment in the brain actives hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1α) which is a key regulator of oxygen homeostasis and triggers adoptive responses under hypoxic conditions (73). HIF-1α down regulates the expression of ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and so can exert a protective effect by blocking of the cell entry gate of SARS-CoV-2 (74, 75).",
            "However, the upregulation of HIF-1a may act as a double-edged sword during SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. HIF-1α mediates cytokine storm and mass production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6 at the inflammatory site and increases the transcription of M1 macrophage-associated genes such as TNF-α, IL-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase (INOS) at the site of inflammation. In addition, HIF-1α modulates the activation and life span of many immune cells including neutrophils and dendritic cells to promote M1 polarization (76).",
            "The cytokine storm triggers neuronal damage, epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis, vascular leakage and BBB disruption (77). In rare occasions the cytokine storm may lead to BBB disruption without direct viral invasion (78). Moreover, disruption of the peripheral BBB increases α-synuclein uptake from the circulation into the brain (Figure 1).",
            "Immunity cell activation and the cytokine storm are proposed as key mechanisms driving the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. For example, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), increased pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6 suppress the phagocytic activity of microglial cells and cause the accumulation and deposition of beta-amyloid A (79). In addition, increased levels of inflammatory mediators including TNF-α are found in the CSF and in brain tissue of patients with PD as well as in the non-human primate models of the disease (80). A similar pro-inflammatory pattern with increased IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α is seen in the CSF of MS patients and was associated with the severity of damage at the time of diagnosis (81). Interestingly, men with higher plasma levels of IL-6 have an increased risk of developing PD (67, 82). IL-6 is highly overexpressed in severe COVID-19 patients that may suggest a plausible therapeutic target to prevent the neurological consequences and brain damage seen in these patients.",
            "Although limiting viral replication leads to a rapid and effective immune response it needs to be tightly regulated to avoid tissue damage. Given the highly specialized functions and limited regenerative capacity of neurons, tight regulation of the CNS immune response is critical (3). The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 limits the expansion of tissue lesions during chronic viral infection of the CNS (83). Indeed, the pathologic process of virus-induced demyelination is alleviated by exogenous IL-10 early after disease onset and highlights its potential for the treatment of viral encephalitis and COVID-19 (84).",
            "CD8 T cells are the major source of IL-10 production in the airways following infection of murine models with influenza A virus (SV5) and respiratory syncytial virus (85, 86). IL-10 is produced transiently by CD8 T cells in the brain of coronavirus-infected mice at the peak of infection. The expression of IL-10 in CD8 T cells; requires a strong antigenic stimulation and signaling through the MAPK pathway. Thus, the production of IL-10 by highly activated CD8 T cells functions to suppress the localized imune response when the viral antigen concentration and inflammatory responses are increased which reduces immunopathological damage (87).",
            "T helper cells (CD4+ Tcells) can produce IL-10 following antigen stimulation and high T cell receptor (TCR) ligation (87). Development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells is dependent upon IL-12 stimulation via STAT4 and ERK-dependent pathways. Repeated TCR triggering leads to maximal levels of IL-10 production by Th1 cells (88). Futhermore, during high dose bacterial infection and during a cytokine storm, macrophages can produce high levels of IL-10 and miR-155 which orchestrate an inhibitory process protecting the host from immune cell-mediated damage (89). In the patients susceptible to a cytokine storm, macrophages and immune cells have significantly lower IL-10 and miR-155 expression following bacterial challenge (89).",
            "Systemic production of IL-10 following the onset of a cytokine storm may result in “immunoparalysis” that is associated with decreased number and reduced function of neutrophils and monocytes (90) in association with pyroptotic death of these cells (77, 91). In addition, the reduced peripheral blood lymphocyte count, that mainly reflects a loss of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients, is highly associated with the severity of disease. The mechanism underlying this process is unclear but it may be due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect T cells directly.",
            "However, patients that survive the initial cytokine storm may be unable to recover from immunoparalysis. COVID-19 patients with low monocyte surface expression of HLA-DR have a high mortality rate a few days after the onset of sepsis and the cytokine storm. Approaches to reverse immunosuppression should be considered in these patients (92).",
            "Viruses can break down the body's self-tolerance and trigger autoimmune reactions in predisposed individuals by multiple mechanisms including structural mimicking or bystander activation (93). Bystander activation is a common mechanism in neurological disorders. The persistent and hyperactive immune response to a viral infection may sequester and expose auto-antigens to the immune system resulting in a localized pro-inflammatory environment (93, 94). Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 may trigger the production of autoantibodies and develop autoinflammatory reactions in genetic predisposed individuals (95). For example, antiphospholipid (APL) antibodies (96), anti-52 kDa and anti-60 kDa anti–Sjögren's-syndrome-related antigen A autoantibodies (Ro-SSA) (97), antinuclear antibodies (ANA) (98) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) (99, 100) have all been detected in the serum of COVID-19 patients and which may induce future autoimmune disorders.",
            "In addition to the production of auto-antibodies, pre-existing antibodies also may complicate the pathologic condition. Autoimmune reactions can trigger the neurodegeneration process through autoantibodies mediated mechanisms (101). Immunoglobulins (IGs) or immune complexes can be neurotoxic by inducing proinflammatory responses in the brain parenchyma through microglial activation leading to neuronal damage (101, 102). For example IgG in lupus serum induces M1 polarization of brain microglia and inflammatory responses (103). Furthermore, patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases have a significantly higher risk of neurodegenerative diseases (104) and autoantibodies that target brain specific proteins have been found in the CSF of patients with AD (101, 105).",
            "An autoimmune background is also suggested for PD. In patients with PD, the presence of serum autoantibodies against catecholamine-based melanins have been identified and are responsible for the neuronal loss by autoimmune mechanisms (106). Furthermore, in MS the increased migration of auto-reactive lymphocytes across the BBB results in persistent neurodegeneration (107). Overall, the current evidence suggests that neuronal damage in COVID-19 patients might be secondary to the immune response due to the presence of autoantibodies rather than to a direct cytopathic effect of the virus (99).",
            "Some cases of Guillain-Barrè syndrome have been reported following SARS-CoV-2 infection (108, 109). Guillain-Barrè syndrome is an immune-mediated pathogenicity and mostly develops after a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection (110). Formation of cross-reacting anti-ganglioside antibodies is the major mechanism driving the demyelinating polyneuropathy or a motor axonal neuropathy (110, 111). Influenza A virus also triggers autoimmune CNS damage with the lung acting as an inflammatory niche in which auto-aggressive T cells gain the capacity to enter CNS (107). Thus, the persistence of the virus or of viral proteins may continue to stimulate the immune system and perpetuate chronic demyelination (112). Together, these findings suggest a potential link between neurological defects and autoimmune reactions upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, induced autoimmune reactions or the persistence of autoantibodies may exacerbate pathological states within the CNS.",
            "Current evidence suggests that pre-existing CNS comorbidities increase the severity and neurological damage of COVID-19. The association between neurological comorbidity and COVID-19 severity varies according to the presence of neurological disorders and patients with cerebrovascular and cognitive impairments have a higher severity of infection and a greater need for ICU admission (113, 114). Patients with MS exhibit an increased severity of disease and the infection contributes to disease relapses and/or the worsening of neurological manifestations (115, 116).",
            "Preexisting autoimmune diseases and the presence of autoantibodies could also complicate the inflammatory condition and promote brain injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection (96). The impaired BBB integrity in AD and MS patients may allow autoantibodies to more readily access the brain and trigger neuro-inflammation (101, 117). Pre-existing cardiovascular diseases also increase the neurological injuries induced by SARS-CoV-2 (118). ACE2 usage by the virus and receptor shedding reduced cell surface expression of ACE2 and endothelial dysfunction. Dysregulation of ACE2 enzymatic function may also lead to dysregulation of the brain renin-angiotensin system (B-RAS) whilst overexpression of Ang II and dysregulated blood pressure can impact on brain endothelial cell dysfunction (119). High levels of Ang II can also trigger an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and promote a cytokine storm within the brain (120). This suggests that the presence of cardiovascular comorbidities exacerbates these conditions and may account for the severe neurological injuries induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "Age also plays a determinant role in neurological injury since older individuals have reduced expression of ACE2 and higher levels of angiotensin II. SARS-CoV-2 infection may induce a severe inflammatory environment with increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines which can actively transfer to the CNS and activate glial neuroinflammatory responses and trigger neuronal damage (121, 122). Recent studies highlight the role of malnutrition and vitamin deficiency on the severity of disease. A low level of vitamin D is associated with COVID-19 severity and immune dysregulation that may impact upon neurological damage (123). Finally, the gut-brain axis may also contribute to the neurological comorbidity of COVID-19 since gut dysbiosis influences the formation of the cytokine storm within the brain (124). This suggests that improving the gut microbiota using probiotics may provide a novel opportunity to control neural damage induced by SARS-CoV-2.",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a wide range of pathophysiologies. Although SARS-CoV-2 is known primarily as a respiratory virus, a wide range of neurological symptoms have been associated with this virus. Alongside a neurotropic behavior and neuroinvasive properties, the virus may trigger neurological defects by triggering a cytokine storm.",
            "Pre-existing CNS comorbidities and autoimmune diseases place the patients at a higher risk for developing neurological symptoms upon infection. Although many biological parameters including age, the presence of cardiovascular diseases as well as malnutrition and vitamin deficiency are associated with COVID-19; a causal link has not yet been defined.",
            "Current evidence strongly suggests that patients surviving COVID-19 are at high risk for the subsequent development of neurological disease. There are concerns that even when the pandemic is over, SARS-CoV-2 might persist within the CNS and cause chronic and latent infection in a large proportion of the population including those who suffered only mild respiratory symptoms. Further studies are needed to investigate potential correlations between acute or mild COVID-19 infections and long-term neurological effects in the population.",

            "SARS-CoV-2 is an extremely infectious and transferrable virus that develops severe conditions like respiratory syndrome, high blood pressure and weakens the immune system. Coronavirus falls under the Coronaviridae family and Beta coronavirus genus. Affected individuals will encounter problems starting with fever followed by severe complications like SARS, ARDS, and many others. These SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV enter the host cells by the endosomal pathway, and about 16 non-structural proteins are involved in assembling the viral RNA synthesis complex. They possess a positive-sense single-stranded RNA, and about four major genes are mainly associated with the development of ASRD, SARS, and other respiratory problems.",

This highlights the identification of the above-mentioned genes that can be used as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and targeted drug delivery for treating the SARS-CoV-2 neurological symptoms and reducing inflammation in the brain.",
            "Coronavirus was first likely to emerge in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China. It is suspected that its transmission was from the animal host and then spread to humans (Zhu et al. 2020). SARS-CoV-2 matches 79% to SARS-CoV and 50% to MERS-CoV, it even has a high genetic similarity with bat CoV (RaTG13), but bats are not a primary source coronavirus. Common symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are fever, cough, and sore throat (Poon et al. 2005). This virus is highly contagious and can transmit faster. According to the laws of IHR, 2005, declared a PHEIC because the spread was among 18 countries on January 30, 2020 (Cascella et al. 2020). CoV belongs to Nidovirales order, a family of Coronaviridae and Orthocoronavirinae subfamily; it is divided further into four groups according to genera are as follows: alpha (α), beta (β), gamma (γ), delta (δ) (Fig. 1) (Fehr and Perlman 2015). The purpose of this article is to explain the prevalence, risk factors, life cycle, structure, genetic aspects, and significant genes involved and associated with SARS-CoV-2.Fig. 1Hierarchy of Nidovirales",

The severity and adverse effects increased gradually, so WHO declared it as a pandemic (Worldwide) on March 11, 2020 (Al-Tawfiq et al. 2020). The more familiar manifestation among the affected individuals is fever followed by several associated complications like diarrhea and severe body pain, which leads to the cruelty of the infection (Hu et al. 2020). Beginning (March 3, 2020), 73 countries, territories, or areas worldwide had been encountered this infection and affected about 90,870 individuals. Studies say that these pandemics may be related to bats, but it takes their sole origin from the Wuhan Huanan seafood market (Ge et al. 2020).",

            "The life cycle of the novel coronavirus begins with the arrival of the virion into the cell that is being invaded. The cell entry is facilitated by glycoprotein spikes present in the structure SARS-COVID and binds with the receptors of the host cell, and the process is called host cell recognition. The ability to withstand the new host cell environment and to escape from the human immune system is also provided by the spikes (Kirchdoerfer et al. 2018; Perlman and Netland 2009). The cellular proteases like Cathepsins, the human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), TMPRSS2 facilitates the entry of these virions by separating the spike proteins and further building up additional perforation changes (Glowacka et al. 2011; Bertram et al. 2011) (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Life cycle of SARS-CoV-2",

After entering the cell, the RNA gets uncoated, and two replicase polyproteins are obtained by translation of the replicase gene present on the RNA strand. Also, the unique proteins of replicase enzymes are obtained by further processing the proteinases of the virus. Moreover, these proteins result in full-length RNA of negative sense, which is further reproduced to distribute shorter mRNAs (Song et al. 2019). Then, the genomic RNA and the viral proteins are further assembled into virions in the Golgi bodies and endoplasmic reticulum, and the vesicles help in the transportation of these particles and are released outside the cell.

            "COVID-19 possesses an ssRNA (positive sense) linked with a nucleoprotein inside a capsid consisting of matrix protein. It consists of the largest genome (26.4–31.7 kb) than other viruses known till now (Mousavizadeh and Ghasemi 2020). Previous studies propose that ARDS is more likely to be developed in all instances, such as in MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (Ding et al. 2003). In numerous patients, the genes like TNF, ACE2, IL-10, and VEGF are considered to be involved with the progress of ARDS (Meyer and Christie 2013).

Gene interaction with environmental factors like smoking and lifestyle activities is considered. Also, there is a high susceptibility of COVID-19. In COVID-19 infection, SARS-CoV is suspected of playing a significant role in genetic predisposition because it matches 80 percent of the genetic identity (Darbeheshti and Rezaei 2020).",

            "IL-2 encodes a protein that secretes cytokine produced by activated CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes essential for the T and B lymphocytes proliferation (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). For B cells and T cells, and cytotoxic cells, IL-2 is a central mediator for growth and development, including natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer cells (Kasprzak and Olejniczak 2008). For proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, SARS-CoV-2 infection can be a potent inducer of IL-7. In association with the severity of disease for COVID-19, circulating cytokines and chemokines have been found (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). IL-7 plays a hectic role in the immune system's homeostasis, and it helps increase the healthspan by altering the immune system (Nguyen et al. 2017). This gene encodes a cytokine protein produced by monocytes primarily and a very few extents by lymphocytes and has a pleiotropic effect in immune-regulation and inflammation (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). One of the required anti-inflammatory cytokines is IL-10; it plays a crucial role as a negative regulator to immune responses for microbial antigens. During the response to proinflammatory signals, immune cells can produce IL-10, and it also functions when there is excessive inflammation when infected (Iyer and Cheng xxxx). In severely sick COVID-19 patients, cytokine storm syndrome was examined, and it was reported that the extent of interleukins (IL-2, IL-7, IL-10) was high in fundamentally sick patients (Zwirner and Domaica 2010).",

It has a unique identity to human angiotensin one changing over chemical protein act as an active spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the objective agent of COVID-19. The emitted protein catalyzes the cleavage of angiotensin one into angiotensin 1–9, and angiotensin II is converted into the vasodilator angiotensin 1–7. ACE2 is known to be communicated in various organs of the human body (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). It has been accounted that ACE2 is the fundamental host cell receptor of 2019-nCoV and assumes a vital job in the passage of infection into the cell to cause the last contamination. Single-cell transcriptomes from free information created in-house were utilized to distinguish and affirm the ACE2-communicating cell synthesis and extent in the oral cavity (Wu et al. 2020). The outcomes exhibited that the ACE2 communicated on the mucosa of the oral cavity. For SARS-CoV-2, the essential receptor is ACE2 (in vivo); contaminations and the S proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus diminish ACE2 articulation (Xu et al. 2020).",
            "These genes are the component of the TNF ligand superfamily that encodes for a proinflammatory cytokine, of which macrophages are mainly associated with these cytokine secretions and their specified locus on human chromosome 6p21.3 (El-Tahan et al. 2016). They get bound with similar TNF receptors and result in similar pleiotropic effects; many pathological processes are correlated with these types of the gene, including cell proliferation, cell death, immune regulation, and inflammatory responses (Boraska et al. 2010). The levels of TNF-α were found similarly higher in aged or older patients than others, and exhaustion in T cell checks is seen, which demonstrates that this TNF-α is a sort of negative regulator for the proliferation of T cells (Diao et al. 2019a). The plasma proportions of this TNF are found higher in SARS-COV-2-infected patients, and their concentrations are based on the severity of infection, which means higher concentrations are seen in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients (Diao et al. 2019a). The primary synthesizers of TNF called the macrophages are seen to a greater extent in the infected individuals; thus, these elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines called the TNF are observed; in some patients, it turns out to be a cytokine storm (Soy et al. 2020). So different TNF blocking antibodies like etanercept, adalimumab, etc., are effectively employed to treat inflammatory diseases, and now these treatments are suggested for earnest requirements toward the COVID patients (Channappanavar et al. 2016).",
            "Eight conserved cysteines distinguish these genes; they also represent homodimer structures and functions. These are the protein types found with vascular permeability actions and are further subdivided into VEGF-A, B, C, D, E, PlGF, and Trimeresurus flavoviridis svVEGF (Shibuya 2011). This VEGF performs a prime part in maintaining the growth, improvement, and maintenance of a healthy circulatory system, thereby ensuring normal angiogenesis (Ruggiero et al. 2011). They get bound with VEGFR and perform a top part in the activating endothelial cell. The alveolar immune regulation is maintained by the integrity of the endothelial barrier in lung tissue which is crucial in COVID-affected patients (Zhang et al. 2020). In the SARS-CoV-2-affected individuals, the serum levels of VEGF are found to be elevated. However, there is not much difference in these VEGF levels between ICU and non-ICU patients (Huang et al. 2020). VEGF is mainly associated with ALI and ARDS and is believed to be a prime factor for their cause; since the proportions of these genes are found elevated in the COVID-19-infected persons, they may lead to acute lung and respiratory syndromes in affected individuals (Turkia). These VEGFs perform a decisive part in brain inflammation (which results in neurological defects) and is identified as a promising therapeutic agent in suppressing the inflammation that is caused by COVID infection (Yin et al. 2020; Rodríguez-Puertas 2020).",

Expression in the ACE-2 gene affects the brain areas' function; IL-2, IL-7, IL-10 gene expression negatively regulates the transformation growth factor-β, alteration in TNF gene depletes the T lymphocytes, and VEGF gene expression causes the edema by the extravasation of immune cells (Table 3).Table 3Significant genes with their expression on SARS-CoV-2S. no.Major genesComplications1ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)IT affects CNS and infects certain brain areas entering the olfactory bulb and thereby leading to loss of olfaction (Yin et al. 2020; Rodríguez-Puertas 2020)2IL-2, IL-7, and IL-10 (interleukins)Autoimmune and immunostimulatory effects (Rodríguez-Puertas 2020).

            "Significant genes with their expression on SARS-CoV-2",
            "SARS-CoV-2, which falls under the family of Coronaviridae, is highly contagious and has a higher rate of human–human transmission; the required method of transmission is through inhaling the droplets or coming in direct contact with virus surfaces. COVID-19 is a high risk to the population and healthcare workers worldwide. Many ideas for therapeutic options and vaccine development have been initiated, and also few countries have started to test the vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The four genes mentioned above contribute to the susceptibility of COVID-19, even though other factors influence, but genetic factors have a crucial role in disease severity. It is essential to emphasize the current issue with COVID-19 in which various genes show a positive correlation. As per the study conducted by a genome-wide association consisting of 1980 persons and they are infected with COVID-19 and other respiratory conditions, they have analyzed 8,582,968 SNP’s. The conclusion was made that gene cluster 3p21.31 is a genetic susceptibility in patients affected by the virus (Zhu et al. 2020). Hence, this assessment highlights the significant genes that focus on genetic changes and levels; ACE2 is a causative agent for coronavirus, and IL-2, 7, 10, TNF, and VEGF are involved in cytokine storm inflammatory response. These four genes are under study for coronavirus biology so that these genes may be used as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and used for targeted drug delivery for COVID-19.",
            "This study encompassed the abnormal changes in the genes caused by the SARS-CoV-2 and pointed out the significant genes affected by this novel virus with the complete metabolic pathways. It is found that cytokines such as IL2, IL7, and IL10 play an essential role in maximizing the seriousness of the SARS-CoV-2. The ACE2 enzyme and VEGF affect the brain and cause inflammation in the central nervous system. The purpose of this review is to bring down the seriousness of the SARS-CoV-2. It is better to target the cytokines for the possible results, and for treating the SARS-CoV-2 neurological symptoms, VEGF is a probable therapeutic target in reducing inflammation in the brain. Therefore, this review could benefit not only for this virus's therapeutic basis but also for clinical observing, identification, and mediation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the future.",

            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). About 45% of COVID-19 patients experience several symptoms a few months after the initial infection and develop post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), referred to as “Long-COVID,” characterized by persistent physical and mental fatigue. However, the exact pathogenetic mechanisms affecting the brain are still not well-understood. There is increasing evidence of neurovascular inflammation in the brain. However, the precise role of the neuroinflammatory response that contributes to the disease severity of COVID-19 and long COVID pathogenesis is not clearly understood. Here, we review the reports that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can cause blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and damage neurons either directly, or via activation of brain mast cells and microglia and the release of various neuroinflammatory molecules. Moreover, we provide recent evidence that the novel flavanol eriodictyol is particularly suited for development as an effective treatment alone or together with oleuropein and sulforaphane (ViralProtek®), all of which have potent anti-viral and anti-inflammatory actions.",
            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), leading to complex immune responses [1,2] that involve the release of several inflammatory cytokines/chemokines [1,3,4,5,6,7,8], especially interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) [9] and IL-6, often referred to as “cytokine exacerbated production” [3,10,11]. Almost 50 percent of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) [12,13,14] shortly after the initial infection [15], known as “Long-COVID syndrome” [16,17,18]. A recent report indicated that about 45% of COVID-19 survivors showed persistent symptoms at about 4 months in post COVID-19 population, with fatigue being most frequently experienced in hospitalized and non-hospitalized cohorts [14]. Long COVID is characterized by persistent fatigue that is not dependent on the initial severity of the disease [19] and presents with persistent symptomatology many months post-acute infection [20]. At least 20–45 percent of COVID-19 survivors experience various neuropsychiatric [14,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33], neurological [34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42] and neurodegenerative [37,43] issues, sleep disturbances [44], and cognitive deficits [28,29,30,31,32,33,45,46,47,48], especially brain fog [16,17,49,50,51,52,53,54,55]. The length of long COVID may depend on the persistence of some viral antigens [56] and the magnitude of continued inflammatory reactions to SARS-CoV-2 [57]. Long COVID has been considered as the “Next national health disaster” for the US [58] that could have a “$3.7 trillion economic impact rivaling the Great Depression” [59].",
            "A systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE data base (1 January 1990–1 January 2023) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis, pathogenesis and treatment of neuro-COVID using the search terms angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), blood-brain barrier (BBB), brain, chemokines, corona virus, COVID-19, cytokines, endothelial cells, fatigue, fog, inflammation, Long-COVID, mast cell, microglia, neuroinflammation, toll-like receptors, and vasculature. Emphasis was placed on publications reporting original data, especially in humans, even though reviews and papers using animal models were also included.",
            "We advance the premise that brain perivascular inflammation is a critical pathogenetic factor in long COVID mostly due to SARS-CoV-2 activating brain mast cells and microglia resulting in the release of inflammatory, neurotoxic, and vasoactive mediators [60,61].",
            "The precise mechanism of long COVID pathogenesis has yet to be fully elucidated [62]. It is well-understood that SARS-CoV-2 enters cells through the coronavirus spike (S) protein binding to its cell surface receptor, ACE2 [63]. How SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain is not yet clearly known, but increased levels of cytokines were reported in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with COVID-19 [64,65]. The virus may enter the brain from the nose through the nasal neural mucosa [66] following the olfactory nerve tract [67] or via the gustatory–olfactory trigeminal pathway and cause BBB dysfunction.",
            "Autopsy from a deceased infant with COVID-19 showed severe neuronal loss in the capillaries of the choroid plexus [68]. Another autopsy study detected choroid plexus morphological changes in the microglia [69,70], as well as neuronal necrosis and glial cell hyperplasia in the brain of a deceased patient with COVID-19 [71]. While the exact pathogenetic mechanisms [50] remain unclear, evidence points to the involvement of neuroinflammation [72,73,74], and neurovascular inflammation that can damage brain blood vessels [75,76] and brain cells [72,77,78].",
            "The neurological issues of long COVID [79] may be attributed to the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the brain [80], but the routes of viral entry are not yet clear [81]. The S protein is involved in the fusion of the viral membrane with the surface membrane of the host. The S trimer structure has three receptor-binding domains (RBD), while the post-fusion structure expresses N-linked glycans that may protect the immune system [82]. Recent evidence and our studies indicate that the spike protein can also directly activate microglia [83,84,85], leading to proinflammatory effects [86] and microglia–synapse elimination [87]. SARS-CoV-2 can also lead to brain vascular damage and endothelial dysfunction [88,89,90,91], BBB disruption [92,93,94,95,96,97,98] and reduced blood flow to the brain [99]. A recent study reported that neuroinflammation could disrupt the “blood-central nervous system (CNS) barrier” in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS) that involved the interaction of inflammatory, endothelial, and mesenchymal pathways [100]. Perivascular inflammation with lymphocytic and microglial infiltration was noted in the brains of 52 deceased patients with COVID-19 [101]. A cross-sectional study identified BBB disruption along with increased microglial activation markers and increased B-cell responses against self and non-self-antigens [102]. Another study with 24 neuro-COVID patients also reported increased intrathecal immunoglobulin, neopterin, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels [103]. Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) has been associated with COVID-19 [104,105,106] and with severe COVID-19 [100,101]. In fact, ApoE4 could possibly predict COVID-19 pathogenesis [107]. In particular, ApoErs429358 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection [108]. Elevated ApoE4 levels were reported to also reflect BBB disruption and predict cognitive decline [109].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to activate toll-like receptors (TLRs) [110,111] leading to the release of immune molecules that could contribute to neurologic symptoms [112]. TLRs are important in recognizing viral particles and orchestrate innate immune responses. Viral activation of TLRs causes the release of inflammatory cytokines from immune cells [113]. Microglia have many receptors, including TLRs [114], and they are activated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [114]. TLRs were recently shown to mediate COVID-19 pathogenesis [115]. One paper reported that SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein could produce inflammatory cytokines from mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages via TLR2 activation, independent of viral entry [116]. Another study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein could stimulate BV-2 microglia leading to the release of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) with increased expression of TLR4 [84]. Another paper reported that infection of HMC3 microglia also led to the release of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α [83]. Moreover, activation of TLR4 increased the expression of ACE2 [117], further enhancing viral infectivity in an autocrine loop fashion. In fact, TLR4 has been considered as a therapeutic target for neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection [118,119]. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, have been detected in the CSF of COVID-19 patients [65] and have been implicated in neurologic diseases associated with COVID-19 [64]. Our recent findings show that SARS-CoV-2 can stimulate human microglia to secrete distinct pro-inflammatory mediators via activation of different receptors: recombinant whole-length S protein results in secretion of IL-1β and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8) not via activation of ACE2, but rather activation of TLR-4, while the recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein stimulates the release of IL-18, TNF-α, and S100B via ACE2 [120].",
            "Microglia are specialized macrophage-like immune cells of the CNS and constitute about 7 percent of non-neuronal cells in the brain [121]. It has been reported that one microglial cell serves 1 to 100 neuronal cells in various brain areas with different neuronal densities [121]. Microglia are important for CNS homeostasis both in health and disease states [122], especially neurodegenerative [123,124,125,126,127,128,129] and neuroinflammatory [122,128,130,131] diseases, including COVID-19 [83,132]. During neuroinflammatory response and brain homeostasis maintenance, microglia can change their numbers, morphological characteristics, molecular pattern, and functions [132]. Activated microglia release pro-inflammatory cytokines, free radicals, and fatty acid metabolites. Cytokines and chemokines released from activated microglia induce activation of astrocytes with additional release of proinflammatory mediators that further exacerbates neuroinflammatory response. Dysregulated microglia and T-cell interactions and microglial nodules in the perivascular compartment of the brain were associated with systemic inflammatory conditions in COVID-19 [133]. Microglial activation is significantly higher in the brain stem than in non-COVID cases. Further, COVID-19 cases without dementia show more microglial activation in the brain stem [134,135]. The neuroinflammatory response is indicated by the presence of microglial reactivity indicators such as CD68-positive ameboid microglia, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1), and human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) in COVID-19 [132,134]. COVID-19 shows more T lymphocytes and microthromboses in the lung associated with more microglial activation in the brain stem [135]. In other words, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 could be due to persistent inflammation rather than persistent viral replication [135]. SARS-CoV-2 induces neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders such as cognitive decline, depression, dizziness, delirium, and sleep disorders that lead to neuronal damage, neurodegenerative disorders, and dementia [136]. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can cause BBB disruption and worsen neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease, especially in aged people [136,137,138].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis [139], which may be the cause of the emotional changes observed during and after viral infection [140]. Several reports have shown the impact of the pandemic on acute and chronic mental health. Further, these studies also focused on the psycho-social factors and stress resilience of mental health and disease pathologies [141,142]. TLR4 contributes to the immune response and pathogenesis of COVID-19, and thus, TLR4 could be a therapeutic target in COVID-19 [113,143,144]. SARS CoV-2 activates TLR4 and 8 and induces cytokine release from microglia and monocytes [145]. Microglia express receptors for neurotensin (NT) [146] and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), secreted under stress [147], which are especially associated with COVID-19 [148]. Microglia are typically characterized as resting (M0), pro-inflammatory (M1), and anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective (M2) phenotypes with different cytokine expressions associated with neuroinflammatory response. We reported that cultured human microglia can be activated by neuropeptides such as NT to release IL-1β and CXCL8 [149] that induces proinflammatory response. Microglial-derived proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines induce astrogliosis, amyloid deposition, and subsequently, further worsening neuroinflammation [122]. Psychological stress can increase microglial reactivity to other challenges [150] and lead to cognitive decline [151] and neuroinflammatory response.",
            "Microglia are increasingly involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders [132,152,153]. In fact, microglia-induced neuroinflammation was considered a risk factor for the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder [154,155]. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism may increase the severity of neuropsychiatric issues [156]. A recent report indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 protein elicited a robust nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)/nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-mediated pro-inflammatory response and increased Iba1 expression in a BV-2 mouse microglial cell line [84]. In addition, post-mortem reports of COVID-19 patients showed significant microglial activation and neuroinflammation associated with brain pathology [157,158,159,160]. Increasing reports indicate that elevated inflammatory cytokines and neuroinflammatory responses [72,128,161] can damage brain blood vessels [75,162] and other brain cells [72,77,78], possibly through abnormally excessive activation of microglia [60,61]. As such, long COVID could be referred to as “brain autoimmunity” [163].",
            "Mast cells communicate with microglia [32,164], leading to their activation [33,164,165,166] and contributing to neuroinflammation [32,33] and neurodegenerative diseases [32,167]. This effect is not seen in mast-cell-deficient mice [168,169]. In fact, mast cell proteases can trigger astrocytes and glia/neurons and release IL-33 [170]. Stabilization of mast cells was shown to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation by suppressing the activation of microglia [171]. Activation of mast cells and microglia in the hypothalamus and brain [172] could lead to cognitive dysfunction [173] and neuronal apoptosis (Figure 1) [173]. In addition, mast cells can activate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis [174,175,176,177] through the release of histamine [178], IL-6 [179], and CRH [180]. It is interesting that stress has been linked to the possible priming of immune cells thus contributing to neuroinflammation in AD [181,181]. Furthermore, NT [182,183] and substance P (SP) [2] induce CRH receptor-1 (CRHR1) expression in mast cells. Mast-cell-derived histamine [184] and tryptase [185] can trigger microglia and induce neuroinflammation [33]. Mast cells have been shown to be an early activator of LPS-induced neuroinflammation and BBB damage in the hippocampus [172]. In addition, food allergy that depends on mast cell activation has been shown to increase activated microglia and TNF in the hippocampus, associated with behavioral and learning impairments [186]. Another paper reported that early stress in mice and humans disrupted interactions between mast cells and glia via the involvement of histamine [187]. As such, mast cells can participate in neuroinflammation [188,189] by releasing histamine and several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [190].",
            "Mast cells are ubiquitous in the body [191]. They are mostly known for mediating allergic and anaphylactic reactions [192], and several other diseases such as mastocytosis [193]. The functions of mast cells in health and several pathologic conditions were reviewed recently [194,195,196,197]. Mast cells respond to allergic but also to various other non-allergic stimuli [193]. Activated mast cells can secrete as many as 100 biologically powerful mediators, including pro-inflammatory molecules [190] such as bradykinin, chymase, histamine, tryptase, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), CXCL8 [198], IL-6 [199], IL-1β, and TNF-α [200]. A particular potent stimulus of the mast cells is the peptide SP, especially when primed by the “alarmin” cytokine IL-33 [201,202,203,204]. In addition, we showed that SP can induce expression of the IL-33 receptor (ST2) [200], thus further increasing mast cell stimulation. Mast cells can also be stimulated to secrete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [205], which serves as an additional “alarmin” and can trigger an auto-inflammatory reaction [206,207]. Mast cells are also found in the CNS perivascularly [29,208], especially in the meninges [28,209] and the median eminence of the hypothalamus [122,209,210], where they could have numerous functions (Table 1). We have called brain mast cells the “immune gate to the brain” [29]. Functional interactions have been reported between mast cells and neurons [209,211] that are often positive for CRH [183,209]. Mast cells are the richest source of histamine in the CNS, particularly in the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and thalamus [212,213]. Stimulated brain mast cells contribute to postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) through the release of inflammatory and neurotoxic mediators from activated microglia [86,173]. Activation of mast cells [183] and microglia in the hypothalamus [49] could cause cognitive dysfunction [173] that is also seen in patients with mastocytosis [47,214,215] and may be related to brain abnormalities [216]. Allergic stimulation of nasal mast cells resulted in stimulation of the HPA axis [174,175,176,177], possibly via mast cell release of histamine [178], IL-6 [178,217], and CRH [180]. The influence of stress on mast cells has also been reviewed [140,218]. Restraint stress in rodents increased BBB permeability [210,219,220] via CRH [219,221,222]. Mast-cell-released cytokines [223,224] increased BBB permeability [210,219] and permitted mammary adenocarcinoma brain metastases in mice [221]. This process could worsen with stress, acting via CRH stimulation of mast cells [219,221] and an increase in dura vascular permeability. Meningeal mast cells affected the integrity of the BBB and promoted T-cell brain infiltration [225]. Inflammation mediated by mast cells and microglia disrupted the BBB [226]. Mast cell responsiveness may be regulated not only by the neuroimmune stimuli but also by the effects of the different receptors involved. For instance, mast cells express high-affinity neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptors for SP [2]. Moreover, SP and NT [182] induced the expression of CRHR-1 in human mast cells. Secretion of mediators can occur by utilizing different signaling [227,228,229,230] and secretory [228,230] pathways. The regulation of mast cells by neurotransmitters and neuropeptides has been reviewed [231,232,233], with emphasis on CRH [177], hemokinin-1 (HK-1) [234], nerve growth factor (NGF [235], NT [236], SP [237], and somatostatin [238,239] acting via activation of high-affinity receptors. Activated mast cells could release a number of pro-inflammatory and vasoactive mediators that could contribute to long COVID syndrome symptoms [177,240]. Some mediators are pre-stored in secretory granules (e.g., histamine, tryptase, and TNF-α) [241,242] and are released immediately following stimulation, while others are newly synthesized and then released, such as chemokines (e.g., CCL2, CCXL8) [198], and cytokines (IL-6 [199], IL-1β [243], TNF-α [200]). Apart from allergic triggers acting via IgE, mast cells are stimulated by non-allergic agents [192,203,244], especially neuropeptides [231], such as SP [237,243] and the SP-related HK-1 [234], which have pro-inflammatory properties. Under such conditions, especially when primed by IL-33 [203,204], mast cells can release various inflammatory mediators without the release of histamine or tryptase [245], thus contributing to inflammatory disorders [189,192]. Moreover, mouse mast-cell proteases 6 (MMCP 6) and MMCP 7 stimulated the release of IL-33 from mouse fetal-brain-derived cultured primary astrocytes in vitro [170]. A case in point is the selective release of IL-6 [199,246], which is elevated in systemic mastocytosis and correlated with disease severity [247,248,249] and can increase mast cell numbers [250].",
            "Mast cells are activated by viruses [251,252] such as SARS-CoV-2 [17,18,20,53,55,57,253,254,255,256,257,258,259,260,261]. Recent studies have also reported mast cell activation in the lungs [254] and perivascular inflammation in the brains [75] of COVID-19 patients. We hypothesized that the spike protein can get into the brain either directly or through the activation of mast cells, which then disrupts the integrity of the BBB (Figure 1) [79]. Two studies reported elevated serum levels of chymase in patients with COVID-19 [253,260]. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that mast cells enhance cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 through the generation of chymase-spike complexes [52]. Chymase converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and may act in an autocrine fashion to increase the expression of ACE2, which then facilitate viral entry. Another paper reported that mast-cell-derived histamine can increase SARS-CoV-2 entry into endothelial cells [90]. Mast cells also release extracellular mtDNA [205], which was shown to be significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients [262]. Extracellular mtDNA can then stimulate the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators from other immunocytes [206,207].",
            "While a number of molecules are elevated in the blood of patients with COVID-19 [34,35,36,263], the results have been inconsistent and have focused primarily on pro-inflammatory mediators. A few studies have investigated blood biomarkers that may reflect brain injury in COVID-19 patients [264,265]. Anti-receptor antibodies and autoimmune gene expression [266] have also been reported. IL-15 is implicated in viral clearance with anti-viral properties, including in COVID-19 [267,268]. We showed elevated IL-18 in the serum of patients with COVID-19 [269]. IL-18 remains elevated longer than other cytokines in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders [270,271], including COVID-19 [269]. Calprotectin (S100A8/A9) was associated with microglia activation [272] and was elevated in the serum of patients with COVID-19 [269]. Calprotectin was also in the CSF of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) [273] and demyelinating polyneuropathy [274]. Neuroligins (NLGs) and neurexins are implicated in synaptic function and cognitive disease [275]. NLG1 levels were reduced in the cortex and the CSF of AD patients [276] or those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [277]. NLG4 was associated with cognitive decline [278], while neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) was shown to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry by binding to the spike protein [279]. Moreover, S100β was shown to be associated with COVID-19 severity [280] and promote microglia activation [281,282,283] and has been linked to neuroinflammation and cognitive decline [284]. Neurofilament light chain (NfL), microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) indicate axonal/neuronal damage and brain injury [264,285,286,287,288]. Elevated levels of osteopontin have been associated with reduced cognition [289,290]. A recent study indicated that COVID-19 was associated with brain pathology in the UK Biobank [291] and was associated with neuroinflammation involving primarily the chemokine CCL11 in a mouse model [292]. CCL11 has been implicated in neuroinflammatory disorders [293], while osteopontin was reported to disrupt the BBB [294]. Chemokine CCL19 and its receptor C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) axis are involved in the immune response to viral infections [268,295]. Increased levels of CCL19 were associated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients [296].",
            "To date, there are no effective drugs to either treat long COVID or mitigate the release of inflammatory mediators from microglia. Understanding how neuro-immune and toxic triggers contribute to long COVID and how to regulate this response is of clinical importance (Figure 2). One of the major impediments has been the lack of appropriate disease surrogates either in vivo or in vitro [297], as well as the lack of effective inhibitors of neuroinflammation. Apparently, there have been therapeutic considerations of “stabilizing” the BBB [226,298].",
            "For inflammation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) did not improve COVID-19 [297]. Biologics have also been tried in COVID-19. Even though IL-6 has been reported to be elevated and possibly an independent risk factor, clinical trials using IL-6 inhibitors did not show any consistent benefit in COVID-19 [299]. One study reported that a clinically available IL-1β antagonist significantly improved COVID-19 with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH) that was characterized by pancytopenia, hyper-coagulation, and acute kidney injury [300]. Glucocorticoids have been used extensively in severe, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [301], but the results are confusing. One paper reported a reduction in mechanical ventilation and a 20 percent reduction in the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients but also longer hospital stays and longer viral clearance time [302]. A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed a trend toward a higher discharge rate, but the effect was minimal and not significant [301]. Another analysis of 16 randomized control trials reported that systemic corticosteroids slightly reduced 30-day mortality in severe patients, but there was no benefit up to 120 days [303]. A multicenter observational cohort study conducted in 55 Spanish intensive care units reported that early administration of high doses of dexamethasone since symptom onset could actually prove harmful for 90-day mortality [304]. In fact, it has been argued that even though glucocorticosteroids may improve outcomes in severe, intubated patients with COVID-19, they could also reduce the production of antiviral IgG antibodies [305], thus hampering protection from other infections and worsening long-term outcomes [306].",
            "Inhibition of brain inflammation could instead be accomplished with the use of some natural flavonoids [79,307,308,309,310,311,312]. In particular, the flavone luteolin inhibits both microglia [149,313,314] and mast cells [315,316], as well as related inflammatory processes [147,311]. A novel luteolin analogue, tetramethoxyluteolin [147], can inhibit secretion of the cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α [149], as well as the chemokines CCL2 and CCL5 [198], from human microglia [149,314] and mast cells [220,299]. Flavonoids have been reported to prevent neuroinflammation [311,312,317,318], provide neuroprotection [311,318,319,320,321], and reduce cognitive dysfunction [322,323,324,325,326], especially brain fog [48,327,328]. However, flavonoids are difficult to dissolve in aqueous solutions and also have poor oral absorption and bioavailability. Two formulations containing liposomal luteolin (BrainGain® and FibroProtek® were successfully used to treat a severe COVID-19 patient with brain fog [329]. We have identified a novel flavonoid that is structurally similar to luteolin, the flavanone eriodictyol [330,331,332], which is also partially water-soluble and may be particularly suited for development as an effective treatment (Figure 2) because of its multiple beneficial actions (Table 2) [333,334,335]. A new and novel dietary supplement (ViralProtek®) combines eriodictyol [334,335,336,337] with oleuropein from olive leaves [338,339,340] and sulforaphane from broccoli [341] and was recently shown to have strong coronavirus inhibitory properties.",

            "Currently, the third and fourth waves of the coronavirus disease -19 (COVID-19) pandemic are creating havoc in many parts of the world. Although vaccination programs have been launched in most countries, emerging new strains of the virus along with geographical variations are leading to varying success rates of the available vaccines. The presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension is responsible for increasing the severity of COVID-19 and, thus, the COVID-19 mortality rate. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for entry into host cells, is widely expressed in the lungs, kidneys, testes, gut, adipose tissue, and brain. Infection within host cells mediates RAS overactivation, which leads to a decrease in the ACE2/ACE ratio, AT2R/AT1R ratio, and MasR/AT1R ratio. Such imbalances lead to the development of heightened inflammatory responses, such as cytokine storms, leading to post-COVID-19 complications and mortality. As the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hypertension remains unclear, this report provides an overview of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on patients with hypertension. We discuss here the interaction of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2, focusing on neuronal ACE2 (nACE2), and further shed light on the possible involvement of nACE2 in hypertension. SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain through neuronal ACE2 and spreads in various regions of the brain. The effect of viral binding to neuronal ACE2 in areas of the brain that regulate salt/water balance and blood pressure is also discussed in light of the neural regulation of hypertension in COVID-19.",
            "The COVID-19 causative agent SARS-CoV-2 not only infects the upper respiratory tract but also spreads to the brain in many patients [1]. Recently, several clinical studies have shown that the presence of one or more comorbidities is associated with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Hypertension is recognized as one of the most fatal comorbidities, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and kidney failure [2–4].",
            "The binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) facilitates its transmission into host cells [5]. These ACE2 proteins are the master regulators of the local and central renin-angiotensin system (RAS). ACE2 catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin-(1–9) and angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin-(1–7) [6–9]. An imbalance in the ACE2/ACE ratio can occur due to reduced activity of ACE2 or increased activity of ACE. Consequently, increased AngII induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increases the expression of cyclooxygenase enzymes. The increased activity of the ACE/AngII/AT1R axis or the decreased activity of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/MasR axis generates pulmonary and neurogenic hypertension and therefore may lead to thrombosis, causing cardiovascular complications culminating in lung damage, heart failure, multiorgan failure and hemorrhage [10, 11]. Recently, clinical studies reported the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 to other organ systems, including the brain. Clinicians raised concerns that neuropathology inflicted by the virus may also contribute to peripheral effects.",
            "The mechanisms of neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV-2 were obscure until Moriguchi et al. reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of COVID-19 patients [12]. Neuronal ACE2 (nACE2) is present in different parts of the brain, such as the subfornical organ (SFO), area postrema (AP), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNX), nucleus of tractus solitarius (NTS) and rostroventrolateral medulla (RVLM) (Fig. 1A) [13]. The possibility is raised that the presence of nACE2 may play a facilitatory role in the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 [14, 15]. However, whether the neuroinvasive and neurotropic capabilities of SARS-CoV-2 owing to the presence of nACE2 in certain parts of the brain contribute to the neural control of hypertension remains to be determined. The overwhelming morbidity due to COVID-19 in patients suffering from heart diseases and hypertension warrants a systematic discussion on the unusual nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clarity in understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2-induced neurogenic hypertension is crucial in the development of therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 patient management.Fig. 1Schematic representation of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the generation of neurogenic hypertension. A Neuronal ACE2 expression in different parts of the brain, such as the subfornical organ (SFO), area postrema (AP), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNX), nucleus of tractus solitarius (NTS), and rostroventrolateral medulla (RVLM). B SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion is facilitated by its binding to neuronal ACE2 present on neurons, that leads to inflammatory response induction, such as increased secretion of chemokines and cytokines, as well as increased ROS levels. This not only can lead to alterations in neuronal function but also can alter baroreceptor reflex activity, that in turn leads to the development of hypertension",

            "In humans, the 40 kb ACE2 gene is located on chromosome Xp22, which comprises of 20 introns and 18 exons. ACE2 is a type I transmembrane protein composed of 805 amino acids. At the N-terminus, ACE2 contains a peptidase domain (PD), and at the C-terminus, a collectrin-like domain is present. Structurally, ACE2 carries only a single catalytic domain that possesses a zinc-binding metallopeptidase motif (HEXXH). ACE2 catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin-(1–9) [8]. In addition, ACE2 converts angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1–7) [8]. Functionally, this enzyme may exist in two forms: a membrane-bound form and a soluble form. These membrane-bound ACE2 proteins are ubiquitous and are distributed across organs and tissues such as the lung parenchyma, brain, nasal mucosa, lymphoid tissues, testes, renal system and urinary tract [16]. The soluble form of ACE2 is present in a small amount in the blood. This catalytically inactive soluble form of ACE2 is formed by the cleavage of membrane-bound ACE2 by the enzyme disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) [17].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 is a spherical, crown-shaped, enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus 66–100 nm in diameter with a genome size of ~29 kb [18]. For host tropism, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to cell-surface ACE2 proteins through their receptor-binding domain (RBD). Other than ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 has been found to interact with host proteases such as trypsin, factor X, TMPRSS2, furin, cathepsin L, and cathepsin B to facilitate its entry following priming by S protein [5, 19]. It was observed that SARS-CoV-2 RBD has a high binding affinity with the ACE2 than for SARS-CoV [20]. Upon entry into the host, the virus causes the downregulation of membrane-bound ACE2 [21, 22]. This downregulation of ACE2 expression is associated with the elevation of circulating Ang II levels and results in systemic RAS imbalance. Such RAS imbalance is associated with the development of multiple organ damage during SARS-CoV-2 infection [23].",
            "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an endocrine homeostatic regulator of vascular function that essentially regulates blood volume, blood pressure, urine volume, natriuresis, etc. The RAS is involved in cardiovascular homeostasis owing to its critical role in the regulation of water and electrolyte balance. RAS signaling mechanisms in the vasculature are involved in the maintenance of blood flow. Therefore, the RAS is an integral part of kidney functions. The inactive form of prorenin present in the juxtaglomerular (JG) cells of the kidney undergoes cleavage to produce renin in response to different conditions, such as a decrease in intratubular sodium levels and blood pressure (Fig. 2). The release of renin into the blood causes its reaction with angiotensinogen, a circulating protein. Angiotensinogen, which is produced in the liver and released in the blood, is acted upon by active renin. Free circulating active renin catalyzes the cleavage of angiotensinogen into angiotensin I (Ang I). Furthermore, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) facilitates the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II (Ang II). Ang II is a biologically active peptide that acts on two types of receptors: Ang II type 1 and type 2 receptors (AT1R and AT2R, respectively). The activation of AT1R by Ang II facilitates vasoconstriction, inflammation, salt and water reabsorption [24]. This effect of Ang II is reduced by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 catalyzes the conversion of Ang II into Ang-(1–7). The resultant heptapeptide binds to G-protein coupled receptors called Mas receptors (MasR). Furthermore, this ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/MasR axis prevents the accumulation of Ang II, a vasoconstrictor, and thus prevents the generation of hypertension [25]. In recent years, the discovery of RAS components in different tissues put forward the concept of local RAS [26]. The RAS components in several parts of the brain serve as a local RAS. All components of the brain RAS, including nACE2, have been identified in neuronal and non neuronal cells, such as the neurons, astrocytes, and microglia of the SFO, PVN, RVLM, AP, and NTS of the brain [27].Fig. 2Schematic representation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). JG cells of the kidney mediate the release of renin. Released renin acts on the liver, produces angiotensinogen, and catalyzes its cleavage into decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I). Ang I is converted into Ang II through the action of ACE. This Ang II binds to AT1 and AT2 receptors. Ang II binds to AT1 receptors in blood vessels and facilitates vasoconstriction, which increases blood pressure. Ang II also facilitates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal gland, which induces an increase in blood pressure through the retention of water in the kidney. Ang II-AT1R also mediates the secretion of ADH from the pituitary gland, which helps in the absorption of water in collecting ducts and thereby increases blood pressure. ACE2 breaks down Ang II to Ang-(1–7), causing a reduction in Ang II levels and a reduction in blood pressure.

            "Hypertension is one of the most common comorbidities and is distinctly observed within adult patients.

            "According to the available clinical data from COVID-19 patients, immune dysregulation is observed within patients with COVID-19. It is well known that uncontrolled blood pressure stimulates immune system dysregulation. Moreover, in humans, the deregulation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells plays a causal role in the development of hypertension [39]. In particular, immunosenescent CD8 + T cells are unable to perform antiviral defense effectively and hence lead to the overproduction of cytokines [40, 41]. This cytokine overproduction results in the development of hypertension-related complications such as organ damage [42, 43]. In COVID-19 patients, the elevation of immunomodulatory proteins such as IL2, IL6, IL10, MCP1, and TNF-α in plasma has been observed [44]. Few of these deregulated immunomodulatory proteins associated with the development of hypertension were identified in some experimental models [44]. In addition, immunomodulatory proteins and high levels of plasma troponin T (TnT) and D-dimers have been identified in most patients with severe COVID-19 [30, 33]. Taken together, epidemiological and clinical data from COVID-19 patients suggest that immune dysregulation results in the development of cytokine-storm-induced hypertension and directly correlates with progression to severe COVID-19 and mortality.",
            "As recent as two decades ago, the RAS was believed to function with renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin peptides, and their receptors. However, the discovery of ACE2 in 2000 changed the mechanistic understanding of the RAS [8]. Earlier, it was known that Ang II, a vasoactive peptide, is generated through the action of ACE and mediates blood pressure elevation by exerting its action through AT1 receptors. However, the discovery of ACE2 added a twist in the function of the RAS, as it negatively regulates the RAS through the generation of Ang-(1–7) from the degradation of Ang II. ACE2 was identified to balance the vaso-deleterious effect of ACE/Ang II/AT1R [6, 8]. The role of the classical RAS system was found to be associated with the regulation of blood pressure, fluid-electrolyte balance, and systemic vascular resistance. In addition to the classical systemic RAS, the local RAS in the brain also plays a pivotal role in the neural regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular function. Interestingly, the elements present in brain RAS processes are the same as those present in systemic RAS processes. It has also been noted that brain RAS overactivity, oxidative stress, and cyclooxygenase (COX) are involved in the generation of neurogenic hypertension (Fig. 1B).",
            "ACE2 expression is also ubiquitous in various organ systems, including the brain. Doobay et al. (2007) reported the presence of ACE2 proteins and mRNA in the brains of NSE-AT1A transgenic mice [13]. The isoform of ACE2 in the brain is also identified as neuronal ACE2 (nACE2), that is widely distributed within the brain. Hamming and colleagues observed ACE2 expression within endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the brain [45]. Recently, mouse and human brain transcriptomic analyses revealed a spatial and cell-type distribution of ACE2, calling it nACE2. Excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes also express nACE2 [46]. Of note, mouse dopaminergic neurons and cerebellar cells are nACE2 positives [46]. Notably, the distribution pattern of nACE2 is similar in both mouse and human brains. High nACE2 expression has been found in the substantia nigra and brain vesicles [46].",
            "To understand the role of nACE2 in the brain, different animal model systems have been used (Table 2). Several brain regions were found to be involved in the regulation of BP. Among a few, the prominent area wherein nACE2 was expressed was the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), thereby leading to further speculation on the role of the PVN in the neural control of blood pressure and body fluid homeostasis [13]. In the PVN, nACE2 was particularly detected within presynaptic and vasopressinergic neurons. Ang II infusion in the PVN resulted in the upregulation of AT1R and ACE levels with a subsequent reduction in ACE2 and MAS, leading to hypertension. Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β were also found to be increased in the PVN upon Ang II infusion (Fig. 1B). Sriramula et al. reported that nACE2 overexpression in the PVN of male Sprague–Dawley rats was capable of controlling neurogenic hypertension [47].Table 2List of model systems used to study the role of neuronal ACE2 in brain regionsModel SystemACE2 Overexpression/ reduction and tissue systemOutcomesReferenceSyn-hACE2 (SA) transgenic micehACE2 overexpression in neuronsOverexpression of ACE2 reduces DOCA salt-induced hypertension.

            "List of model systems used to study the role of neuronal ACE2 in brain regions",
            "Sympathoexcitation has been shown to be associated with the development of hypertension [48]. The RVLM, the vasomotor center, plays an important role in the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system by determining basal central sympathetic outflow. Several studies in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) showed that the overexpression of endothelial NOS (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS) in the RVLM facilitates sympathoinhibition by restoring the impaired baroreflex function [49, 50]. However, it was observed that oxidative stress in the RVLM was involved in the development of neurogenic hypertension in different hypertensive models, such as SHRSP, deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) salt-induced hypertensive models, dietary-induced models, and experimental jet lag models [51–54]. The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is considered to be a relay point because of its role in imparting Ang II signals from the brain to the peripheral nervous system [55]. Yamazato et al. (2007) showed that a spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model exhibited lower ACE2 expression and activity in the RVLM. Lentiviral-mediated ACE2 overexpression within the RVLM was shown to decrease BP in an SHR model [56]. In SHRs, the overexpression of ACE2 in glutamatergic neurons in the RVLM was associated with reduced BP. This suggests that ACE2 per se may not regulate blood pressure. The entire ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis contributes to the maintenance of blood pressure [57]. Moreover, nACE2 overexpression in the brain not only increases VEGF, FGF, IFN-γ, and IL6 gene expression but also upregulates eNOS/NO expression, which subsequently decreases the incidence of hypertension-mediated ischemic stroke [58].",
            "The use of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) salt is one of the most popular ways to induce hypertension in animal models. DOCA induces elevated Ang II levels in the brain without affecting Ang II systemic levels [59]. Increased expression of Nox-2, Nox-4, and nitrotyrosine and reduced expression of SOD and catalases have been observed in a DOCA model of hypertension, causing oxidative stress. Oxidative stress exacerbates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreases ACE2 activity through Ang II-mediated stimulation of AT1R. Xia et al. demonstrated that RAS overactivity in DOCA-salt-treated transgenic syn-hACE2 mice increases ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding, which creates neurogenic hypertension. ADAM17 knockdown and nACE2 overexpression in transgenic syn-hACE2 mice re-establish baroreflex and autonomic functions and reduce neurogenic hypertension and its associated inflammation [59, 60]. Furthermore, nACE2 overexpression in transgenic syn-hACE2 mice upregulates the AT2 receptor and MasR, thus facilitating a reduction in oxidative stress and COX expression, that attenuates the development of neurogenic hypertension [11]. Conditional overexpression of hACE2 in the brains of syn-hACE2 mice prevented neurogenic hypertension by increasing the AT2R/AT1R and Mas/AT1 receptor ratios [61]. DOCA treatment in synapsin-LoxP-hACE2 (SL) transgenic mice demonstrated brain regions involved in the generation of neurogenic hypertension, and it was observed that the overexpression of hACE2 in the SFO and PVN decreases BP [60].",
            "The first report of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF grabbed the attention of the scientific community and was a first step toward understanding the neuroinvasive potential and neurotropism mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. Initially, there were several viewpoints on the possible neuroinvasive route of SARS-CoV-2. However, due to the lack of evident research in this area, the answer to this question remains unknown. According to a few reports, SARS-CoV-2 might use a direct or indirect neuroinvasion pathway. The indirect pathway involves the release of the virus from the lungs into the bloodstream, leading to the presentation of viral antigens by antigen-presenting cells to the immune system. These immune cells may cross the blood-brain barrier and facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry within the CNS through the vagus nerve. A recent study by Rhea EM et al. identified that intranasal administration of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 into male CD-1 mice facilitated S1 subunit entry within the brain by crossing the BBB [62]. It was also observed that viral infection of endothelial cells in the CNS caused immune system deregulation, which may account for BBB disruption [63]. However, the direct pathway, that is, the transneuronal pathway, involves neuroinvasion through the olfactory nerves of the piriform cortex to the CNS. This pathway permits SARS-CoV-2 entry through primary sensory neuronal cells. After entry, these primary sensory neurons communicate with the neurons of the olfactory system, particularly mitral cells, and thus mediate the transport of the virus from the CSF toward the lymphatic system of the CNS and PNS. An autopsy analysis of COVID-19 patients identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in distinct regions of the brain, such as the medulla oblongata, cerebellum, and nasopharynx. In addition, the study suggested that this virus may enter the brain by crossing the neural-mucosal interface [64].",
            "An ultrastructural analysis of autopsy samples from COVID-19 patients confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in different areas of the CNS, such as the olfactory nerve, gyrus rectus, medulla oblongata, and trigeminal ganglions [65–67]. Moreover, a few autopsy studies of COVID-19 patients have shown a loss of neuronal cells and glial cells along with axonal degeneration in the nucleus tractus solitarii, vagus nerve, and dorsal raphe nuclei [65, 67]. Such autopsy analyses in COVID-19 patients confirm the involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS.",
            "To confirm the pathophysiology of COVID-19, Sun et al. developed a SARS-CoV-2 mouse model in both wild-type C57BL/6 mice and both young and aged hACE2 mice. They injected virus intranasally into transgenic SARS-CoV-2 hACE2 mice and reported the presence of viral S protein expression in neurons, microglial cells, and astrocytes [68]. However, several other studies using K18-hACE2 transgenic SARS-CoV-2 mice identified the presence of the virus in different parts of the brain, such as the thalamus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, medulla, area postrema, hypoglossal nucleus, and midbrain [69–72]. Altogether, both autopsy studies and experimental analyses support the neuroinvasion and neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Despite neuroinvasion and neurotropism mechanisms, several clinical studies and case report data from COVID-19 patients have revealed the occurrence of neurological manifestations. One such clinical study categorized neurological symptoms into three different categories to understand the neuroinvasive nature of SARS-CoV-2 in patients suffering from [1] CNS symptoms such as headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, epilepsy, and acute cerebrovascular disease; [2] PNS symptoms such as hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypoplasia, and neuralgia; and [3] skeletal muscular symptoms. They identified that ~36.4% of patients were found to manifest neurological symptoms. Among these patients, 25% had CNS symptoms, while the percentages of patients with PNS and skeletal muscle symptoms were 8.9% and 10.7%, respectively. Most of the patients with CNS symptoms had dizziness and headache, whereas hypogeusia was the most common PNS symptom [73]. In a cross-sectional study, the headache was observed to be the most common CNS symptom in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, in certain patients, the headache was found to be associated with intracranial hypertension [74]. The first case of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) in a patient with COVID-19 was reported in Brazil [75]. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is triggered by the overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system, which induces hypertension, causes renal injuries, etc. In a case report by Kishfy L et al. in 2020, it was observed that COVID-19 patients with blood pressure fluctuations develop manifestations of hypertensive encephalopathy such as PRES [76].",
            "Another clinical survey found that olfactory taste disorder (OTD) is a clinical symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is noteworthy that female patients are more susceptible to OTDs than male patients, providing a clue toward sexual differences in the etiology of COVID-19 [77]. Multiple organ failure is another prominent clinical reason for the severity of COVID-19 [78, 79]. In one such report, it was noted that recovered COVID-19 patients were more susceptible to depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, etc. [80]. In a recent case report, a patient with a SARS-CoV-2 infection also developed a rare type of acute transverse myelitis (ATM) [81].",
            "Most importantly, it is also evident that patients with severe CNS symptoms have low lymphocyte counts, which suggests the presence of immunosuppression. Additionally, the presence of high D-dimer levels is indicative of the development of cerebrovascular disease [73]. It is well known that a lower CD4:CD8 ratio is an indication of a progressive decrease in immunity [82]. However, in a study of COVID-19 patients, the CD4:CD8 ratio was unaltered, but CD8 overexpression was observed, and the number of CD8 + cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) was significantly increased [83]. Cytokine storms are also observed in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Such cytokine storms are associated with an impairment of the nicotinic cholinergic neuronal system [84]. CT and MRI studies of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections suggest the occurrence of a rare complication of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) [85]. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 3D T1W1 MRI analyses of recovered COVID-19 patients showed an enlargement of the hippocampus, olfactory cortex, Heschl’s gyrus, and rolandic operculum; a reduction in the mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD); and an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) in white matter [86]. All these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a disruption in the microstructural and functional integrity of the brain [86]. In a recent clinical study, it was observed that some COVID-19 patients without a prior history of hypertension develop hypertension after postinfection. Critical analysis of these data identified elevated levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnl), prolactin, and Ang II in COVID-19 patients [87]. In yet another study, hypertension was identified as the second most prevalent consequence of COVID-19 [88]. Both CNS and PNS symptoms continue to persist even after the infection is cured [89].",
            "Overall, from the critical analysis of published data on COVID-19 patients, one may conclude that neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV-2 causes neuronal degeneration and subsequently activates astrocytes and microglial cells, which generate dysfunction within the cardiovascular center in the brain. Such dysfunction induces RAS imbalance, which in turn results in immune dysregulation. These abnormalities within the CNS after SARS-CoV-2 infection are linked to cellular immune deficiency, which leads to the development of hypertension, cerebrovascular diseases, and coagulopathies.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 infection in host cells results in RAS overactivation due to the loss of ACE2 either by ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding or by increased viral load. Increased Ang II levels lead to increased AT1R activation, which indicates decreases in the ACE2/ACE ratio, AT2R/AT1R ratio, and MasR/AT1R ratio. Such imbalances result in heightened inflammatory responses, such as cytokine storms, leading to post-COVID-19 complications and mortality (Fig. 3A and B). A new line of diagnostics needs to be developed to monitor the inflammatory response and coagulopathy, even in recovering patients, to reduce post-COVID-19 deaths due to cardiac arrest, neuronal hemorrhage, and multiorgan failure. Some of the existing strategies to combat comorbid SARS-CoV-2 infection and hypertension are discussed below.Fig. 3Effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the brain RAS pathway. A In healthy individuals, the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) system is well balanced, as blood pressure is well maintained. B However, SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients results in the generation of neurogenic hypertension through the downregulation of the neuronal ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR vasoprotective axis. This downregulation of the vasoprotective axis results in decreases in the ACE2/ACE ratio, AT2R/AT1R ratio, and MasR/AT1R ratio. Vasoprotective axis downregulation also increases cytokine production and neuroinflammation and activates microglial cells. The red arrow indicates the downregulation of enzyme or peptide activity.

            "SARS-CoV-2 utilizes ACE2 for entry into host cells. Since the use of rhACE2 treatment may sufficiently prevent the priming of endogenous ACE2 by the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, it may exert beneficial effects by restoring the regulation of the RAS. However, the limitation of this treatment lies in the high molecular size (89.6 kDa) of rhACE2, that may exert lower activity against the tissue RAS. Currently, the developed rhACE2 is in phase II clinical trials [90, 91].",
            "ACE-is and ARBs are routinely used for the treatment of hypertension, CVD, and heart failure. The use of an ACE-i exerts a protective effect against high blood pressure by inhibiting the production of Ang II. Several ACE-is, such as lisinopril, captopril, benazepril, fosinopril, and enalapril, are used to treat hypertension. The routine use of an ACE-i causes several adverse side effects, such as dry cough, dizziness, and hyperkalemia. Therefore, ARBs are preferred over ACE-is because they provide excellent efficacy, fewer adverse events, and no negative metabolic effects in patients with hypertension, CVD, and heart failure [90]. From several animal studies, it was evident that peripherally administered ARBs were able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and block AT1 receptors within the brain, thereby exerting positive effects by lowering blood pressure [54, 92–96]. Although all ARBs are lipophilic to some extent, the variation in their degree of lipophilicity and pharmacokinetic properties, such as plasma half-life, oral bioavailability, and the volume of distribution (Vd), leads to different effects on hypertension. In addition, experimental evidence has shown that ARB liposolubility leads to better absorption and tissue penetration and facilitates sympathoinhibition by strong binding to AT1 receptors [48, 97].",
            "During the early onset of COVID-19, it was hypothesized that ACE inhibitor (ACE-i)/AT1R blocker (ARB) administration may result in the upregulation of ACE2 levels, which decreases Ang II levels and culminates in AT1R response deactivation. This phenomenon might be associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease-linked complications. However, several clinical studies, meta-analyses, single-site cohort studies, and systematic review studies of COVID-19 patients from different countries later reported that the use of ARBs and ACE-is does not have any correlation with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, the use of ARBs and ACE-is provides beneficial effects, such as a reduction in hospitalization stay and an improved survival rate [98–106]. Several societies are working toward the cause of hypertension, such as the International Society of Hypertension, European Society of Hypertension, European Society of Cardiology, Japanese Society of Hypertension, Japanese Circulation Society, and American Heart Association, which support the continuation of ARB/ACE-i treatment in patients with hypertension and those who develop hypertension during infection [107–111]. Currently, several clinical trials on ARBs and ACE inhibitors suggest ARBs as an alternative treatment option for SARS-CoV-2 infection [112–127]. Several such ARBs are still under investigation (Table 3).Table 3Characteristics of ongoing clinical trials for studying the safety and efficacy of ARBs and ACEI in patients with COVID-19DrugDesignStatusGroupTotal numberPrimary outcomeCountry of registrationACEI/ARBInterventionalEnrolling by invitationACEI /ARB152Clinical status -Severity of disease, admission to ICU, DeathUSANCT04338009ACEI/ARBObservationalNot yet recruitingACEI/ARB6000000Clinical status-identification of disease severityFrance NCT04356417ACEI/ARBInterventionalRecruitingACEI/ARB208Clinical status- Severity of disease, admission to ICU, DeathAustria NCT04353596ACEI/ARBObservationalcompletedACEI/ARB314Clinical status-Severity of disease, admission to ICU, DeathSaudi Arabia NCT04357535ARB, ACEi, DRiObservationalRecruitingARB, ACEi, DRi10Clinical status-Severity of disease and BPUkraine NCT04364984ACEI/ARBObservationalCompletedACEI/ARB And Non-ACEI/ARB10000Clinical status-Hospitalization and mortalityUSA NCT04467931ACEI/ARBInterventionalRecruitingACEI/ARB215Clinical status-Admission to hospital and deathDenmark NCT04351581ACEI/ARBObservationalRecruitingACEI/ARB2574Hospital output-Clinical statusSpain NCT04367883ACEI/ARBInterventionalRecruitingACEI/ARB700Clinical status- admission to ICU and deathBrazil NCT04364893ACEI/ARB and Non-ARB/ACEIInterventionalSuspendedACEI/ARB and Non-ARB/ACEI2414Clinical status- Severity of disease, admission to ICUIreland NCT04330300ACEI/ARBObservationalRecruitingACEI/ARB500Clinical status- Severity of disease, admission to ICU, DeathCanada NCT04510623ACEI/ARBObservationalCompletedACEI/ARB275Rate of deathChina NCT04318301ACEI/ARBObservationalNot yet RecruitingACEI/ARB5000Disease severity or deathItaly NCT04318418ACEI/ARBInterventionalRecruitingACEI/ARB554Clinical status- clinical improvement of PatientsFrance NCT04329195ACEI/ARBObservationalRecruitingACEI/ARB2000Clinical status of patientsItaly NCT04331574ACEI/ARBInterventionalRecruitingACEI/ARB240Disease severity, ICU, and Clinical statusBrazil NCT04493359",

            "From recently available knowledge, it is evident that the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a decrease in ACE2. The resultant increased level of Ang II destabilizes the renin-angiotensin system, causing a decrease in the ACE2/ACE ratio, AT2R/AT1R ratio, and MasR/AT1R ratio, which aggravates the development of cytokine-storm-induced hypertension. The use of ACE-is/ARBs in COVID-19 patients proved to be beneficial and lifesaving. ARBs block the AT1R-Ang II interaction and thereby increase ACE2. However, ACE-is facilitate elevation in ACE2 by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The increase in ACE2 elevates the ACE2/ACE ratio, AT2R/AT1R ratio, and MasR/AT1R ratio and restores the RAS. Overall, ARB/ACE-i treatment in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections proved to be lifesaving, as it balanced the RAS and lowered the chances of immune dysregulation, which accounted for lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 infiltration in the brain has been shown by many clinical studies and supported by autopsy studies. Changes in brain structure have also been shown through CT and MRI. However, further research is warranted to link the process of virus invasion in the brain with CNS symptoms, such as the development of neurogenic hypertension. Based on collective critical evaluation of various scientific letters, viewpoints, discussions, and experimental data, we speculate that, unlike SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 invades the CNS through the blood-brain barrier and through the olfactory nerves of the piriform cortex. In the CNS, the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 increases ADAM17, which mediates the shedding of nACE2, culminating in the loss of nACE2; this further causes persistent RAS activation through an increase in the AngII-AT1 axis and generates neurogenic hypertension. As hypertension is convincingly accepted as the most prevalent comorbidity in deceased COVID-19 patients, the development of alternative strategies to maintain the physiological conditions of the RAS to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection cannot be undermined. These alternative strategies should be aimed at preventing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells and controlling ACE2 shedding and Ang II levels at an early phase of infection. The potential effects of AT1 receptor blockers or soluble ACE2 treatments may be considered for the management of COVID-19.",

            "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include dry cough, difficult breathing, fever, fatigue, and may lead to pneumonia and respiratory failure. There are significant gaps in the current understanding of whether SARS-CoV-2 attacks the CNS directly or through activation of the peripheral immune system and immune cell infiltration. Although the modality of neurological impairments associated with COVID-19 has not been thoroughly investigated, the latest studies have observed that SARS-CoV-2 induces neuroinflammation and may have severe long-term consequences. Here we review the literature on possible cellular and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced-neuroinflammation. Activation of the innate immune system is associated with increased cytokine levels, chemokines, and free radicals in the SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenic response at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB disruption allows immune/inflammatory cell infiltration into the CNS activating immune resident cells (such as microglia and astrocytes). This review highlights the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in COVID-19-induced neuroinflammation, which may lead to neuronal death. A better understanding of these mechanisms will help gain substantial knowledge about the potential role of SARS-CoV-2 in neurological changes and plan possible therapeutic intervention strategies.",
            "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first incidence of this infection was reported in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. A few months later, the SARS-CoV-2 quickly spread and became a severe issue to public health worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a 29.8–30 kb enveloped-single strand RNA virus, which belongs to the Coronaviridae family (Betacoronavirus genus, Sarbecovirus subgenus) (1). Although the studies about its genomic structural features are limited, current reports show that SARS-CoV-2 has many functional domains, such as N-terminal and receptor-binding domains and receptor-binding motif (RBM). Emerging evidence revealed that RBM mediates SARS-CoV-2 binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (2–4). In terms of structure and pathogenicity, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of four structural proteins and eight accessory proteins. The structural proteins include a spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins. The accessory proteins include 3a, 3b, p6, 7a, 7b, 8b, 9b, and open reading frame 14 (ORF14) located at the 3‘-end. The genomic structure similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is particularly evident at the amino-acid level. However, there are some reported differences between the two viruses concerning the accessory proteins. Unlike SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 doesn't express 8a, and the 8b protein is relatively longer (121 aa) than the SARS-CoV virus (84 aa). In addition, 3b protein is much shorter in SARS-CoV-2 (22 aa) compared to that expressed in the SARS-CoV virus (154 aa) (5). The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is slightly different from that expressed in SARS-CoV one. The furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 may increase the spreading efficiency of the virus relative to other coronaviruses. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the viral S protein to bind to the ACE2 receptor. SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) differs in two regions that bind with ACE2 (6). The SARS-CoV-2 RBD gives the SARS-CoV-2 more interactions with ACE2 comparing with the SARS-CoV virus. The affinity of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 for the ACE2 is about four-folds higher than that of the RBD of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, the dissociation constant (Kd) between the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is much lower than that observed with the RBD of SARS-CoV (7, 8). Combined together, these minor differences may play a significant role in the overall activity and severity of the infection of these viruses.",
            "Interestingly, recent studies found that ACE2 plays a pivotal role in the SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells via endocytosis (9–11). The SARS-CoV-2 causes flu-like symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to severe respiratory failure (12). These symptoms include dry cough, difficult breathing, fever, fatigue, and may reach pneumonia and respiratory failure (13). It has been reported that the morbidity and mortality of this disease are higher in older individuals. Furthermore, patients with comorbidities, including hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, and cancer, are considered at high risk of death due to COVID-19 infection (14, 15). In addition to the lungs, SARS-CoV-2 affects other organs, such as the heart, liver, kidney, and brain (16–19). Because ACE2 plays an important role in cardiac functions, including vasodilation and anti-hypertrophic effect, SARS-CoV-2–induced ACE2 downregulation may cause myocardial dysfunction (20, 21). A histological study has shown that SARS-CoV-2 could result in endotheliitis and inflammatory cell accumulation in these organs (22, 23). Post-mortem analysis demonstrated that there was inflammatory cells accumulation and apoptotic bodies in the kidney, heart, and intestinal tissues of COVID-19 patients. In addition, mononuclear cells accumulated in the lung tissue of these patients. The COVID-19-induced endotheliitis could result in impaired microcirculatory function in COVID-19 patients. Microvascular impairment could cause vasoconstriction, which subsequently leads to inflammation, edema, and ischemic conditions (23, 24). Encephalitis is characterized by brain inflammation associated with neurologic dysfunction (25). SARS-CoV-2 induces encephalitis by activating the immune cell system and producing inflammatory mediators (26).",
            "Moreover, encephalopathy and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities, including increased inflammatory markers, were observed in COVID-19 patients suggesting that elevation of CSF cytokines and chemokines following SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to neuroinflammation (27, 28). The fact that SARS-CoV-2 induced-neuroinflammation and neurological alternations have been recently reported, but whether neuroinflammation-induced neurological alternations after SARS-CoV-2 infection are related to CNS immune activation or direct neuroinvasion is still unclear (Figure 1) (19, 29). This review summarizes the recent findings that may help understand the link between COVID-19 and neuroinflammation-induced neurological alterations. Understanding the signaling pathways activated within the CNS upon COVID-19 could help prevent the onset and/or exacerbation of neurological disorders. Many central regulators modulate the neuroinflammatory processes and responses, and when this tightly controlled system is dysregulated, it can lead to the onset of uncontrolled neuroinflammation (30). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are among these critical neuroinflammatory modulators (31). MiRNAs are a large family of short-non-coding RNAs involved in regulating several protein-coding genes. MiRNA has been identified as a biomarker and serves cellular processes like differentiation, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and embryonic development. However, miRNAs can bind to mRNAs, interact with a single or several target genes, and play a critical role in a growing list of pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders. Although the detailed mechanisms underlying the miRNAs' role, some studies have demonstrated that miRNAs, as a form of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), binds target mRNA at the 3‘-UTR motif and results in the repression of the translation process or may further cause mRNA degradation (32–34). Although the role of many miRNAs in neuroinflammation has not been thoroughly studied, alteration of certain miRNAs in immune cells could modulate inflammation via many mechanistic aspects, including targeting signaling pathways in inflammation (35). For example, miRNAs such as miR-21 and 29a can interact with toll-like receptors and subsequently activate microglia, macrophages, and neurons (35, 36). MiR-155 promotes inflammatory processes and negatively regulates BBB function by modulating endothelial cell-to-cell interactions and the interendothelial tight junctions (TJs), such as claudins (37).",
            "Schematic illustration showing the main impact of SARS-CoV-2 on neuroinflammation-induced neuronal death. The figure illustrates the currently proposed mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 produces neuroinflammation-induced neuronal death by promoting peripheral immune and inflammatory responses, impacting the CNS through immune/inflammatory cell infiltration across the BBB.",
            "Neuroinflammation is induced when the neurovascular unit (NVU), including neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, responds to stimuli (38). It has been reported that neuroinflammation is predominately mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and free radicals (30, 39). Controlled neuroinflammatory responses are essential in intrinsic immune-to-brain communication, injury-induced remodeling, and immune preconditioning or neuroinflammation. However, chronic or uncontrolled neuroinflammation induces immune cells' recruitment, oxidative stress, and tissue damage. Increased cytokines, chemokines, Nitric oxide, and free radical production is mediated by activated resident cells in the central nervous system (CNS), including microglia and astrocytes. In addition to the activation of CNS resident glial cells, the infiltration of peripheral immune cells and increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability significantly contribute to the neuroinflammation process (39, 40). Several reactive components contribute to neuroinflammation. These include the following:",
            "The BBB is highly susceptible to peripheral inflammation, activating inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines (41). Cytokines are intercellular signaling proteins playing critical roles in cellular communication and activation. Also, it has been shown that cytokines are involved in many physiological and pathological events, including the immune response (42). For example, IL-6 plays an essential role in B lymphocytes' differentiation into mature plasma cells that secrete immunoglobulins. Also, IL-6 mediates the activation, growth, and differentiation of T-cells (43).",
            "Chemokines are protein mediators that bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), mediating various pathophysiological processes. These include cell migration, inflammation, and disease progression. Chemokines are classified into multiple families based on the conserved cysteine residues, such as CCL, CXCL, and CX3CL. Chemokines have many sub-family receptors, including CXCRs, CCR, CX3CR, and XCR, and many chemokines are ligands for more than one type of receptor (44–46). It has also been reported that systemic cytokines and chemokines can promote a BBB breach, thus facilitating the infiltration/extravasation of immune and inflammatory cells into the CNS (47).",
            "Peripheral inflammation or infection induces the release of cytokines, chemokines, and other factors that alter BBB permeability and facilitate the infiltration of immune/inflammatory cells into the CNS (47). One of the potential mechanisms underlying the peripheral immune/inflammation-mediated BBB breakdown is that systemic-released cytokines and chemokines by immune or inflammatory cells can impair the neurovascular endothelial function and disrupt the TJs (48). Emerging pieces of evidence have shown that direct immune-mediated pathogens, such as viruses, can infect the CNS in several ways, such as by infecting circulating cells in the bloodstream, which can then traverse the BBB and reach the CNS with their viral load (49, 50). Degradation of TJ proteins can further facilitate more immune and inflammatory cells infiltration into the CNS, leading to the activation of resident immune cells within the CNS, such as the microglia. A study showed that experimental induction of peripheral inflammation significantly increased the number of activated microglia cells in the brain (47, 51).",
            "CSF samples are still considered the gold standard to search for and characterize biomarkers of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (52). It has also been reported that inflammatory changes of CSF biomarkers, including pleocytosis, have been detected upon infectious diseases, particularly enterovirus-induced meningitis and encephalitis (53). Experimental evidence revealed that meningoencephalitis viral infections impact the CSF biomarker makeup differently. For example, enterovirus and lentivirus infection increased CSF IL-12 and IFN-γ levels (54) while herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) caused the expression of CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL10 and HSV2 that of CXCL11 and CCL8 (55). In addition, CXCL8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, and IFN-γ levels were increased in the CSF of patients affected by mumps meningitis (56). In addition to cytokines and chemokines, neurofilaments (Nf, which are highly specific scaffolding neuronal proteins) were increased in the CSF of patients with encephalitis (57). Taken together, these studies suggest that CSF biomarker analysis should be evaluated and taken into consideration to determine and characterize the impact of infection-induced neuroinflammation. Our review will also discuss inflammatory changes of CSF in COVID-19 disease.",
            "Although their mechanistic role in neuroinflammation has not been fully understood, glial cells, such as microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, mediate initiation and amplification of the CNS inflammation (39). The alteration in BBB permeability leads to the recruitment of immune cells into the CNS, promoting microglial activation. Activated microglial cells induce the production of cytokines and chemokines, resulting in the activation of astrocytes. Subsequently, activated astrocytes release more cytokines and chemokines that exacerbate neuroinflammation (58). Experimental studies using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to activate microglia showed that microglial TNF-α and NO induce astrocytic TNF-α and NO production (59, 60). Growing evidence showed that reactivated astrocytes could also promote inflammatory mediators-induced microglial activation and migration (61). Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS, play a critical role in maintaining axons' integrity, supporting axonal metabolism, and contributing to neuronal survival (62, 63). It has been demonstrated that neuroinflammation damages oligodendrocytes. Although microglia-oligodendrocyte cross-talk has not been fully understood, experimental activation of microglia with LPS induced oligodendrocyte death. Upon viral infections, demyelinating lesions were created in response to microglial activation (64). Taken together, these summarized findings support the contribution of microglia-astrocyte cross-talk in neuroinflammation.",
            "Neurons are considered the fundamental unit of the CNS function. The interaction between glial cells and neurons plays an essential role in brain plasticity's pathophysiology (65, 66). Activated microglia promotes neurotoxicity via releasing cytotoxic molecules, such as cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Activation of the peripheral inflammatory system induces pro-inflammatory cytokines, which subsequently disrupt the BBB. For instance, IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and IL-17 increase BBB permeability. Due to inflammation-induced BBB disruption, cytokines enter the CNS and activate glial cells. In addition, IL-17 can induce neurovascular endothelial CCL2 and CXCL1, which promote the trans-endothelial migration of immune cells into the CNS (67, 68). Chemical activation of microglia with acrylamide results in increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-18. The increase of these cytokines was associated with acrylamide neurotoxicity in both in vivo and in vitro experimental models (69). A recent study has shown that pharmacological inhibition of microglial activation significantly reduced neuronal death (70). Neuroinflammation-induced neuron injury can also release cytotoxic and chemotactic mediators, which subsequently can activate surrounding microglial cells and exacerbate the microglia-mediated neuroinflammation (71, 72). Excessive neuroinflammation-induced cytotoxins release leads to neuronal glutamate dysregulation and caspase-dependent apoptosis. This cytotoxins release induces neuronal death and neurodegeneration, accounting for the cross-talk between neurons and glial cells in the neuroinflammation phenomenon (73, 74). Neuroinflammation-induced TNF-α promotes the release of glutamate from microglia, resulting in increased extracellular levels of this neurotransmitter. Increased glutaminase expression, the key enzyme that converts glutamine to glutamate, is considered one of the potential mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation induced by glutamate. In addition, glutamate synthesis is stimulated by microglial activation (75). A hippocampal slice analysis showed that IL-1β stimulates glutamate release by activating Ca2+ releasing signaling pathways (76).",
            "The CNS is part of a growing list of biological systems whose physiological function might be altered by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neuropathological changes have been demonstrated in the CNS upon COVID-19. These changes include the induction of unwarranted inflammatory responses resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory mediators (77). Recent clinical reports have shown that inflammation was induced in COVID-19 cases, and this induction was associated with an increased level of cytokines, including interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (78). Previous studies have revealed that inflammation alters BBB integrity through cytokines-induced TJ proteins degradation. Emerging evidence demonstrated that TJ degradation, particularly claudin-5 and ZO-1, increases BBB permeability (79, 80). Alteration of the BBB integrity increases the opportunity for the viruses and cytokines to pass the BBB and enter the CNS, which activates cerebral immune cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, resulting in cytokines-induced neuroinflammation (81, 82). A postmortem case study has shown that 37 of 43 COVID-19 patients had astrogliosis, 34 patients had microglial activation in the brainstem and cerebellum, and six patients had ischemic lesions (83). The significant role of microglia and astrocytes in neuroinflammation has been characterized (38). It has been found that systemic infection can induce microglial activation in the CNS (84), and microglial cells are more sensitive to pathogens than astrocytes. Upon activation of microglia, molecular signals including IL-1 and TNF activate astrocytes. Activated astrocytes can produce many inflammatory factors, including TNF-α, ROS, and nitric oxide (NO), in response to microglial activation. This mutual communication between microglia and astrocytes amplifies the cascaded neuroinflammation (38) (Figure 2). A clinical study done on 43 patients showed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus caused microglial activation and infiltration in the brainstem and cerebellum in 79% of the patients with COVID-19 (39). ACE2 receptors are expressed in several brain regions, including the substantia nigra, brain ventricles, and cortex (85). The viral S protein has been reported to interact with the ACE2 receptors expressed on the brain's endothelial lining (86) and acts as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Notably, SARS-CoV reduces ACE2 expression, indicating the crucial role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infection (87, 88). An experimental approach showed that ACE2-knockout mice experienced less aggressive SARS-CoV infection than wild-type mice (89). A very recent study also showed that dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid, blocks the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus entrance into ACE2 high expressing HEK293T cells (90). Single-cell gene expression analysis demonstrated the RNA expression of ACE2 and cathepsin L (CTSL) in oligodendrocytes and microglia, respectively.",
            "Reactive cellular components-mediated neuroinflammation. 1. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the immune system, further enhancing circulating immune/inflammatory cell infiltration through the BBB. 2. Monocytes and associated pro-inflammatory mediators activate innate immune cells within the CNS, such as microglia and astrocytes. 3. Activated microglial cells induce release cytokines, which further activate astrocytes. 4. Activated astrocytes release mediators, such as TNF, prostaglandins, and glutamate, mediating neuroinflammation-induced neurotoxicity.",
            "Furthermore, astrocytes within the cerebral cortex of those patients expressed a high level of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) (83). In general, ACE2 promotes neuroinflammation and oxidative stress via activation of the AT1 receptor (91). It also has been shown that the increased level of CTSL was associated with the high expression of inflammatory mediators and NF-kB (92). Interestingly, several studies have revealed that TMPRSS2 facilitates virus entry into host cells (85). Taken together, the above-summarized studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the CNS cellular components involved in neuroinflammation.",
            "Although few clinical reports link SARS-CoV-2-related encephalitis and encephalopathy, growing evidence shows that these conditions could represent manifestations of the COVID-19 disease. In May 2020, a clinical report confirmed the presence of encephalitis biomarkers in the CSF of a SARS-CoV-2 patient in Japan (93). At the same time, a COVID-19 case with brainstem inflammation was as rhombencephalitis in the UK (94), and a COVID-19 encephalitis case was also reported in the US (95). Moreover, a recent report showed that 16 of 214, and 40 of 58 hospitalized patients in China and France, respectively, were diagnosed with encephalopathy (96). An analysis of CSF of COVID-19 encephalitis cases showed increased levels of IL-6, TNF- α, and β2-microglobulin.",
            "Interestingly, Nf light chain, GFAP, and TREM2 were also increased in these COVID-19 encephalitis cases, thus suggesting the concurrent onset of neuronal injury and glial activation (97). Although encephalitis is not considered a common post-SARS-CoV-2 complication, severe COVID-19 cases are at high risk of developing these types of comorbidities (98). Since a limited number of studies are currently investigating the connection between COVID-19 and neurological complications, more research and effort should be put into unraveling and characterize the possible linking mechanisms and pathological implications.",
            "Several studies have demonstrated that circulating cytokines can cross the BBB and enter the CNS. Cytokines also can be released from neurons and glial cells in the brain. Increased cytokines levels in the brain for a pronged period promote neurotoxic pathogenesis and neurodegenerative disorders (99). There are many well-known cytokines members, including ILs, IFN, and TNF. A recent study showed that the mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-α were significantly high in patients with COVID-19 (100).",
            "Furthermore, a cytokine analysis study of 131 plasma specimens demonstrated that plasma concentrations of several cytokines, including IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, were significantly increased in severe cases of COVID-19 compared to control groups (101). These cytokines can induce inflammatory and immune responses resulting in further cytotoxicity (85, 102, 103). It has been reported that cytokine storm in COVID-19 mediates rapid proliferation and activation of T-cells and macrophages (104).",
            "Recent studies reported robust induction of chemokines, including CCL2, CCL8, and CCL11, due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, serum levels of chemokines, CXCL2, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL16, increased in COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, this elevation of chemokine levels was associated with monocyte and neutrophils induction during COVID-19 disease (105–107). It has been reported that CXCL10 and CCL2 positive macrophages were high in severe cases of COVID-19 (108). An in vitro study has been shown that CX3CL1, known as fractalkine (FKN), was upregulated by infection with SARS-CoV-2 (107). Most importantly, a recently proposed mechanism suggests that decreased ACE2 and increased CX3CL1 induce vascular damage due to activation of cytotoxic immune cells and inflammatory activity, which contribute to platelet activation and thrombosis. Patients with severe COVID-19 had approximately a two-fold increase in CX3CL1 levels compared to control individuals or patients with mild symptoms (109). Emerging evidence revealed that ACE2 depletion results in CX3CL1 upregulation (110). Chemokines activation as a response to neuroinflammation can trigger signaling pathways, including oxidative stress, which subsequently cause neuronal death (111).",
            "Free radicals are highly active chemical molecules that bind to macromolecules, such as DNA, proteins, and lipids, resulting in DNA damage, protein degradation, and lipid peroxidation. The typical free radicals include superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite (112). Although the nature of free radical induction in COVID-19 disease has not been well-studied, inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, play a critical role in stimulating free radicals. As mentioned previously in this review, levels of cytokines increased in COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, cytokines-induced immune system activation has been considered one of the predominant pathways to activate free radical generation (113). Oxidative stress results from an imbalance between free radical production and the counteractivity of the antioxidant response system. Excessive ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) induce protein damage and mitochondrial dysfunction (114). Numerous studies have shown that viral infections cause oxidative stress resulting in inflammation and endothelial injury (115–117). It has been reported that inflammation and endothelial damage appeared after COVID-19 (23, 115). Recent studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection activates neutrophils, which migrate rapidly to the targeted tissues or back into the bloodstream. Neutrophil infiltration into the CNS through the BBB has been previously identified (118). Activated neutrophils contribute to worsening redox imbalance and inflict tissue damage by generating an excess of ROS (119, 120).",
            "Literature suggests that viruses also use host machinery to produce miRNAs. MiRNAs have a length of 18–25 nucleotides and are small non-coding RNA that post-transcriptionally regulates the target mRNA (121). Gene expression and regulation at the translational level are controlled by mRNA-inhibiting RNAs (122). Many viral diseases like Herpes Simplex Viruses (HSV), Influenza, Dengue, and Hepatitis C (HCV) encode and express functional viral microRNAs targeting both viral and cellular transcripts and interfere with the host cell's miRNA machinery. These viruses can block or impair miRNA pathways, evade cellular miRNAs targeting viral mRNAs, make use of cellular miRNAs to their favor as well as synthesize their miRNA to generate a more favorable cellular environment (123–126). Recently, many studies are focusing on identifying miRNAs as a target of various viral diseases, as Antagomirs designed for HCV infection are showing promising results in human phase II trials (127). Likewise, miRNAs targeting can be investigated as one of the therapeutic approaches for COVID-19 and MERS viruses. It has been previously reported that SARS-CoV spike genes can be reduced through human miRNA-based therapeutics (128). NF-κB, a canonical pro-inflammatory transcription factor, increases the expression of both anti-inflammatory (miR-124, miR-146a) and pro-inflammatory (miR-155) miRNAs. Another miRNA, miR-155, is required for B cells' adequate functioning and production of cytokines, macrophages, and T cells response (129).",
            "Similarly, miR-27b acts as an anti-inflammatory transcriptional activator in human macrophages and causes a decrease in inflammatory cytokines production, including IL-6 and TNF-α (130). MiR-326 is another pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a role in the production of IL-17 (131). Additionally, miR-124 is majorly expressed in the nervous system and has an anti-inflammatory effect mediated by a cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in macrophages (132). The screening of 50 miRNAs in COVID-19 samples in a recently published report has shown significant changes in the expression level on these miRNAs compared to controls. Twenty miRNAs were upregulated, including miR-31-5p, miR-3125, and miR-4742-3p. By contrast, 30 miRNAs were down-regulated including miR-1275, miR-3617-5p, and miR-500b-3p (133). The importance of the discovery stands on the fact that miRNA are crucial cellular regulators that affect various genes' expression and, consequently, modulate multiple physiological and pathological processes. Khan et al. have highlighted the contribution of miRNA in pathological events during SARS-COV-2, thus underlining the benefits of developing RNA-based therapeutics to mitigate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (134). However, more studies are needed to properly correlate the expression changes of miRNAs with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "The CNS, including the brain and the spinal cord, responds to viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. These infections caused by these organisms activated the immune system generating neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, and neurodegeneration (135). SARS-CoV-2 has an impact on the CNS, including neuronal damage and astrocytic dysfunction. Interestingly, Kanberg et al. measured two plasma biomarkers of CNS injury in 47 COVID-19 patients divided into three categories, including mild, moderate, and severe conditions. These markers are the neurofilament light (NfL) chain protein, a marker of intra-axonal neuronal injury, and the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytic activation and injury. Their data show that these two biomarkers are significantly elevated in the plasma of severe COVID-19 patients, suggesting the onset of neuronal damage directly related to the severity of COVID-19 in those patients (136). It has been previously reported that GFAP is a useful biomarker of acute inflammation in patients with multiple sclerosis (137).",
            "Furthermore, a retrospective study conducted in Wuhan, China, showed that 36.4% of COVID-19 patients presented neurologic manifestations (138), including headaches, vomiting, ischemic stroke, BBB disruption, and damage of the NVU. The additional pieces of evidence reinforced the notion of a link between COVID-19 and the onset of neurological impairments (139–144). The story of SARS-CoV-2 mediating neuronal damage has been reported in the three stages of the body's viral lifespan, including entry, maturation, and release.",
            "The first stage is the virus's entry has been linked to the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). One of the hypotheses outlining the role of SARS-CoV-2 in neurotoxicity is that neuronal damage is specifically dependent on the availability of the ACE2 receptor. ACE2 is widely expressed in many tissues, such as the lungs, heart, and brain. It has been confirmed that ACE2 plays a crucial anti-inflammatory role by mediating the conversion of angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) (145). Ang 1-7 acts as a vasodilator, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory agent (146). Recent emerging evidence revealed that ACE2 is also a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and as a “ligand-receptor” complex enters the host cells (147, 148). The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to membrane-bound ACE2 leads to reduce ACE2 expression (149). A previous in vivo study showed that deficiency of ACE2 negatively impacted viral replication and reduced the severity of pathological conditions upon acute respiratory distress syndrome (146). During the second stage of infection, the viral mRNA is copied and used for the biosynthesis and maturation of viral proteins. The third stage culminates with the release of the viral genetic materials, which is then recognized by pathogen-associated molecular patterns resulting in the activation of pro-inflammatory molecules. These pro-inflammatory mediators then initiate the innate immune response (150).",
            "Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 induced shedding of ACE2 can impair the metabolism of desArg9-bradykinin (desArg9-BK, a potent ligand of the bradykinin receptor B1 (B1R). B1R is G protein-coupled receptor induced by inflammatory cytokines, and it is resistant to desensitization. Activation of the B1R receptor promotes inflammation and increases the permeability of the BBB (151). Des-Arg-BK derives from the hydrolysis of bradykinin (BK) by ACE and promotes inflammation, vascular permeability, and cytokine generation by interacting with B1R (152). It has been reported that B1R expression is increased in the setting of inflammation and tissue injury (152, 153). Under normal circumstances, desArg9-BK is broke down by ACE2 into inactive peptides (154); however, in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus can further promote inflammation and loss of vascular integrity by lowering ACE2, thus leading to an increase of desArg9-BK available to activate the B1 receptor and promote cerebrovascular damage.",
            "Interestingly, CNS invasion occurs in SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV and can cause neuronal deaths (155). SARS-CoV has been detected in the cytoplasm of neurons in the hypothalamus and cortex of the brain of SARS autopsies. In addition, six of eight cases of SARS were diagnosed with edema and red degeneration of neurons in the brains (156). SARS-CoV had been detected in CSF upon an acute phase of infection (157). A clinical study showed that the brain of a patient, who was suffering from neurological symptoms after SARS-CoV infection, had neuronal necrosis and edema. The same study confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV in the brain (158). Likewise, an in vivo study showed CNS infection, particularly neurons, in human ACE2 transgenic mice intranasally infected with SARS-CoV. Since SARS-CoV was detected in the olfactory bulb shortly after infection and before being detected in other brain regions, the investigators concluded that the olfactory nerve might act as a gateway that facilitates the SARS-CoV entry into the brain (159). In addition, impaired BBB integrity following SARS-CoV-induced alterations of brain microvascular endothelial TJs is also considered as a putative access point into the CNS (160).",
            "A recent report revealed that intact SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viral particles were detected in the olfactory mucosa and neuroanatomical olfactory tract projection areas, which may demonstrate that neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 is also achieved by axonal transport. Most importantly, this avenue of viral entry into the CNS does not exclude a concomitant virus-induced BBB disruption entry mechanism into the brain (161). Brain samples derived from four COVID-19 cases have shown neuronal cell loss and axon degeneration, particularly in the brainstem. Also, perivascular and interstitial immune cell infiltration has been observed in these brain samples (162). Interestingly, using a BrainSpheres model incubated with SARS-CoV-2 for 6 h, a recent study reported virus particles' entry into neuronal cell bodies and neurite structures (163). Another study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces axonal-somal Tau distribution and neuronal death (164).",
            "The second stage after the viral entry is its transport into the brain. This process needs special transporters or opportunistic strategies utilizing coexisting pathophysiological phenomena. Alteration of BBB integrity during infection may facilitate the entry of the SARS-CoV2 virus into the CNS, where it can then bind to ACE2 receptors of glial cells or neurons (142, 159). However, even though SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in brains of severe COVID-19 cases, the entry mechanism(s) remains unclear (165). It has been proposed that SARS-CoV-2 may infect the brain directly via axonal transport mediated by the olfactory nerve (166). Other possibilities for the virus entry into the brain include trafficking through the BBB using leukocytes as carriers or viral neuroinvasion through the GI tract (165, 167, 168).",
            "Furthermore, COVID-19 promotes a high intracranial level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mast cell activation, and neuroinflammation (169). SARS-CoV-2 induced neuroinflammatory response varies between patients and can be aggravated by many factors enhancing this process, including alcohol consumption and substance use disorders (170, 171). For instance, SARS-CoV-2 infection mediates loss of TJs, activation of mast cells, and inflammatory mediators released, all of which could cause neuroinflammation, edema, and bleedings, especially in patients who have concomitant neurodegenerative diseases (172, 173). Using a 3D tissue model of the BBB, it has been shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compromises the integrity of the endothelial barrier and increases the BBB permeability. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may activate brain endothelial cells and induce an inflammatory response, which subsequently could contribute to BBB dysfunction (174). An in vitro study showed that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein downregulated TJ proteins, including ZO-1, ZO-2, Claudin-5, and JAM-2 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (175). Taken together, changes in junctional protein integrity could result in BBB disruption (176).",
            "Interestingly, the reduced expression of TJ proteins was associated with an increase in cytokines level, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 (175). Indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is an inflammation suppressor expressed in many immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes, and microglia (177). SARS-CoV-2 infection results in aberrant IDO1-mediated inflammation. Thus, IDO1 may be involved in SARS-CoV-2 induced neurological complications (178). Inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) is an inflammatory mediator that has a protective role during inflammatory conditions (179). SARS-CoV-2 may interrupt glial iNOS protection and subsequently impair immune responses and induce COVID-19-associated neurological complications (178). Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a well-known gene involving in the immune response against viruses (180). It is expressed in macrophages and microglia. HLA plays a critical role in immune surveillance and foreign antigen elimination. SARS-CoV-2 may impact the protective function of HLA as a host immune defense (178).",
            "A study conducted on four COVID-19 patients with coexisting ischemic stroke has shown an elevated D-diameter (a lab test that measures fibrin degradation fragments) and C-reactive protein level (CRP, a protein produced by the liver in response to inflammation). These substances can induce thrombosis and play a role in the onset of ischemia (181, 182). A study comparing patients with COVID-19 and acute ischemic stroke to non-COVID-19 ischemic stroke patients observed that COVID-19 increases stroke severity worsens post-ischemic functional outcomes, and increases the mortality risk (183). Microvascular injury and fibrinogen leakage have also been observed in COVID-19 patients (184).",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted global public health and the economy. SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the physiological functions of several biological systems, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and nervous systems. The symptoms of COVID-19 range from asymptomatic to severe conditions. Intensive studies have focused on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the respiratory system. However, more research needs to be done to understand the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 affecting other organ systems, such as the CNS. There are significant gaps in the current understanding of whether SARS-CoV-2 attacks the CNS directly or through activation of the peripheral immune system and immune cell infiltration. Most recently, emerging evidence revealed that SARS-COV-2 is neuro-invasive (138, 144). Alteration of BBB integrity during infection may facilitate the SARS-CoV2 virus entering the CNS and binding to the ACE2 receptors of glial cells or neurons (142, 159). Although the modality of neurological impairments associated with COVID-19 has not been thoroughly investigated, the latest studies have observed that SARS-CoV-2 induces neuroinflammation and may have severe long-term consequences. Not surprisingly, the most frequent question circulating in this research field revolves around the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 underlying COVID-19-induced neurological disorders. This review's highlights summarize currently available data on cellular and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced neuroinflammation.",
            "The most recent reports showed that systemic infection leads to the activation of glial cells modulating neuroinflammatory responses, thus suggesting that the infiltration of immune cells and pro-inflammatory mediators into the CNS through the BBB are involved in glial activation following COVID-19 (185). Released cytokines, chemokines, and free radicals activate the immune cells within the CNS and promote oxidative stress. Excessive neuroinflammation contributes to neuronal death and neurodegenerative diseases (111, 186). In addition to the cytokine storm hypothesis, the most recent theory proposes that SARS-CoV-2 infection may induce downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme and the upregulation of ACE2, respectively. The angiotensin-converting enzyme causes the breakdown of bradykinin, and thus, lowering the angiotensin-converting enzyme during SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase the bradykinin levels. Subsequently, increased bradykinin induces vascular permeability (187). Taken together, the bradykinin storm could help explaining how SARS-CoV-2 leads to neuroinflammation and neurological impairment.",
            "Additionally, a better understanding of the pathological role of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS would be beneficial not only to develop effective treatments to protect the CNS from the harmful effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection but also to identify potential comorbidities and environmental clues that could worsen the neurological impact of COVID-19 itself (11, 188). In conclusion, activation of the innate immune system associated with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators seems a mainstream pathogenic occurrence in the COVID-19 pandemic. The viral-induced peripheral inflammatory response and the consequent release of cytokines, chemokines, and ROS disrupt the interendothelial TJ proteins and impair the BBB integrity, thus facilitating the trafficking of immune cells into the CNS. Recruitment of the immune cells in the brain promotes the activation of the CNS resident immune cells, such as microglia and astrocytes. Activation of these cells initiates a sustained neuroinflammatory response resulting in neuronal injury and neurodegenerative conditions. Several pieces of evidence strongly suggest the implication of a BBB impairment and loss of barrier integrity as a potential gateway facilitating the virus's passage into the CNS and the onset of neurological complications observed during the progression of the disease. It is also clear that additional gateways into the CNS for the viral entry are possibly in place, including SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion achieved through the olfactory nerve and/or axonal transport through the olfactory tract projections. IT is also clear that additional studies are necessary to better comprehend the dynamic of the whole process and the role of SARS-CoV-2-induced neuroinflammation. Understanding the complex events during this stage of the viral infection cycle is critical to identifying new pharmacological targets and developing more effective therapeutic interventions to protect the CNS.",

            "Neurons are the basic building blocks of the human body’s neurological system. Atrophy is defined by the disintegration of the connections between cells that enable them to communicate. Peripheral neuropathy and demyelinating disorders, as well as cerebrovascular illnesses and central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory diseases, have all been linked to brain damage, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). It turns out that these diseases have a direct impact on brain atrophy. However, it may take some time after the onset of one of these diseases for this atrophy to be clearly diagnosed. With the emergence of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there were several clinical observations of COVID-19 patients. Among those observations is that the virus can cause any of the diseases that can lead to brain atrophy. Here we shed light on the research that tracked the relationship of these diseases to the COVID-19 virus. The importance of this review is that it is the first to link the relationship between the Coronavirus and diseases that cause brain atrophy. It also indicates the indirect role of the virus in dystrophy.",
            "Cerebrovascular illness affects the brain’s blood flow and blood vessels. Blood flow issues may be caused by blood vessel constriction, clot development, artery blockage, or rupture. SARS-CoV-2 is an opportunistic brain infection that causes substantial respiratory distress, as well as neurological signs. COVID-19 is linked to symptoms including neurological complications and brain death.",
            "However, studies have shown that this virus may cause neurological problems, which can sometimes precede usual symptoms like a fever and a cough. It may cause serious problems, including cerebrovascular disease (CVA), convulsions, or paralysis. The virus has caused serious neurological symptoms in older people and severely ill patients. Furthermore, COVID-19 can cause damage to neurons and their synapses. In this case, the brain could shrink, which leads to a brain disease called atrophy. A semantic diagram is presented in Figure 1 to show a summary of this process. It also has a significant influence on global mental health [1].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 may trigger intrinsic and innate immunological responses in the host, including enhanced cytokine release, tissue damage, and high neurosusceptibility to COVID-19, particularly in hypoxic settings induced by lung injury. In immunocompromised people, the virus may enter the brain through the vasculature and peripheral nerves [2].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasal swabs and a computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed widespread enlargement of the brain stem. A woman in her 59th year visited the emergency room after experiencing recurrent, fleeting episodes of vacant staring and speech arrest. These symptoms were accompanied by flexion of both shoulders and a brief generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS), which was followed by postictal reduced consciousness. Due to her diminished state of awareness, she needed intubation and artificial ventilation.",
            "It was found that the patient’s health had worsened with symmetrical hemorrhagic lesions in the brain stem, amygdalae, and thalamic nuclei. The findings matched hemorrhagic ANE with early brain stem involvement. The patient died after eight days of steroid treatment [3]. Postmortem brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows hemorrhagic and Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)-related brain lesions in COVID-19 non-survivors, perhaps caused by virus-induced endothelium abnormalities and brainstem absence.",
            "COVID-19 MRI abnormalities do not support brain-related respiratory distress [4]. SARS-CoV-2 may target deeper brain regions such as the thalamus and brainstem via trans-synaptic transmission, as seen in other viral illnesses. The virus may then infect the respiratory center of the brain, causing respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients should be screened for neurological symptoms and the collapse of the respiratory center in the brainstem [5].",
            "The pandemic’s neurological effects are becoming clearer, and COVID-19 does not seem to pass the blood-brain barrier [6]. The ubiquitous danger to our desire for human connection may combine with “brain styles,” which we previously characterized as “biotypes” informed by a neural taxonomy, to explain the mental health repercussions of COVID-19. This essay aims to promote research on COVID-19’s mental health effects from an individualized, brain-based approach that recognizes the virus’s grave danger to our core human drives [7].",
            "Recent research shows that a cytokine storm promotes brain inflammation, and hence neurological symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic. Targeting brain inflammation may help cure SARS-CoV-2’s neurologic consequences. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which is extensively distributed in the brain, may have a role in brain inflammation by promoting the recruitment of inflammatory cells and regulating angiopoietin II levels [8]. The vast variety of neurologic imaging results underscores the necessity for future investigations to improve therapy for these individuals [9]. The involvement of medulla oblongata brainstem structures in food intake and vomiting control has been studied, as well as the virus’s probable neurotropic and hematogenous routes to the brainstem [10].",
            "Neurological exams are required for all SARS-CoV-2 patients, symptomatic or not, for COVID-19, and during hospitalization. Even after recovery from COVID-19, people should be considered at risk for neurological problems. Long-term neurologic monitoring following COVID-19 recovery will show whether this sickness is linked to treatable neurodegenerative illnesses.",
            "COVID-19 patients and their families should get mental health assistance when the condition has stabilized [11]. Many COVID-19 patients remain unconscious following a serious illness. We don’t know how structural brain abnormalities affect brain function or prognosis. This population has yet to be studied in terms of prognostic neuroimaging. Despite chronic non-responsiveness and anatomical brain abnormalities, a patient with severe COVID-19 showed intact functional network connections and, weeks later, regained command-following ability [12].",
            "There is a link between anxiety and cognitive impairment in SARS-CoV-2-infected people with moderate or no respiratory symptoms and changed cerebral cortical thickness. Of all COVID-19 deaths, 19% had brain injuries. SARS-CoV-2 foci were found in astrocytes in all the afflicted brain regions. Neurotransmitter synthesis and energy consumption are altered in neural stem cell-derived astrocytes infected with a secretory phenotype that lowers neuronal survival [13].",
            "Further study is required to understand the precise mechanisms and pathways of infectivity underpinning CNS pathology [14]. COVID-19 affects transcription in all cortical, parenchymal, and choroid plexus cell types. As a result of the SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cerebral vasculature and meninges, enhanced inflammatory signaling in the brain occurs. Parallel to this, peripheral immune cells penetrate the brain, microglia activate programs that mediate the phagocytosis of living neurons, and astrocytes dysregulate genes important in neurotransmitter balance. All these processes are part of the neuroinflammatory response [15]. COVID-19 symptoms may affect other organs, including the brain, and data on SARS-CoV-2 neuropathological characteristics is scarce [16].",
            "The effect of the COVID-19 quarantines on Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients in Tyrol was investigated to ensure that neurosurgical treatment is available even during pandemic lockdown [17]. The COVID-19 infection can cause severe pneumonia, as well as systemic thrombotic complications, including cerebrovascular disease [18]. Infections of the CNS cause aseptic meningitis or encephalitis. The respiratory system is the major target of COVID-19. However, it is also a neuropathogen. The hallmark clinical feature ranges from mild confusion to profound coma. Most encephalitis patients are severely ill [19]. SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain through olfactory nerves via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and cytokine storms, a process called “cell reprograming” [20]. As shown in Figure 2, there are six main diseases that can cause brain atrophy: cerebrovascular diseases, CNS inflammatory diseases, peripheral neuropathy, demyelinating disorders, and PD.",
            "During the process of looking for references that were cited, we began with references that we had read in the past and that were relevant to the subject of the review. Following that, looking for other publications that have mentioned that reference is the next step. To put it another way, the reference that we began with was quite pertinent to our study, and other publications may have mentioned references that are also pertinent to our study.",
            "An alternative to searching with keywords has been utilized. When searching using cited references and searching with specific search phrases, such as the title and author of the referenced reference, you can find what you need. The main aim of this review is to shed light on the indirect role of the COVID-19 virus in brain atrophy. There are several diseases that lead to this atrophy in varying proportions from one disease to another and from one person to another, such as cerebrovascular diseases, CNS inflammatory diseases, peripheral neuropathy, demyelinating disorders, and Parkinson’s disease. However, recent research has been able to find a relationship between these diseases and COVID-19. This should help scientists understand the indirect role of COVID-19 in brain atrophy.",
            "Inhibitions of COVID-19 receptor ACE2 expression in a high-risk cohort for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke will be discussed next. A functioning ACE2 receptor has recently been identified in COVID-19, which may cause serious cerebrovascular disorders, including strokes, in people with risk factors for severe cerebrovascular diseases (CVD), such as diabetes and smoking. The effects of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and hyperglycemia on ACE2 expression in arteries were studied in a rat MCAO model. After ischemic damage, the cortical penumbra expressed more ACE2. CSE increased ACE2 expression in the human brain vasculature. In diabetic primary cultured human blood vessels, ACE2 expression was increased [21]. Strokes have been reported in young people under fifty years old, with no cardiovascular risk factors associated with COVID-19. As of now, just a few instances have been reported, so it’s possible that the illness promotes its growth. Elderly people with stroke risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and increased fibrin D-dimers had higher cerebrovascular occurrences. COVID-19 contains several CVD cases reports and series. The mechanism that causes COVID-19 cerebral ischemia is unknown [22].",
            "While the presence of both respiratory and cerebral injuries would suggest a greater severity, COVID-19 stroke patients might present with minor or non-respiratory symptoms. The severity of anterior circulation big vessel blockage strokes in COVID-19 patients was compared. Anterior circulation, big artery blockages and early brain imaging within 3 h of commencement were compared to a control group hospitalized over the same calendar month in 2019. Patients with COVID-19 had more severe big vessel occlusion strokes. The pandemic’s neurovascular effects should be feared given the enormous number of afflicted patients [23].",
            "The pathogenetic effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the novel COVID-19 infection on the brain implies both direct and indirect harm. The goal of the research is to learn more about ischemic strokes in COVID-19 patients. Patients with COVID-19 need close monitoring of their coagulation system and aggressive thrombosis prevention. Providing ischemic stroke treatment in the context of COVID-19 adds to the organizational challenges, affecting intra-hospital logistics and care quality [24]. Stroke patients with COVID-19 had a 9-fold poorer prognosis than those without it [25]. SARS-CoV-2 induces COVID-19, a global condition. Swelling, cytokine storms, and an increase in heart injury biomarkers occur in the moderate and severe phases of infection. There may also be a link between COVID-19 and neurological problems. After being admitted to the Reanimation Unit, two patients with severe COVID-19 infection died. Moderate to severe COVID-19 patients should get high-dose antithrombotic prophylaxis [26].",
            "COVID-19 seems to cause neurological complications, including bleeding and infarction. Individuals who are at high risk of coagulopathy should be investigated, but the risk of bleeding must be considered. Patients with COVID-19 should also have stringent blood pressure management. Acute cerebral infarction in COVID-19 individuals should be treated with thrombolytics [27].",
            "According to reports, patients with COVID-19 have suffered from benign intracranial hypertension, seizures, ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disorders, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, meningitis, and delirium. SARS-CoV-2 involvement in the central nervous system may worsen neurodegenerative problems in the future. The SARS-CoV-2 virus may harm the CNS. In turn, this leads to more severe symptoms and a higher chance of negative consequences [28]. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to infect the CNS. The existing research on its neurological symptoms and pathological processes has not been systematic.",
            "Patients may present with encephalopathy, encephalitis, seizures, cerebrovascular events, acute polyneuropathy, headache, hypogeusia, hyposmia, and other non-specific symptoms. However, they may indicate direct SARS-CoV-2-related neuronal injury [29]. COVID-19 has been linked to ischemic strokes. There is an increasing indication that COVID-19 effects extend beyond the lungs. Cerebrovascular disease is one of the most common neurologic symptoms [30].",
            "The following aspects of cerebrovascular disease in COVID-19 patients will be discussed next: imaging, histology, and clinical features. There is a 1.4% incidence of cerebral vascular accident (CVA) in COVID-19 patients with substantial morbidity and death. Endotheliopathy with a haemorrhagic propensity has been linked to thrombotic microangiopathy [31]. SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause significant and multi-site vascular involvement. Results were classified as “relevant” or “other/incidental,” indicating the necessity for prompt patient care and treatment. The study groups were compared using the Student T-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, or Fisher exact test. Vascular involvement is not overlooked in COVID-19 and may have a substantial impact on disease behavior and prognosis [32].",
            "The top protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the ACE2 receptor. Twelve nucleotides are inserted into the S-polyphasic protein’s furin cleavage side at S1/S2 to slow down six receptor-binding domain (RBD) amino acids. Children with severe COVID-19 infections may benefit from angiotensin II receptor blockers [33].",
            "Brainstem perivascular lymphocytic infiltration and microthrombi are common neurological consequences in COVID-19 patients, although little neuropathological research exists. A recent case report identified neocortical infarcts with tiny haemorrhagic and non-haemorrhagic white matter lesions, suggesting an evolving pattern of distinctive changes, which were also detected radiologically [34].",
            "COVID-19 targets the lungs, causing an abrupt respiratory collapse. COVID-19 neurological symptoms include strokes, encephalitis, and neuropathy. The aspects of multiple sclerosis patient treatment during the COVID-19 epidemic are described [35]. Although SARS-CoV-2 usually affects the lungs, neurological symptoms are becoming more common. In three case studies of brain autopsies, no consistent pathobiological mechanism of CNS involvement in severe COVID-19 has been documented. Acute strokes, herniation, or olfactory bulb injuries were not seen [36].",
            "Neuronal degeneration in COVID-19 individuals includes non-specific alterations in nerve cells. COVID-19 victims’ brain histopathology shows CNS impairment. Hypoxia from respiratory failure and individual risk factors including cerebrovascular atherosclerosis and hypertension induce ischemic strokes in COVID-19 patients [37]. SARS-CoV-2, which produced COVID-19, was recently found in postmortem neural and capillary endothelial cells of the frontal lobe of a patient. Seizures and early Guilli-an-Barre-like symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 patients have prompted concerns regarding the possible effects of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion. The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown [38]. Two COVID-19 patients had structural brainstem injuries. Two COVID-19-dead patients and two COVID-19-negative patients were studied for neuropathological characteristics. Histopathological, CA/mm2 and neuronal injury were measured. The medulla oblongata of COVID-19 patients had greater neuronal damage. SARS-CoV-2 in the brainstem and medullary damage in respiratory centers clearly imply a neurogenic component to COVID-19-related respiratory failure pathogenesis. This suggests viral trafficking between the brainstem and lungs [39].",
            "Several processes in the neurological system cause such manifestations. Virus-induced hyperinfammatory and hypercoagulable states are frequent examples. COVID-19 peripheral nervous system (PNS) diseases include Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and its variations, sensory impairment (taste and smell), and muscular damage. CNS illnesses caused by COVID-19 include hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes, meningitis, encephalopathy, endotheliosis, and venous sinus thrombosis [40].",
            "The diagnosis and treatment of cranial mononeuropathies, acute inflammatory Guillain-Barre polyneuritis, and severe brain and spinal cord damage caused by acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy and myelopathies. SARS-CoV-2 has neurotropic and neurovirulence properties, and the combined impact of these variables, may produce neurological problems in COVID-19. COVID-19 influences chronic neurological illnesses, including neuroimmune diseases [41].",
            "The Miller-Fischer variety of Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute peripheral neuropathy caused by viruses, bacteria, and fungi. It causes ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. Miller-Fischer syndrome has recently been characterized in the clinical scenario of COVID-19 [42]. A 60-year-old man with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but only mild respiratory problems, developed akinetic mutism because of encephalitis. Electroencephalography revealed a global theta slowing. Interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor concentrations were raised in the acute stage of SARS-CoV-2 [43]. Figure 3 shows a schematic diagram of the main neurological symptoms of COVID-19.",
            "Three months after the SARS-CoV-2 infection, up to 55% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients had neurological abnormalities. Its mutability and propensity to directly influence the CNS underlines the need to create technology to identify, manage, and treat COVID-19 patients’ brain injuries. The pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 CNS infection, as well as its neurological consequences, remain unknown [44]. There have been four instances of COVID-19 encephalopathy. In COVID-19, individuals with new-onset cognitive problems, central focal neurological symptoms, or seizures were diagnosed. All patients had cognitive testing, MRI, and A fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) / computerized tomography (CT) [45].",
            "Human COVID-19 individuals show neurological abnormalities, both clinically and histologically. These symptoms may contribute to the disease’s morbidity and mortality, or perhaps signify the initiation of neurodegenerative activity in recovered individuals. COVID-19 enters cells via ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 may cause mild, moderate, or severe respiratory symptoms, leading to death. The viral receptor is found in the lungs, kidney, colon, and brain. Viral invasion causes cellular damage that leads to inflammation and decreases the activity of ACE2, which governs neuroprotective, neuro-immunomodulatory, and oxidative stress neutralizing capabilities. Hypoxemia occurs when patients are not given appropriate breathing assistance. The patient’s neurological symptoms will depend on characteristics such as age and sex, as well as the mechanism of neuronal invasion, the immunological response, and overall health [46].",
            "Although the clinical signs are well understood, scientists are still unsure how SARS-CoV-2 enters and spreads throughout the CNS, causing brain injury. SARS-CoV-2 was recently found in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and frontal lobe slices from postmortem examinations, confirming its presence in neural tissue. In COVID-19 patients with underlying illnesses, this data points to a potential neurotherapeutic approach [47].",
            "Coexisting microvascular alterations and upstream vascular tone all impact tissue oxygenation in critical organs. Infection and hypoxia-related inflammation impairs capillary function, which in turn increases hypoxia-related inflammation and tissue damage [48]. Initial structural neuroimaging investigations revealed widespread encephalopathies and damage to the medial temporal areas. Studies demonstrate that up to six months after hospitalization, over 30% of patients have cognitive deterioration and over 20% have serious mood control issues. Ongoing research in functional neuroimaging has confirmed anatomical results in frontal dysfunction.",
            "An electroencephalogram (EEG) investigation has shown higher deltas in frontal areas that match these results. In COVID-19, individuals with seizures, temporal, frontotemporal, and central-parietal focal zones have been discovered. Acute COVID-19 exposure and the neuroinflammatory effects of the COVID vaccine on non-exposed neurotypical individuals will be discussed. Current COVID-19 and future variant vaccines may stimulate the immune system, causing cytokine storms and neuroinflammatory consequences in certain people [49]. A 47-year-old man was taken to a hospital after suffering from worsening vertigo and ataxia for 7 days. The neurologic exam indicated cerebellar impairment, and the MRI showed cerebellar hemisphere edema with leptomeningeal enhancement. The Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indicated minor lymphocytic pleocytosis, protein, and lactate dehydrogenase elevations. CSF specimens had SARS-CoV-2 RNA. During hospitalization, the patients’ symptoms and signs improved significantly with lopinavir/ritonavir treatment [50]. Cerebral vasculitis-associated arterial vessel wall thickening was seen in 11 (16%) of the 69 COVID-19 patients. The difference between the 25 patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection was statistically significant (p = 0.03). The most often implicated vessels were the basilar and posterior cerebral arteries. Imaging revealed ischemia or hemorrhagic problems in nine. Cerebral vasculitis of medium-sized arteries seems to be one cause of COVID-19 brain injury [51].",
            "Encephalopathy and encephalitis are severe SARS-CoV-2 CNS consequences. Hypoxic/metabolic alterations caused by the virus cause cytokine storms, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failure. Hypoxic/metabolic encephalopathy is common among the elderly and seriously unwell. Comorbidities predispose patients to hypoxic/metabolic alterations that cause encephalopathy. These patients often need mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) [52].",
            "A higher incidence of serious neurological illnesses, such as encephalitis, is associated with COVID-19. Immunopathology and colonization of the intestine and central nervous system caused by SARS-CoV-2, as well as a systemic inflammatory response during COVID-19, may result in long-term autoimmune and neurological disorders. Neurodegenerative Parkinson’s disease involves both motor and non-motor symptoms [53]. The relationship between COVID-19 and PD is intriguing for many reasons. More than two decades ago, Coronavirus antibodies were discovered in the CSF of PD patients, suggesting a viral involvement in neurodegeneration [54].",
            "As dopamine neurons have high ACE2 receptor expression and Parkinson’s disease has low ACE2 receptor expression due to degeneration, SARS-CoV-2–related brain penetration may cause additional injury, exacerbate symptoms, and increase the need for dopamine replacement therapy, as seen in 5 of the patients. As a result of Coronaviruses’ propensity to reach the brain via the nasal cavity, many infected people suffer from anosmia, hyposmia, and ageusia, which is a precursory sign of PD. As ACE2 and dopamine decarboxylase co-express and co-regulate in nonneuronal cell types, this may signal dopamine depletion and the need for levodopa therapy. The outcomes of SARS-CoV-2-infected PD patients are uncertain [54].",
            "Unlike the 1918 influenza pandemic and the avian flu, COVID-19 has had few reports of encephalopathy and just one instance of Parkinson’s. Consensus guidelines for the clinical management of Parkinson’s patients with COVID-19 are suggested. However, specific motor and non-motor symptoms have been observed, and it will be crucial to follow participants after recovery, especially those with persistent hysteria [55].",
            "COVID-19 has impacted everyone, particularly those with chronic conditions like Parkinson’s (PD). COVID-19 may influence PD patients’ motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms. COVID-19 was found in 18.18% of PD patients who had DBS.",
            "There was no link between illness duration and COVID-19 prevalence. There was a statistically significant increase in COVID-19 prevalence in PD patients who had direct contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected people. There is no statistically significant link between deteriorating motor symptoms and COVID-19. Anxiety and sleep difficulties are common in PD patients, and COVID-19 may influence their psychological health. PD patients may have stricter preventative procedures, resulting in a lower prevalence and severity of COVID-19 and its effects. A more precise study is needed to determine if COVID-19 has any impact on the motor or psychosocial elements of PD [56].",
            "Patients with deep brain stimulation face special hurdles because of the new Coronavirus illness (COVID-19) pandemic and public health initiatives to stop it using deep brain stimulation (DBS). During the countrywide lockdown from April to May 2020, patients with DBS had movement problems. There was an initial exacerbation of symptoms in two patients with subthalamic nucleus DBS for PD and one with globus pallidus interna DBS for generalized dystonia [57].",
            "COVID-19 infection following SARS coronavirus 2 infection may cause significant pregnancy complications that affect neonatal outcomes. Physiological adaptations make pregnant women more vulnerable to cell-mediated viral infections. Pregnant women with COVID-19 are admitted to the An intensive care unit (ICU) at a slightly greater rate than non-pregnant women. Hypoxemia caused by maternal respiratory insufficiency may induce fetal distress. Amniotic fluid, fetal blood, chorionic villi, and fetal CSF samples were obtained for virological and genetic testing.",
            "Atrophic cerebral cortex, dilated ventricles, hydrocephalus, and intraventricular hemorrhage were found at autopsy. Acute hypoxia induces changes in the whole CNS. Fetoplacental inflammation or microangiopathy were not detected [58]. Based on the COVID-19 pandemic, newborn SARS-CoV-2 infections are typically mild. There is weak data on how maternal infection impacts fetal development. An unusual instance of an intermediate-preterm child with cerebral hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia was reported [59].",
            "The Healthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Study is an enormous longitudinal project that is co-funded by the Helping to End Addiction Long-Term (HEAL) Initiative of the National Institutes of Health, as well as several other institutes. Women from comparable environmental and socioeconomic backgrounds will be included in the HBCD sample, as will those with lower-risk profiles. The HBCD project will be able to analyze the developmental repercussions of neonatal medication withdrawal, which presently affects 8 out of every 1000 infants delivered in hospitals in the US. The HBCD sample will be racially and socioeconomically varied to capture a spectrum of developmental effects [60].",
            "COVID-19 pandemic period pregnancies have been linked to poor fetal brain development and delayed cerebral cortical gyrification. Abnormal fetal brain development may have long-term neurodevelopmental consequences in COVID-era pregnancies compounded by increased mother anxiety [61]. All patients tested negative for N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), and aquaporin-4 autoantibodies. All three individuals had modest myopathic and neuropathic alterations on nerve conduction tests and electromyography. All patients showed neurological improvement, with two making a full recovery. On imaging, children with COVID-19 showed novel neurological symptoms involving the central and peripheral nervous systems but no respiratory symptoms [62]. Figure 4 shows the major neurologic complications of COVID-19.",
            "Brain dysfunction may be caused by neuroplasticity in the nerves. The radiofrequency (RF) radiation from smartphones is unlikely to cause brain tumors in young people. The increased use may affect brain functioning, impair sleep and cognitive capacities, and increase the risk of mental diseases like depression, anxiety, Alzheimer’s disease, and ADHD [63]. Unusual brain development during pregnancy increases the likelihood of later mental illness. It is modeled in animals by maternal immune activation.",
            "Like other known respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 causes maternal inflammation during pregnancy. Choline, folic acid, vitamin D, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have all been researched as potential anti-infective and anti-inflammatory nutrients for pregnant women. The literature on their use in infected pregnant women is reviewed. Infants born to mothers who had viral infections in the first trimester benefit from higher maternal choline levels.",
            "No other nutrient has been investigated in viral inflammation. Some research shows vitamin D decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines. Fluoride reduces anti-inflammatory cytokines. Unsaturated fatty acids have little impact [64]. Microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells, are influenced by the intrauterine environment, including maternal immune activity and inflammatory exposures. The COVID-19 pandemic presents a developmental immunological challenge to the embryonic brain, particularly when combined with maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may result in cytokine storming. Therefore, they are unavailable throughout fetal life and after delivery; therefore, there is no existing biomarker or model for in utero microglial priming and function [65].",
            "COVID-19 normally causes a moderate illness in children, although major consequences such as the multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children may arise (MIS-C). Adults have reported neurological symptoms ranging from moderate headaches to seizures, peripheral neuropathy, stroke, demyelinating diseases, and encephalopathy. The neurological consequences of COVID-19 appear to vary depending on age and underlying comorbidities [66].",
            "The Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2) The Parent Rating Scale was used to calculate connections between brain anatomy and internalizing and externalizing behavior. Internalizing behavior was linked to bilateral cingulum mean diffusivity (MD). In the cingulum, females had higher positive associations between MD and internalizing behavior. The left cingulum exhibited an age–behavior relationship, whereas the left uncinate fasciculus showed an age–behavior interaction. No behavior-brain volume associations survived multiple comparison corrections [67].",
            "Defective brain connections are present in both Alzheimer’s patients [68,69].",
            "The global proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 may have implications for Alzheimer’s disease. Neuroinflammation plays a role in Alzheimer’s etiology. The immunological response and increased inflammation caused by COVID-19 make elderly people more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. [70]. Many genetic risk variants have been linked to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Anatomical models of the hippocampus, the primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and lateral temporal lobe (LTL) These networks link AD SNPs to transcription factors and regulatory elements to uncover target genes linked to various AD symptoms. Machine learning techniques prioritize AD-COVID genes. The AD-COVID genes outperformed the known COVID-19 genes in predicting COVID severity and choosing patients for critical care [71].",
            "Interpersonal interaction with COVID19 increases mortality in AD clinical trial participants. Clinical trials to prevent or treat Alzheimer’s disease still depend heavily on in-person cognitive testing. The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADASCog) can be administered remotely with some adaptations and considerations. A novel technique to manage ADASCog’s virtual environment [72] Contrary to popular belief, professional tests frequently show neurological and cognitive issues. Seizures’ frequency, duration, and neurological cause are uncertain. These infections seem to harm the hippocampus, increasing the likelihood of memory loss and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s [73].",
            "Despite concerns regarding acceptable utilization by the elderly and the limits of evaluation without direct patient contact, the emergency phase gave an essential chance to examine telemedicine. Psychological and cognitive exams, as well as specialist professional figures, will be required to monitor and better comprehend the impacts of the ageing population [74]. The COVID-19 infection necessitates long-term neurological monitoring of COVID-19 patients, especially the elderly and sick. In this case, biomarkers can monitor COVID-19 patients for neurological problems like Alzheimer’s [75].",
            "Twenty-three individuals with COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction were assessed in [76]. A month elapsed between the beginning of the olfactory impairment and the examination. The Sniffin’ Sticks Test was used to assess olfactory function. We obtained olfactory nerve CTs and MRIs of the paranasal sinus. In MRIs, olfactory bulb volumes and sulcus depths were quantified, whereas morphology, signal intensity, and olfactory nerve filia architecture were assessed qualitatively. Based on olfactory tests, all patients were anosmic at the time of immaturity.",
            "This was discovered on CT in 73.9 percent of patients, with mid- and posterior-segment dominance. Of the patients, 43.5 percent had small olfactory bulbs, and 60.9 percent had shallow sulci. In 54.2 percent of instances, the bulb’s usual inverted J shape changed. Ninety-three percent of patients showed diffusely elevated signal intensity, distributed hyperintense foci, or microhemorrhages. The olfactory bulb degradation rate was high. Further longitudinal imaging investigations may reveal the cause of olfactory neural circuit impairment [76].",
            "Two additional participants with substantial odor abnormalities had mucosal hyperplasia of the upper nasal canals. Two participants with excellent scent restoration had no MRI anomalies. Olfactory system abnormalities may be the cause of anasmia in COVID-19 individuals [77].",
            "Six individuals had bilateral olfactory cleft blockages, whereas three had minor olfactory bulb asymmetry. No MRI signal abnormalities were seen downstream of the olfactory tract. The core olfactory and high-order neocortical regions showed heterogeneous glucose metabolism problems. Using correlation analysis, we discovered that COVID-19-related dysosmia severity and duration affect regional cerebral glucose metabolism. The abrupt loss of smell in COVID-19 is not attributable to SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasiveness.",
            "Lack of olfactory input causes deafferentation and active functional reconfiguration in core olfactory and high-order cortical regions, resulting in metabolic alterations [78]. Identifying COVID-19 symptoms, particularly in the “asymptomatic” stage, and understanding the underlying molecular pathways will aid in establishing better prevention and treatment strategies. Given COVID-19’s expected second peak and its cyclical nature, taking action now would be prudent. Validated scoring tests for anosmia and dysgeusia is needed. Future research with large cohorts will help determine whether anosmia and dysgeusia are early COVID-19 indications that may assist in triaging confirmatory testing or implementing social distance and mask-wearing to limit community spread [79].",
            "There is emerging evidence that COVID-19 patients have olfactory impairments. Anosmia may arise alone or in conjunction with other COVID-19 symptoms, including a dry cough. The underlying cause of olfactory impairment in COVID-19 individuals is unknown. Multiple cross-sectional investigations have shown that olfactory dysfunction occurs in 33.9–68 percent of COVID-19 patients, with a female predominance. COVID-19 patients often have anosmia and dysgeusia. Anosmia in outpatients should be noted by otolaryngologists to avoid the COVID-19 diagnosis [80].",
            "Brain psychology and neurology both influence the brain. The stress caused by COVID-19 astounded and concerned medical experts and the general population. Headaches, sleeplessness, olfactory and gustatory impairments, and more severe encephalopathy were all associated with the COVID-19 neuroinvasion. The COVID-19 infection boosted immunity, resulting in severe lung and brain inflammation, with the former being the leading cause of COVID-19 death and the latter potentially leading to cerebral hemorrhage.",
            "Hypercoagulation and aneurysm instability, which may be aggravated by systemic COVID-19 inflammation, may have a role in the development of mental illness. During the COVID-19 epidemic, people acquired behavioral patterns to cope with anxiety and stress, and they were more inclined to seek health information online, such as wearing face masks and washing their hands. To make the immune system more resistant to COVID-19, people were told to live a balanced life and get therapy [81].",
            "Doctors and other healthcare practitioners may do regular motor function testing prior to an epidemic, monitor changes in cognition, mood, behavior, or quality of life, alter or titrate stimulation settings, and physically check battery life.",
            "The bulk of these key therapeutic components are now accessible online, allowing patients to exercise more control and autonomy over their therapy. This substantial step forward in patient stimulation control is part of a broader attempt to establish a balance between battery conservation and symptom alleviation [82].",
            "Allowing patients to “tweak” their therapy and experiment with different minimum thresholds within a safe range enables clinicians to “tweak” their treatment. Lockdown restriction measures have been associated with subjective worsening of motor and mental symptoms in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease or dystonia, implying that they may have exacerbated the burden of neurological illness and chronic stress associated with DBS treatment [83].",
            "COVID-19 has been associated with delirium, acute and chronic attention, memory issues, and learning difficulties in adults and children because of hippocampal and cortical damage [84]. While the biology of COVID-19 infection and its long-term clinical outcomes are unknown, approaching the pandemic with lessons learned from previous infectious disease outbreaks and the biology of other coronaviruses will pave the way for the development of public mental health strategies that can be positively translated into therapeutic approaches aimed at improving stress coping responses, thereby aiding in pandemic alleviation [84].",
            "COVID-19 has been linked to 123 distinct kinds of brain diseases, resulting in a complicated disease-disease network. By contrast, COVID-19 infection is more complex, with five closely packed modules, according to the brain-disease-gene network. The network’s hub proteins perform several functions, including catabolism of proteins, cell cycle regulation, RNA metabolism, and nuclear transport.",
            "Since drug repurposing affects these hub proteins, it improves therapy outcomes, such as comorbidity. According to doctors, people who test positive for COVID-19 are more likely to develop a range of additional neurological issues. To help minimize SARS-CoV-2’s long-term health implications, researchers must first understand the virus’s infection pathways and associated comorbidities [85].",
            "Second, due to social isolation, many individuals who need mental health therapy are unable to get it. There is an urgent need for more accessible mental health treatment throughout the COVID-19 self-isolation period. Neurotherapeutics are increasingly available for home administration. Today, most in-home mental health treatment options are based on telehealth, which involves therapists communicating with patients through phone or video.",
            "Other treatments, such as self-administered, at-home brain stimulation, must be developed and made immediately available to aid in minimizing the negative mental health repercussions of self-isolation. One alternative is to employ existing therapeutic brain stimulation technologies for depression treatment on a home-based basis [86].",
            "A growing collection of evidence suggests that the virus can infect the nervous system. Postmortem examinations have shown edema, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, atrophy, encephalitis, infarcts, swollen axons, myelin loss, gliosis, neuronal satellitosis, hypoxic-ischemic damage, arteriolosclerosis, leptomeningeal inflammation, neuronal loss, and axon degeneration [87]. Additionally, the COVID-19 epidemic is wreaking havoc on global mental health, which may be explained in part by its cultural ramifications. Environmental variables may have contributed to the pandemic’s increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders, which are aggravated by psychological disorders. While performing clinical trials and identifying SARS-CoV-2-associated neurologic diseases are challenging challenges, they are crucial for understanding how COVID-19 manifests and burdens neurological and mental symptoms during and after the pandemic [87].",
            "Numerous underlying autoantigens and their molecular similarities to SARS-CoV-2 are unknown. Autoantibodies may now be utilized to explain some aspects of COVID-19’s multiorgan sickness and to guide treatment in a subset of patients [88]. Virus infections have a substantial impact on brain functions and have the potential to cause serious neurological damage. Coronaviruses (CoV), most notably SARS-CoV-2, have been demonstrated to have neurotropic characteristics and the ability to cause neurological disorders. CoV was discovered in the brain and CSF fluid, according to research. Due to the unknown pathobiology of these neuroinvasive viruses, study into the neurological repercussions of CoV infection is crucial [89].",
            "The COVID-19 news reporting variance was associated with a variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer online visits. While widespread changes in mental health and behavior are to be expected, recognizing them is crucial for establishing strategies aimed at mitigating the mental health repercussions of future disasters [90].",
            "The COVID-19 infection is neurologically like the SARS-CoV-2 illness in terms of neurological symptoms. Despite its propensity to infect the neurological system directly, SARS-CoV-2 has been found in the CSF just twice [91]. To explain the clinical relevance of SARS-neuropathogenicity CoV-2s and to assess the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on common neurological illnesses, globally standardized registries are required [91]. Individuals with COVID-19 often have neurological difficulties.",
            "When treating patients with neurologic symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors should consider coronavirus infection as a differential diagnosis to avoid unnecessary delays or misdiagnosis, and to avoid missing an opportunity to cure and prevent future transmission [92]. COVID-19 is a virus that has the potential to infect the central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as other organs. In people of all ages, COV generates similar neurologic symptoms, with headaches (16.8 percent), dizziness (13.9 percent), and altered awareness being the most prevalent (13.9 percent).",
            "The virus’s neurotropic potential is demonstrated in 11.2 percent of CoV infections of the CNS through the production of numerous cytokines and possibly immune system failure [93]. Physicians and other healthcare providers may notice COVID-19 neurologic signs in patients who are at high risk. COVID-19 may be aimed at the neurological system because of the higher occurrence of olfactory and taste disorders, myalgia, headaches, and acute cerebral vascular disease. Two of the most prevalent entry sites into the neurological system are cytokine production and blood circulation [94].",
            "According to the current study, COVID-19 patients may have neurologic symptoms before, during, or even after the onset of typical COVID-19 symptoms. Dizziness, headaches, myalgia, weariness, altered awareness, disorientation, ageusia, anosmia, neuropathic or radicular pain, occipital neuralgia, visual impairment, seizures, and ataxia are only a few of the most frequently encountered neurological symptoms and signs. COVID-19 may cause GBS, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and acute myelitis by damaging the CNS, PNS, and skeletal muscles, according to an increasing number of case reports and research. The actual cause of these issues is unknown. The nervous system communicates directly with itself. Infection with SARS-CoV-2, neuroinflammation, a post-viral immunological response, hypercoagulability, and metabolic or hypoxic damage have all been suggested as possible causes [95].",
            "Even though other betacoronaviruses have comparable characteristics, only a few studies have shown SARS-CoV-2 brain infection in vivo. A neuronal and hematogenous bridging of the blood–brain barrier has been postulated considering recent discoveries that SARS-CoV-2 host cell entrance receptors exist as components of human neurons and vascular tissue. COVID-19 neurological symptoms may be a consequence of both the neuroinflammation generated by the “cytokine storm” and coexisting diseases.",
            "Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 may reach the brain through a variety of different channels, or it may be implicated in the development of neurological symptoms via a variety of different processes. [96]. The analysis excluded patients with missing or non-contributory brain MRI data, ischemic infarctions, cerebral venous thrombosis, or chronic abnormalities unrelated to the present incidence. To compare categorical data, the Fisher exact test was utilized. Patients with elevated COVID-19 levels, but no evidence of ischemia infarction, had a variety of neurologic symptoms, as well as an abnormal brain MRI [97]. There have been eight distinct neuroradiological patterns.",
            "The researchers used fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD),axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD), as well as an index grading system, to grade diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We compared regional volumes estimated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to DTI data using covariance analysis (ANCOVA). The correlations between imaging indices, index scores, and clinical data were determined using a two-sample t-test and Spearman correlation. Findings at this point in the trial show 55% of COVID-19 participants reported neurological symptoms [98].",
            "The most common neuroimaging findings are acute infarcts with a high clot load and cerebral bleeding, including microhemorrhages. Each of these imaging patterns is possible in leukoencephalopathy, global hypoxia, acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, corpus callosum cytotoxic lesions, olfactory bulb involvement, cranial nerve enhancement, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Immunological activation is the most common cause of central nervous system disease, since it results in a prothrombotic state and a cytokine storm; direct neuro-invasion is unusual [99]. A growing collection of evidence suggests that the virus can infect the nervous system.",
            "Postmortem examinations have shown edema, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, atrophy, encephalitis, infarcts, swollen axons, myelin loss, gliosis, neuronal satellitosis, hypoxic-ischemic damage, arteriolosclerosis, leptomeningeal inflammation, neuronal loss, and axon degeneration. While clinical exams to detect neurological issues associated with SARS-CoV-2 are tough, they are necessary to have a better knowledge of COVID-19’s presentation and burden of neurological and mental symptoms during and after the pandemic [100].",
            "COVID-19 patients with recovered frontal gray matter volumes, increased white matter hyperintensities, and decreased MD in total, and normal-appearing white matter in the posterior thalamic radiation and sagittal stratum had decreased MD in total and normal-appearing white matter compared to controls. These alterations were more pronounced in recipients of organ transplants.",
            "The T2* levels in the thalamus were shown to be increased in recovered COVID-19 patients, with the rise being greatest in non-critical patients [101]. COVID-19, or its concurrent prescription, has been linked to a specific pattern of microbleeds in the brain, most notably in the corpus callosum, according to brain MRI. Thrombotic microangiopathy caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as hypoxemia-induced collapse of the brain blood barrier, should be investigated [102]. Vascular injury, particularly to microvessels, is theorized to occur. The underlying mechanisms, which include viral infection of the central nervous system and systemic cardiovascular problems, are unclear, and there is no evidence of a causal relationship with SARS-CoV-2 infection [103].",
            "In the human body’s neurological system, neuronal cells serve as the fundamental building blocks. When cell-to-cell contact is disrupted, the affected area loses its capacity to function. In addition to peripheral neuropathy and demyelinating illnesses, there is a substantial link between Parkinson’s disease and several other ailments. An inverse relationship has been shown between these conditions and the shrinking of the brain. After a period of infection with one of these illnesses, it may take some time before the atrophy is detected.",
            "The virus can cause any of the disorders that were previously linked to brain shrinkage in research. The findings of our study will allow us to have a better understanding of the relationship between these illnesses and the COVID-19 virus. In this review, it was discovered that there was a link between the coronavirus and illnesses that cause brain shrinkage for the first time. It also seems to show that the virus plays a less direct role in the development of muscular dystrophy.",
            "In the future, meta-analysis will be carried out, and additional research should be investigated to justify the reason for the spread of the virus and possible preventative measures. As a result, additional efforts should be made to collect and organize all the information available on the COVID-19 disease from its various sources. A thorough look at the data from retrospective cohort studies and a discussion of where COVID-19 came from, its pathophysiology, epidemiology, and possible entry points for SARS-CoV-2 into the brain are also part of the report.",

            "The unprecedented pandemic of COVID-19 swept millions of lives in a short period, yet its menace continues among its survivors in the form of post-COVID syndrome. An exponentially growing number of COVID-19 survivors suffer from cognitive impairment, with compelling evidence of a trajectory of accelerated aging and neurodegeneration. The novel and enigmatic nature of this yet-to-unfold pathology demands extensive research seeking answers for both the molecular underpinnings and potential therapeutic targets. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death, is a strongly proposed underlying mechanism in post-COVID-19 aging and neurodegeneration discourse. COVID-19 incites neuroinflammation, iron dysregulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, antioxidant system repression, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) disruption, and clock gene alteration. These events pave the way for ferroptosis, which shows its signature in COVID-19, premature aging, and neurodegenerative disorders. In the search for a treatment, melatonin shines as a promising ferroptosis inhibitor with its repeatedly reported safety and tolerability. According to various studies, melatonin has proven efficacy in attenuating the severity of certain COVID-19 manifestations, validating its reputation as an anti-viral compound. Melatonin has well-documented anti-aging properties and combating neurodegenerative-related pathologies. Melatonin can block the leading events of ferroptosis since it is an efficient anti-inflammatory, iron chelator, antioxidant, angiotensin II antagonist, and clock gene regulator. Therefore, we propose ferroptosis as the culprit behind the post-COVID-19 trajectory of aging and neurodegeneration and melatonin, a well-fitting ferroptosis inhibitor, as a potential treatment.",
            "Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed millions of lives and left its extended mark on a large number of its survivors as a post-COVID syndrome [1]. Post-COVID syndrome, long COVID, or post-acute sequelae (PASC) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, all refer to a multi-system affection including neurological, cognitive, and psychiatric manifestations that persist for more than 12 weeks after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of illness severity, and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis [2–5]. The most common clinical manifestations include fatigue, anxiety, depression, headache, and cognitive impairment [6]. In a review of twelve studies, the overall prevalence of post-COVID-19 manifestations ranged from 35% to 90.5% [7]. The incidence of post-COVID syndrome six months after recovery from acute infection among 236,379 patients was 33.6% (95% CI: 33.17–34.07) and 46.4% (44.78–48.09) in patients who have been admitted to an intensive care unit [8]. The incidence of a first diagnosis of dementia in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 1·6% (95% CI: 1.2–2.1) in people older than 65 years [9]. Another study from the same group assessed the risks of 14 neurological and psychiatric diagnoses after SARS-CoV-2 infection in 1,487,712 COVID-19 patients and compared these risks with the matched comparator cohort of patients with other respiratory infections. The authors reported that while the risks of common psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression returned to baseline after 1–2 months, the risks of cognitive deficits and dementia continued to increase at the end of the 2-year follow-up period [10]. Indeed, cognitive impairment is the single most reported complaint by patients with post-COVID syndrome [11–13]. What is more alarming than presenting with cognitive impairment is the potential of setting off a bleak trajectory of underlying accelerated brain aging and neurodegenerative disorders, which necessitates being equipped with knowledge of both the molecular underpinnings and the potential solutions. Here, we postulate a mechanistic hypothesis for the post-COVID-19 trajectory of aging and neurodegeneration. We present neuroinflammation, iron dysregulation, and ferroptosis, iron-dependent cell death, as a shared poisonous recipe. We portray melatonin in a new light and show how it fits perfectly as a ferroptosis inhibitor in such a predicament. We first discuss an overview of the underlying pathophysiology of ferroptosis. Next, we present the current evidence on the post-COVID-19 trajectory of brain aging and neurodegeneration. Finally, we provide a mechanistic hypothesis for melatonin as a ferroptosis inhibitor in the post-COVID-19 trajectory of aging and neurodegeneration.",
            "A decade ago, Dixon et al. coined the term ferroptosis after observing a genetically, morphologically, and biochemically distinctive cell death phenotype in cultured cancer cells and in glutamate-induced neuronal cell death. They introduced ferroptosis as an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic form of regulated cell death [14]. Ferroptosis, unlike other forms of cell death that need a direct trigger molecule, occurs as a result of an imbalance between the cellular oxidative media and antioxidant defense, which is fostered by labile reactive iron. Therefore, in all the variable pathways that end up in ferroptosis, three prerequisites are in order: iron accumulation in the redox (reduction–oxidation) state, accumulation of lipid peroxidation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), and failure of lipid peroxide repair systems [15] (Fig. 1). To view how these three factors condemn the cell to death, we will first discuss lipid peroxide repair and iron physiological machinery.Fig. 1General theme of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death that disrupts the integrity of cell membranes. Lipid peroxidation is the executer of ferroptosis with three main prerequisites: high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and redox labile iron and compromised lipid peroxide repair systems. LOO●: lipid peroxides, LOOH●: lipid hydroperoxides",

LOO●: lipid peroxides, LOOH●: lipid hydroperoxides",
            "Ferroptosis renders cells a rather unique morphology, with mitochondrial size reduction, cell swelling, and plasma membrane thinning and rupture [16, 17]. This compromised cellular integrity at its core is executed by lipid peroxidation, which is fueled by redox-active iron and allowed to evolve in the absence of opposing lipid repair mechanisms [14, 15]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) stand as the chief villain behind the process of lipid peroxidation [18]. ROS generically describes oxygen-derived oxidants that are actively engaged in redox reactions. They encompass both oxygen radicals and oxidizing non-radicals. A radical atom or molecule harbors one or more unpaired electrons (●), such as superoxide anion (O2●), hydroxyl (OH●), peroxyl (RO2●), and hydroperoxyl (HO2●) radicals. On the other hand, non-radicals such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can easily generate highly reactive hydroxyl (OH●) radicals [19, 20]. H2O2 has poor reactivity to cellular biomolecules however, it can generate OH● radicals through interaction with transition metals such as ferrous iron (Fe+2), which is called the Fenton reaction [21, 22]. ROS are indispensable to cellular homeostasis, mediating various processes of cell signaling and enzymatic regulation. They are normally produced during cellular metabolism, essentially through the mitochondrial electron transport chain and enzymatically through the transmembrane nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (NOXs). Moreover, ROS can be generated by multiple other enzymes, including cytochrome P450, cyclooxygenases (COXs), and lipoxygenases (LOXs) [23]. However, once they surpass their physiological concentrations, ROS subject cells to oxidative stress and viciously interact with cellular proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acid, and lipids, resulting in DNA and protein damage and lipid peroxidation [24] (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Sources and fates of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a main cause behind lipid peroxidation. Superoxide anion (O2●) is a chief radical produced normally during cell metabolism through the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Its oxidative effect is diffused by SOD (superoxide dismutase) which transforms it into the non-radical hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 can also be enzymatically produced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (NOXs), cytochrome P450 (CYP450), cyclooxygenases (COXs), and lipoxygenases (LOXs). H202 then can share in cell signalling processes or get neutralized through catalase and GPX (glutathione peroxidases). However, H2O2 can cause DNA and protein damage and lipid peroxidation through generating the highly reactive hydroxyl (OH●) radical. H2O2 generates OH● radicals through the Fenton reaction by interaction with ferrous iron (Fe+2)",

            "Lipid peroxidation refers to lipid oxidative degradation as a result of the interaction of oxygen with unsaturated fatty acids and the formation of lipid peroxides (LOO●) and lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH●), which triggers a chain reaction of lipid radical formation [25]. Cell membranes are most vulnerable to lipid peroxidation due to their abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)-containing phospholipids (PL). PUFA have more than one double-bonded carbon in their hydrogen-carbon backbone and, therefore, several bis-allylic hydrogen atoms [26]. Bis-allylic hydrogen is the one attached to the carbon adjacent to two double-bonded/unsaturated carbon atoms. Bis-allylic hydrogen forms the weakest hydrogen-carbon bond, which makes its removal an easy task and renders PUFA more susceptible to radicals’ attacks [27, 28]. Lipid peroxidation, as a chain reaction of radicals’ formation, occurs in three steps: initiation, propagation, and termination. Lipid peroxidation is initiated by a radical attack such as OH● or HO2● radicals, which remove the bis-allylic hydrogen from the PUFA chain and generate a carbon-centered lipid radical or alkyl radical (PL-PUFA●). Once a lipid radical is formed, the reaction snowballs to a detrimental fate where PL-PUFA● interacts with molecular oxygen, forming a lipid peroxyl radical (PL-PUFAOO●). PL-PUFAOO● then abstracts a hydrogen from an adjacent PL, forming a lipid hydroperoxide radical (PL-PUFA-OOH●) and a new lipid radical, which helps propagate the chain reaction [29–32] (Fig. 3). Lipid peroxidation and PL-PUFA-OOH● formation can occur without or with an enzymatic intervention by cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, COXs, and LOXs enzymes [33]. LOXs can be considered an indirect manifestation of iron’s role in ferroptosis since their activity requires the oxidation of ferrous (Fe+2) to ferric (Fe+3) iron [34]. The involvement of either enzymatically or non-enzymatically formed PL-PUFA-OOH in ferroptosis is still a controversy [35, 36]. Iron can feed this malicious cycle, producing more lipid radicals through a Fenton-like reaction. The Fenton reaction is a series of redox reactions catalyzed by the labile Fe+2 pool. Fe+2 reacts with PL-PUFA-OOH●, gets oxidized to Fe+3, and forms a hydroxide anion and a highly reactive alkoxyl (PL-PUFA-O●) radical [37, 38]. During the propagation step, the sequential production of more lipid radicals incites exponentially growing damage. The chain reaction can continue, damaging the cell membrane lipid bilayer [39]. Along this process, highly toxic lipid peroxidation degradation products such as malonaldehyde (MDA) and 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) are formed and react with cell proteins and DNA, altering their structure and function and fostering a state of cytotoxicity [40–42]. Finally, the termination step can come about by quenching radicals by an anti-oxidant or reacting with another radical [31, 43] (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Mechanism of lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation occurs in three steps: 1-initiation, 2-propagation, and 3-termination. 1- Initiation: the vicious cycle of lipid peroxidation starts with a radical attack (X●) which reacts with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in cell membrane phospholipids (PL) and removes their bis-allylic hydrogen, transforming PUFA into a lipid/ alkyl radical (PL-PUFA●). 2- Propagation: Once a lipid radical is formed, a chain reaction of lipid radical formation continues. Molecular oxygen (O2) reacts with the formed PL-PUFA●, producing a lipid peroxyl radical (PL-PUFAOO●) which interacts with another membrane PL-PUFA, removes its bis-allylic hydrogen to form a lipid hydroperoxide radical (PL-PUFA-OOH●) and another PL-PUFA● that propagates the cycle. 2\\- Amplification: iron feeds this chain reaction through a Fenton-like reaction. Ferrous iron (Fe+2) reacts with PL-PUFA-OOH●, gets oxidized to Fe+3, and forms a hydroxide anion and a highly reactive alkoxyl (PL-PUFA-O●) radical that causes an exponential increase in lipid radical formation. 3- Termination: the cycle can be ended either by the presence of an antioxidant that turns radicals into non-radicals or by the interaction of two radicals, forming O2 and a non-radical",

            "Under normal conditions, cells can counterbalance these events through their antioxidant defense systems. Antioxidant cell defense works on the scavenging and removal of active oxidants [33] with multiple antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and peroxidases [28]. One of the most dedicated phospholipid repair systems is the glutathione (GSH)-glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) system. The GPX4 enzyme, or phospholipid hydroperoxide GPX (PHGPX), is an oxidoreductase that belongs to a family of eight GPXs [44]. GPX4 is a selenoprotein owing to its constituent selenocysteine, the 21st amino acid, which resembles cysteine (Cys) but differs by having a single atom of selenium instead of sulfur [45]. GPX4 can efficiently reduce hydroperoxides (OOH●) to their corresponding alcohols (-OH). GPX4 can execute the oxidation/reduction steps by shifting its selenocysteine active site between an oxidized and a reduced state. First, GPX4 reduces the toxic lipid peroxides to non-toxic lipid alcohols by oxidizing its active site, selenol (Se-H), to selenenic acid (Se-OH). At this point, the reducing GSH steps in to reduce the selenenic acid back to the active selenol, allowing the repeating of the oxidation/reduction process, and then it gets oxidized to glutathione disulfide (GS-SG) [46]. GSH is the most abundant cellular antioxidant. GSH is a tripeptidic thiol (sulfur containing), formed of cysteine, glutamate, and glycine. The glutamate and cysteine amide bond is catalyzed by glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), then glycine is added to the dipeptide to form GSH by glutathione synthase. The sulfur-containing cysteine renders GSH strong reducing and electron-donating properties, and is considered a rate-limiting substrate in the synthesis of GSH [47–49]. GSH alternates from its reduced form (GSH) to its oxidized glutathione disulfide form (GSSG), which turns back to GSH by glutathione reductase. Once GSH loses electrons to become oxidized, GSSG is formed by a disulfide bond between two GSH molecules [50, 51]. A critical component for the GSH/GPX4 system to fulfill its role is the Cystine/Glutamate antiporter or system Xc-. System Xc- is crucial for GSH availability [52]. It is formed of a 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc) or Solute carrier family 3 member 2 (SLC3A2) subunit and a light chain subunit called xCT, or Solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). System Xc- allows the transport of both cystine and glutamate in either direction. However, based on their concentration gradient and glutamate being shuttled intracellularly by its own transporter, the excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT), glutamate is exported and cystine is imported. Cystine, the oxidized form of cysteine, can then be reduced to cysteine by GSH or thioredoxin reductase 1 (TRR1) [53, 54] (Fig. 4). Another judging factor for the availability and biosynthesis of GSH is the Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NrF2) which is the major transcriptional factor that governs the expression of GSH and its related transporters among multiple anti-oxidant cellular responses [55, 56]. NrF2 promotes the expression of GCL, GR, and GPX4 and directly activates the SLC7A11 subunit of system Xc-. NrF2 is repressed by the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which is responsible for NrF2 regulation. In the case of oxidative stress, the redox-sensitive Keap1 is inactivated which allows the translocation of NrF2 into the nucleus to fulfill its role [57, 58].Fig. 4Glutathione (GSH)-glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) lipid peroxide repair system. GSH is a tripeptide formed of; cysteine, glutamate, and glycine. Cysteine is formed from cystine that enters the cell through a cystine/glutamate antiporter or Xc − system. The Xc- system is formed of a heavy chain subunit called Solute carrier family 3 member 2 (SLC3A2) and a light chain subunit called xCT, or Solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). The antiporter allows cystine into the cell in exchange of glutamate exiting the cell, with both moving down their concentration gradient. Once entered the cell, cystine is transformed into cysteine which binds to glutamate by the glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) forming a glutamylcysteine dipeptide. Glycine is added to the dipeptide to form GSH by glutathione synthase (GS). GPX4 interrupts lipid peroxidation by reducing lipid hydroperoxides (PL-PUFAOOH●) to their corresponding alcohols (PL-PUFAOH). To do so, the active site of GPX4, selenol (Se-H), gets oxidized to selenenic acid (Se-OH). To restore the reducing capacity of GPX4, GSH reduces the selenenic acid back to the active selenol and gets oxidized to glutathione disulfide (GSSG). To restore the reducing capacity of GSH, GSSG (the oxidized form) is turned into 2 GSH (the reduced form) by glutathione reductase (GR), using Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate Hydrogen (NADPH) as a reducing agent.

            "Iron is a peculiar metal that has a remarkable dichotomy of serving essential physiological processes for cell survival and, on the other hand, driving cells to their demise once tipped over its sensitive balance [59, 60]. Due to the toxic capacity of iron to overwhelm the antioxidant systems with ROS once free and overloaded, several proteins cater for iron, rendering most body iron protein bound. The portion of iron that is protein-unbound is referred to as labile iron, which possesses redox characteristics (the ability to undergo reduction-oxidation reactions). Also, it is the form of iron that is exchangeable and chelatable [61].",
            "The lack of a physiological mechanism for iron excretion adds another reason, besides its toxic propensity, to subject iron to strict regulation. The systemic iron pool builds up mainly from duodenal enterocytes absorbing iron, hepatocytes, and macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system recycling senescent erythrocytes, with ferroportin (FPN1) as the only way out to exit these cells. FPN1 is strictly controlled by hepcidin, a 25-amino acid peptide produced by the liver. Hepcidin expression, under physiological conditions, is upregulated by high serum iron. Hepcidin is considered the master hormonal regulator of iron since it controls the systemic availability of iron by limiting its intestinal absorption and blocking its cellular release through FPN1 degradation [62–65]. In the intestinal lumen, duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb), on the apical border of enterocytes, reduces Fe+3 to Fe+2, which is transported into the cytoplasm through the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) [66]. Fe+2 can then exit the basolateral border of enterocytes into the circulation through FPN1. Exported Fe+2 is oxidized by hephaestin or ceruloplasmin to form Fe+3 [67]. Fe+3 is transported within the circulation bound to liver-synthesized transferrin that allows iron entry into cells through transferrin receptors (TfR1). The TfR1-transferrin complex is then taken up into the cell by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In the endosome, the ferrireductase activity of the six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 3 (STEAP3) reduces Fe+3 to Fe+2 [68]. Fe+2 is released from the endosome into the cytoplasm through DMT1 and the transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1). In addition, DMT1 on cell membranes can allow the passage of non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) [69]. Iron can then be utilized, exported, or stored in the form of ferritin. Apoferritin is an iron storage shell formed of 24 subunits of two types: Heavy (H ferritin) and Light (L ferritin). Iron loading into apoferritin is mediated by H ferritin, which has ferroxidase enzymatic activity to oxidize Fe+2 to Fe+3 [63, 70]. On the other hand, iron mobilization from ferritin is facilitated by ferritinophagy. Ferritinophagy is an autophagic degradation of ferritin mediated by nuclear receptor co-activator 4 (NCOA4), increasing iron cellular availability [71, 72]. In cases of excess labile catalytic iron pool and over-activated ferritinophagy, H ferritin steps in to load iron into ferritin to prevent triggering ferroptosis [73, 74]. Serum ferritin, secreted from hepatocytes, reticuloendothelial cells, and other parenchymal cells, has always been an indicator for body iron stores since it correlates with intracellular iron concentration in physiological settings and in cases of iron overload [75–77].",
            "With iron being utilized or stored in the form of ferritin, the free iron existing in the labile iron pool, the redox active iron, remains a concern that needs regulation, especially with the previously mentioned role of iron in promoting lipid peroxidation [61, 78]. To guarantee tight regulation, molecular machinery for the regulation of iron transporters exists in the form of the iron responsive element/iron regulatory protein (IRE/IRP) system. IRP1 and IRP2 are cytosolic proteins that bind to IRE in the mRNA of different target genes and control their translation, including TfR1, DMT1, ferritin, and FPN1 [79]. Once the IRPs are activated, they promote the expression of TfR1 and DMT1 and inhibit that of FPN1 and ferritin, which favors the increment of the labile iron pool and a potential unfavorable outcome [80, 81] (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Iron physiological machinery. The availability of iron in the systemic circulation depends on its absorption from the duodenum, release of iron from old red blood cells (RBCs) engulfed by macrophages, and release of iron from its liver stores, stored as ferritin. Ferritin is an iron storage shell formed of 2 type subunits: Heavy (H ferritin) and Light (L ferritin). H ferritin has a ferroxidase enzymatic activity to oxidize ferrous (Fe+2) to ferric iron (Fe+3) and load it into the shell. In the duodenum, duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb), on the apical border of enterocytes, reduces Fe+3 to Fe+2 to enter the cell through the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). Fe+2 then exit enterocytes through ferroportin 1 (FPN1). FPN1 is under the control of hepcidin, the only hormonal regulation of iron. Exported Fe+2 is oxidized by hephaestin or ceruloplasmin to form Fe+3. Within the circulation, Fe+3 binds to apotransferrin, forming transferrin. Iron then gets distributed to body systems and each cell forms its share of labile iron pool (LIP). The LIP can be formed from three routes. First, the release of iron from its stores in ferritin by the process of ferritinophagy mediated by nuclear receptor co-activator 4 (NCOA4). Second, imported into the cell as non-transferrin-bound (NTB) iron through DMT1. Third, imported into the cell as transferrin which binds to transferrin receptors-1 (TfR1).

            "Ferroptosis can be described as a state of “loss of control” of both lipid repair systems and iron in the presence of inflated lipid peroxidation. Lipids comprise around 50% of the brain's dry weight [82], which makes the brain an easy target [83]. Since lipid peroxidation is considered the core event in ferroptosis, the higher the content of PUFA, the more sensitive cells are to ferroptosis [84]. In a study in germ cells, the dietary ingestion of the PUFA dihomo-γ-linolenic acid induced ferroptosis [85]. Moreover, the administration of arachidonic acid, an omega-6 PUFA, combined with interferon gamma (IFN‐γ), mediated ferroptosis in tumor cells in an acyl-coenzyme A synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4)-dependent manner [86]. ACSL4 is a crucial enzyme for incorporating PUFA into PL by binding them to coenzyme A to produce PUFA-CoAs [87]. Therefore, ACSL4 can induce ferroptosis by changing the landscape of existing lipids with a more robust content of PUFA-containing PL [88]. What can also induce ferroptosis through changing the lipid landscape, in terms of higher lipid peroxide formation, are NOXs and LOXs enzymes [36] (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Ferroptosis molecular machinery. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death which is executed by lipid peroxidation. The loss of iron regulation and functioning lipid peroxide repair systems foster lipid radical production and lipid peroxidation. 1- Iron dysregulation: During ferroptosis, there is an increase in the labile iron pool (LIP), which is the redox active iron. Within cells, the LIP increases through importing more iron through the upregulated divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and transferrin receptors-1 (TFR1), limiting iron exportation by degrading FPN1, and releasing iron from its ferritin stores by the nuclear receptor co-activator 4 (NCOA4)- mediated ferritinophagy or ferritin degradation. At a molecular level, iron regulatory proteins (IRP1/2) are upregulated and bind to the iron responsive element (IRE) in the mRNA of iron-related proteins, increasing the the expression of TfR1 and DMT1 and inhibiting that of FPN1 and ferritin, which favors the build-up of LIP. 2-Loss of antioxidant defense: Through a Fenton-like reaction, ferrous iron (Fe+2), in the expanding LIP, acts on hydrogen peroxides (H2O2) to form highly reactive hydroxyl (OH●) radicals. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overwhelms the already-inflicted antioxidant defence system. During ferroptosis, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NrF2) decrease and P53 increase can downregulate of the Solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), which denies the entry of cystine and therefore decrease the formation of glutathione (GSH). 3- Lipid peroxidation: During ferroptosis, an increase in acyl-coenzyme A synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) incorporates more polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into membrane phospholipid by binding them to coenzyme A to produce PUFA-CoAs. The abundance of ROS initiates a chain reaction of lipid peroxidation forming lipid hydroperoxides (PUFAOOH●). The chain reaction is amplified by the grown LIP and lipoxygenases (LOX) that help the enzymatic formation of PUFAOOH●. With the decreased availability of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and GSH. The chain reaction of lipid peroxidation propagates extensively, inciting more and more ferroptosis",

            "Failure of lipid peroxidation defenses takes up a noticeable role in ferroptosis induction. The inactivation or deletion of GPX4, as an essential lipid peroxidation opponent, is extensively reported and reviewed as a competent tactic for ferroptosis induction in various cell types [89–91]. In addition, GSH depletion is another way to halt the GPX4/GSH protective effect against ferroptosis. GSH depletion can be a consequence of the inactivation of SLC7A11 of system Xc- which impairs the importing of cystine and hence the available cysteine needed for GSH synthesis [15]. The expression of SLC7A11 is regulated by multiple transcriptional factors, such as tumor protein p53 (p53) [92] and NrF2 [58]. P53 is a tumor suppressor that is activated during cellular stress and can induce cell cycle arrest and senescence. P53 suppresses SLC7A11 expression and enables the induction of ferroptosis [92]. On the other hand, the anti-oxidant transcriptional factor NrF2 can redeem the expression of SLC7A11 and therefore form an opposing force against ferroptosis [93].",
            "During ferroptosis, the tight regulation of iron falls into complete chaos, which amplifies the labile iron pool and its threatening redox activity. The upregulation of TfR1 feeds the labile iron pool with more iron uptake; therefore, TfR1 high expression is a prominent feature of ferroptosis [94, 95]. Another way to feed the labile iron pool is through the overexpression of DMT1, which also works as a ferroptosis mediator [96, 97]. The same fate is fulfilled with the upregulation of IRPs [98, 99], the downregulation of FPN1 [100, 101], and the increased production of hepcidin, trapping more iron within cells [102]. The autophagic degradation of ferritin, NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy, disrupts the ratio of ferritin-stored iron to free redox-active iron in favor of the latter [103]. The reduction of NrF2 was found to aggravate NCOA4 ferritinophagy [104]. Moreover, NrF2 helps up-regulate H ferritin expression and, hence, iron loading into ferritin, shielding cells from ferroptosis [105] (Fig. 6). Besides ferritinophagy, another autophagic degradation of the clock gene transcriptional factors, termed clockophagy, can also mediate ferroptosis [106].",
            "The inquiry of whether COVID-19 impacts the brain to the point of accelerating the physiological aging process stems from various intriguing findings. Aging was repeatedly reported as an imperative risk factor for a deteriorated course of COVID-19 infection [107, 108]. Senescent cells, positive for the cell cycle inhibitor p16, were more prevalent in the postmortem frontal cortex of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to their age-matched controls. Senolytic drugs such as dasatinib and quercetin have shown an improved SARS-CoV-2 clinical course and survival in angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors- overexpressing mice and in patients [109, 110]. Tripathi et al. also found senescence in human non-senescent cells and exaggeration of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-related inflammatory molecules in human senescent cells with the application of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [111]. Similar findings were reported by Meyer et al. where they found enhanced expression of senescence-related markers, p16, p21, and β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal), in spike-transfected human epithelial cells with increased release of SASP, which was reversed by inhibiting interleukin (IL)-6 signaling [112]. The argument about COVID-19-associated aging could be further validated by the depicted telomere shortening and DNA methylation in a cohort of 407 COVID-19 patients during the initial phase of the disease [113].",
            "The emergence and acceleration of neurodegenerative disorders post-COVID-19 infection is a recurring observation. Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) reported the occurrence or exacerbation of both motor and non-motor symptoms such as mood changes, sleep disorders, and cognitive impairment [114, 115]. Another alarming observation is the higher mortality rates of PD patients post-COVID-19 compared to the pre-COVID-19 rates, with PD shown as a risk factor for COVID-19-associated mortality [116, 117]. Also, patients with PD displayed a higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared to their matched controls [118]. A similar scenario unfolds in the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where a higher risk of new-onset AD in COVID-19-infected patients is reported compared to their matched controls [119]. AD patients are also more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with AD being a risk factor for a poor prognosis of COVID-19 infection [120]. Deterioration of neuropsychiatric manifestations and cognitive decline in AD patients has been a frequent observation during the COVID-19 pandemic [121]. Frontera et al. interestingly, reported higher neurodegenerative markers (neurofilament light chain (NfL), ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)) in COVID-19 patients when compared to non-COVID controls with AD or with mild cognitive impairment [122], implying a deteriorated prognosis for neurodegenerative disorders with COVID-19 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binds to several proteins, such as amyloid β (Aβ) and tau, accelerating their brain aggregation [123]. One year post-COVID-19, Ferrucci et al. detected brain hypometabolism and Aβ deposition in a positron emission tomography (PET) scan of one patient out of 7 patients with cognitive impairment [124], which mandates further investigation.",
            "Aligning with the plausible development of accelerated aging or neurodegenerative disorder, cognitive impairment is highly prevalent among patients with post-COVID syndrome [8, 10]. Several studies assessed alterations in specific cognitive domains (i.e., executive functions, speed of processing, memory, attention, and language) [reviewed in [11–13] with attention deficits as the most common affected domain [125–130]. Liu et al. reported significant cognitive impairment in hospitalized COVID-19 older adults (n = 1,539) compared to a healthy control group (n = 466) six months after hospital discharge [131]. Matias-Guiu et al. utilized unsupervised machine-learning clustering algorithms to cluster cognitive domains impaired in a cohort of patients with post-COVID syndrome (n = 404) in comparison to healthy controls (N = 145) and reported that as many as 41.2% of the sample were classified as having at least one cognitive domain impaired, mostly attention and processing speed [125]. Another study reported that 85% of patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome (n = 214) had some alterations in at least one cognitive domain, with attention and executive functions being the most frequently affected areas [126]. Similar results were reported by Garcia-Sanchez et al., who also identified deficits in the attention domain as the most prominent cognitive impairment (with and without associated executive deficits) in a sample of post-COVID-19 patients with subjective cognitive complaints (n = 63) [127]. Delgado-Alonso et al. reported attention deficits associated with poor performance in executive function, working, and episodic memory, as well as visuospatial processing, in a group of post-COVID-19 patients (n = 50) with subjective cognitive complaints [132]. Unfortunately, cognitive impairment has been documented in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 individuals [130], non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients [128], and severe, critically ill patients [133], with evidence that COVID-19 patients with severe illness have worse cognition compared to non-severe patients and to healthy controls [131, 133]. The menacing yet enigmatic nature of these observations demands robust research efforts dedicated to investigating the underlying mechanisms and providing satisfactory solutions. Therefore, we present ferroptosis as a mechanism behind the post-COVID trajectory of aging and neurodegeneration and melatonin as a well-fitted answer. We first discuss the physiological background of melatonin and how it could be the answer as an anti-ferroptosis.",
            "More than half a century ago, melatonin was identified as the chief hormone of the pineal gland. The name came from its observed capacity to lighten fish and frogs, skin color by shielding melanocytes from the darkening effect of the melanocyt-stimulating hormone and gathering melanin granules [134, 135]. Therefore, the name came about as melanophore-contracting hormone from the Greek; melas meaning \"dark\" and “tonos” meaning to suppress [136]. Ironically, later, meltonin became popular as the “darkness hormone” [137] when its versatile biological effects started to unfold and it was recognized as the main regulator of the body’s circadian dark/light cycle [138–141].",
            "Melatonin gained its latter nickname since its synthesis and release are stimulated by darkness and diminished by light. The pineal gland acts as a neuroendocrine transducer since it manages its melatonin production based on the dark/light signal it receives from the “central biological clock”, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus [142, 143]. The SCN receives light information through the retinal-hypothalamic tract from retinal ganglionic cells [144]. Then, it sends its neural signal to the pineal gland through adrenergic sympathetic fibers after synapsing in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) [145]. Noreadrenaline activates the pinealocyte ß adrenergic receptors, increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA) and α1- adrenergic receptors, increasing intracellular Ca+2 and protein kinase C (PKC), which promotes the transcription of melatonin-forming enzymes [146]. Pinealocytes use tryptophan as a precursor to form serotonin, passing by hydoxy-tryptopan. Serotonin is then converted into N-acetylserotonin and finally into melatonin by the enzymes Serotonin-N-acetyl transferase (SNAT) and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT), respectively [142, 143, 147]. Therefore, melatonin’s synthesis can be jeopardized by tryptophan depletion [148], especially since the pineal gland is not protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), so severe flactuations of plasma tryptophan levels could affect melatonin concentration [149]. Moreover, the availability of synaptic catecholamine by mono-amine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors can potentiate melatonin’s production [150]. Despite the pineal gland being the main source for melatonin, extra pineal sources share in its synthesis, such as the retina, GIT mucosa, kidney, adrenals, thyroid, pancreas, and platelets, and other brain regions including the hypothalamus, pons, medulla, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex [151]. Upon exerting its action, melatonin in the brain could be catabolized into kynurenine mtabolites, which represent the other pathway for tryptophan metabolism besides serotonin [149] (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Melatonin’s synthesis and release. Melatonin is a dark hormone where its synthesis and release from the pineal gland depend on the the the dark/light signal it receives from the “central biological clock”, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. The SCN receives light information through the retinal-hypothalamic tract from retinal ganglionic cells and then sends adrenergic sympathetic fibers to the pineal gland after synapsing in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and the superior cervical ganglia (SCG). The post-ganglionic sympathetic fibers releases noreadrenaline (NE), which activates the pinealocyte ß and α1 adrenergic receptors. The activation of ß receptors activates adenyl cyclase (AC), which increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA). The activation of α1-adrenergic receptors activates phospholipase C (PLC) which acts on Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to form 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and increases intracellular Ca+2 and protein kinase C (PKC). The expression of PKA and PKC promotes the transcription of melatonin-forming enzymes. Melatonin is formed in pinealocytes from tryptophan. Tryptophan is turned into hydroxy-tryptophan (5-HTP) by tryptophan hydroxylase. 5-HTP is turned into serotonin (5-HT) by decarboxylase. 5-HT is converted into N-acetylserotonin by Serotonin-N-acetyl transferase (SNAT). Finally, N-acetylserotonin is converted into melatonin by hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT)",

            "Melatonin can exert its plethora of functions in a receptor-mediated or non-receptor-mediated manner [152]. Owing to its lipophilic properties [153], melatonin can interact with membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear receptors [154]. Melatonin binds to two membrane-related G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) called MT1 and MT2 [155, 156]. GPCRs are a large family of receptors characterized by binding to guanosine di/triphosphate (GDP/GTP), hence the name. GPCRs are formed of three subunits: alpha, beta, and gamma, and based on the type of the alpha, G proteins could be Gi (inhibitory), Gs (stimulatory), Gq, or G12 [157]. MT1 and MT2 are mainly Gi coupled; therefore, melatonin’s binding inhibits adenyle cyclase and the cAMP/PKA/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway or the guanylate cyclase (GC)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)/protein kinase G (PKG) pathway, respectively. However, melatonin’s receptors can be Gq-coupled and activate phospholipase C (PLC), which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), producing inositol triphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), which increases Ca+2levels and activates calmodulin (CaM) and CaM kinase signaling [158, 159]. A third binding site for melatonin is MT3, which is the cytosolic enzyme quinone reductase 2 (QR2) [160]. QR2 is one of the reductases that help protect against oxidative stress by blunting quinones’ electron transfer reactions [161].In addition, melatonin binds to a family of nuclear receptors called the retinoid-related orphan (ROR) receptors [162], which are involved in the regulation and modulation of the circadian clock [163]. Melatonin can directly detoxify free radicals in a non-receptor-mediated fashion, either directly or through its metabolites [152] (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Melatonin’s receptors and mechanism of action. Melatonin can exert its various actions on cells through receptor-mediated and non-receptor mediated actions. Melatonin receptors are dispersed in the cytoplasm as MT3 receptors which are the cytosolic enzyme quinone reductase 2 (QR2), in the nucleus as the retinoid-related orphan (ROR) receptors, and on the cell membrane. On the cell membrane, melatonin acts through membrane-related G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) called MT1 and MT2. When melatonin binds to the Gi coupled receptors, the alpha subunit seperates from the beta and gamma subunits, with the conversion of the attached guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to guanosine triphosphate (GTP). This inhibits adenyle cyclase (AC) and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway. Also, the binding of melatonin to the Gi coupled receptors can inhibit the guanylate cyclase (GC)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)/protein kinase G (PKG) pathway. The activation of the Gq-coupled receptors activates phospholipase C (PLC), which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), which increases Ca+2levels and activates calmodulin (CaM) and CaM kinase signaling",

            "Since being identified, melatonin’s physiological roles have witnessed multiple transitions from being known for its skin-lightening effects [134]. The anticipated dermatological role was swiftly redirected to its gonadal effects [164, 165]. The light/dark-dependent gonadal inhibitory effect of melatonin [166–168] was the spark that shined upon its unmatched physiological role as a chronobiotic hormone [169]. The fact that melatonin is a night signal shapes its entire mission of circadian rhythm regulation, especially sleep-wake rhythms and core temperature [170], along with its anti-oxidant [171], immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory [172], and glucose regulation effects [173].",
            "Melatonin’s production peaks at the dark phase of the day and is suppressed by light [174], with evidence of being effectively suppressed by short-wavelength blue light [175]. The secretion of melatonin represents the biological night; hence, it transduces the dark signal to the body and, as such, adjusts the timing of the central biological clock, SCN, and circadian rhythms of the body [176]. The capacity of melatonin to manipulate the body’s circadian rhythms was first witnessed on exogenous administration of 2 mg of melatonin, which advanced sleep time [177]. The circadian rhythm in the body is governed by the central clock, SCN, and an associated molecular machinery within body cells, namely the clock genes. Interestingly, melatonin is not only the handyman for the SCN, transmitting its neural signal to peripheral tissues that express melatonin receptors, but it can also feedback and manipulate both the central clock (i.e., the SCN) and the clock genes [145, 178–180]. The circadian rhythm molecular machinery depends on two major transcriptional factors: BMAL1/ARNTL (brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 or aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1) and CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput). CLOCK and BMAL1 heterodimerize and activate the transcription of circadian-controlled clock genes, including three Period (Per1, Per2, Per3) and two Cryptocrome (Cry 1, Cry 2) genes. After their translation, Per and Cry translocate to the nucleus and create a negative feedback loop, inhibiting both CLOCK and BMAL1 [181, 182]. Another route through which CLOCK and BMAL1 can function is by promoting the transcription of the nuclear receptors REV-ERBα [also known as NR1D1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1)] and ROR, which is one of melatonin’s target receptors. Then, REV-ERBα and ROR form their own negative and positive feedback loop, respectively, on BMAL1 transcription [183, 184]. Melatonin evidently participates in the well-functioning of the circadian molecular machinery, and their interaction is considered one of melatonin’s substantial effects on cell survival [185].",
            "Melatonin’s versatile actions span all body systems in a cytoprotective manner. On reproduction, melatonin decreases gonadotropin release hormone (GnRH) production [186], regulating the release of prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) [187] and therefore the onset of puberty [188]. In addition, melatonin regulates ovulation, folliculogenesis, and spermatogenesis, among many other aspects of male and female reproduction [189–191]. On the skeletal system, melatonin protects bone density, promotes osteogenesis, and facilitates the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into bone-forming osteoblasts [192, 193]. On the cardiovascular system, melatonin regulates blood pressure circadian rhythms, exhibits an antagonistic action to angiotensin II (Ag II) [194, 195], and diminishes the flactuation of cerebral blood flow [196]. On the GIT, melatonin exerts diverse actions, including protecting the intestinal mucosa, relaxing the GIT smooth muscles, adjusting digestive enzymes, and modulating gut microbiome [197].",
            "The CNS is specifically endowed with widely disrtributed melatonin receptors with the advantage of melatonin being directly secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [198]. Being available in the CSF makes melatonin’s function on neurons and glial cells more accessible, especially with their extensive expression of melatonin’s receptors [198–200]. Melatonin is an indispensible neuroprotective substance with a plethora of functions, including effects on cognition, neurotransmission, hippocampal neurogenesis, and regulation of synaptic and neural plasticity, along with its chief role as a chronobiotic [201]. Melatonin has a unique depressive effect on brain excitability. This was repeatedly demonstrated in reports of increased brain electrical activity after pinealectomy [202, 203] and diminished activation of seizures in rats receiving several epileptogenic agents upon systemic melatonin administration [204]. The uniqueness of melatonin’s action in this regard stems from its ability to modulate the two major neurotransmitters governing brain excitability. Melatonin shows a gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-like action, potentiates its activity on neurons [205], enhances its levels [206], and exhibits a modulating action on benzodiazepine receptors [207–209]. On the other hand, melatonin diminishes the infamous glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. Glutamate action on N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, one of its ionotropic receptors, incites Ca+2 influx and Ca+2-calmodulin-dependent activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) which then produces Nitric oxide (NO), the signal that sustains glutamate release [210]. Melatonin can disrupt this potentially malicious cycle by binding to calmodulin, inhibiting the activation of NOS and the synthesis of NO [211–214]. To further validate the argument of melatonin’s comprehensive action on the brain, Larson et al. showed impaired long-term potentiation, the process behind long-term memory, in MT2 receptors-deficient mice, denoting an extended role of melatonin in memory processing [215]. Bechstein et al. detected worsened spatial learning in melatonin receptor-knockout (KO) mice compared to the wild type (WT). They displayed enhancement of the working memory with melatonin adminstration to melatonin-deficient C57BL/6 mice on daytime. In addition, WT mice showed an evident difference in day/night LTP, which was absent in melatonin and melatonin receptor-deficient mice, highlighting the circadian regulatory effect of melatonin on LTP [216].",
            "Melatonin is involved in an extensively wide arena of pathological contexts that can be explained by its multi-system action and overarching physiological properties and implications [217]. Moreover, the continuously expanding research on melatonin’s role in humans’ pathology can be partially attributed to its repeatedly-reported safety as a potential treatment [218]. Three double-blind controlled studies showed the lack of serious adverse effects of melatonin with exogenous long-term use, for more than six months. Only a few reports showed significant somnolence and mood swings, which validates the absence of concerning issues and the reasonable tolerability of melatonin use [219]. Nonetheless, the use of melatonin needs cautionary measures when used with other medications, especially anticoagulants such as warfarin, since their interaction could increase the risk of bleeding [220–222] To show the variability of its pathological involvement, melatonin is implicated in sleep disorders [223, 224], precocious puberty [225], polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis [226], coronary heart diseases [227], GIT disorders [228], cancer [229], diabetes [230], obesity and energy metabolism issues [231], and a wide array of psychiatric and neurological disorders [232]. The proposed therapeutic efficacy of melatonin for the post-COVID-19 trajectory of brain aging and neurodegeneration is based upon melatonin’s long history with aging, neurodegenerative disorders, viruses, and most recently, SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "Aging has been repeatedly claimed to be a secondary event to pineal malfunction, with an apparent loss of melatonin’s day-night rhythm and a drop in the magnitude of its nighttime production [233–236]. Melatonin has anti-aging properties and is extensively reported to combat age-related disorders on both experimental and clinical levels. Twenty-two-months-old rats fed with melatonin for ten weeks showed better bone structure and diminished age-related bone loss [237]. An interesting study found a 42% prolonged life span in old mice when subjected to pineal gland transplantation from young ones and a 29% reduction in life span with pineal transplantation from the old to the young ones [238]. In addition, melatonin improved immune functions in aged immune-compromised mice [239]. In a d-galactose-induced aging model, melatonin enhanced the associated spatial memory defects and regained neuronal proliferation [240]. In senescence-accelerated prone mice (SAMP8), melatonin exhibited improvement in hippocampal neurogenesis [241]. Melatonin favors anti-aging outcomes through its anti-inflammatory properties, suppressing the process of inflammaging [242]. In addition to its myriad of beneficial qualities, melatonin showed an anti-oxidant effect in the hippocampus of aged rats [243]. In a randomized controlled study, melatonin improved sleep quality and morning alertness in aging patients with primary insomnia [244]. Melatonin improved post-operative cognitive decline, fatigue, and general well-being in elderly patients with hip arthroplasty [245]. A retrospective study on patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 25) on 9-18 months of melatonin (3-9 mg) showed better performance in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale, and multiple neuropsychological tests [246].",
            "Being referred to as age-related disorders, multiple studies on neurodegenerative disorders displayed a positive outcome with melatonin. Melatonin showed a recurrent theme of improvement of cognitive deficits, memory performance, and associated anxiety and depression in various mouse models of AD [247–249]. Melatonin projected the same positive image in experimental models of PD, improving neurobehavioral tasks and neural deficits in a cytoprotective manner [250–252]. In addition, in experimental models, melatonin ameliorated the severity of multiple sclerosis (MS) [253] and improved survival time in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [254]. Luckily, these results are, to some extent, mirrored in clinical studies. A meta-analysis of 50 randomized controlled trials in AD patients concluded a better score on the MMSE ( the medium-term low-dose melatonin to be associated with the highest post-treatment MMSE (mean difference = 1.48, 95% CI 0.51-2.46), assessing cognitive functions, with medium-term low-dose melatonin [255]. Low melatonin levels have been linked to cognitive decline [256] and trough, but not daytime [257]. Melatonin levels were associated with cognitive dysfunction as measured by MMSE in patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s dementia [258]. Obayashi et al. reported that higher melatonin metabolite concentrations (urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin: UME) are associated with significantly lower cognitive performance in the MMSE (n = 935) and in the Geriatric Depression Scale (n = 1,097) [259]. In a randomized controlled clinical trial in 60 PD patients, 12 weeks of melatonin administration (10 mg/d) improved cognition, anxiety, and depression compared to patients on placebo [260]. A pilot study of fourteen patients with MS on 6 mg of melatonin at bedtime exhibited better physical and cognitive tasks, including posturographic tests, Montreal cognitive assessment, and simple reaction time test. They also reported better sleep quality on the Spiegel’s sleep questionnaire [261]. A retrospective analysis of the Pooled Resource Open-Access Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) database demonstrated a declining death rate in melatonin users compared to non-users among ALS patients (95% CI 0.088–0.659, P = 0.0056). Interestingly, melatonin users also had a slower decline in the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) (t = 2.71, P = 0.0069), which assesses patients’ physical functions and daily activity [262].",
            "As broadly implicated in aging and neurodegenerative disorders, melatonin has its own relevance in viral infections, portraying its magnificent versatility. The encompassing anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic, and immune modulatory effects of melatonin enable it to easily behave as an efficient anti-viral [263]. Melatonin came to the rescue in previous viral outbreaks, such as the Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) infection in 1995 [264], West Nile encephalitis in 2002 [265], the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [266], and the Ebola virus in 2013 [267]. The highlights of melatonin’s anti-viral action are that it reduces viremia, viral load in the brain, encephalitis, acute lung injury, and mortality rates [263].",
            "Once again, with the COVID-19 pandemic, heads turned towards melatonin and its therapeutic potential, especially with its deficient levels in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Yilmaz and Oner found lower plasma melatonin levels in COVID-19-positive pneumonia patients compared to healthy controls at 23:00 h and compared to the COVID-19-negative pneumonia group and healthy controls at 02:00 h and 06:00 h. Interestingly, they reported a negative correlation between the plasma level of melatonin and scores of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Templer Death Anxiety Scale (TDAS), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients [268]. Their findings imply a potential role of melatonin deficiency in COVID-19-associated depression, anxiety, and insomnia, which encourages further research to deploy melatonin in COVID-19 patients with such complications. Melatonin deficiency in COVID-19 can arise from the faulty absorption of dietary tryptophan because SARS-CoV-2 downregulates angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, the chaperone of the tryptophan transporter [269]. Several attempts have been made to investigate the impact of melaotonin on the COVID-19 infection course. In a study of 44 COVID-19 cases, Farnoosh et al. reported decreased pulmonary involvement, fatigue, CRP levels, time to discharge, and a more prompt return to baseline health in patients receiving melatonin at a dose of 3 mg three times daily for 14 days [270]. Another pilot study by Fogleman et al. reached a similar outcome in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms receiving melatonin 10 mg/d for 14 days, showing quicker symptoms resolution [271]. A larger randomized controlled trial with 118 ICU-admitted severe COVID-19 cases used 5 mg of melatonin twice daily for 7 days. Interestingly, they depicted a significant improvement in the mortality rate, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, the hospital and ICU length of stay, and the duration until clinical improvement in the melatonin group. Also, they found a significant improvement in CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), procalcitonine, D-dimer, and serum ferritin levels during the duration of the intervention with melatonin [272]. Besides the improved hospital course, melatonin ameliorated the frequency of some of the COVID-19 ruthless complications. Hasan et al. monitored the occurrence of sepsis and thrombosis among 158 severe COVID-19 patients, of whom 82 received 10 mg/d melatonin for 14 days along with standard therapy. Patients on melatonin were less likely to develop thrombosis and sepsis and had a lower mortality rate [273]. Nevertheless, some reports renounced melatonin’s potential for a better COVID-19 course and outcome. In a pilot randomized trial of 21 severe COVID-19 cases, Darban et al. reported no difference in the oxygen saturation, inflammatory markers, or ICU length of stay between patients on melatonin, zinc, and vitamin C added to the standard treatment and those on standard care only [274]. Similarly, in a retrospective observational study, Sánchez-Rico et al. demonstrated no impact of melatonin on the mortality rate among hospitalized COVID-19 patients [275]. Sahu et al., another retrospective study, viewed the impact of melatonin at the opposite end of the spectrum, showing a longer length of hospital stay among patients on 6 and 9 mg/d of melatonin and an absent positive impact on mortality rates [276]. A better approach to resolving the discrepancy of melatonin’s effect would by performing well-designed controlled studies with larger sample sizes [277]. Despite the contradictory clinical reports, animal studies support melatonin’s positive impact. In a K18-hACE2 mouse model of COVID-19, 2 days of melatonin pre-infection and 7 days post-infection with SARS-CoV2 minimized the brain viral load, small vessel damage, and brain inflammation [278]. Additionally, Yadalam et al. demonstrated, in an in silico study, a significant intermolecular interaction of melatonin and its receptor agonists, agomelatine and ramelteon, with the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the ACE2 receptors which makes the notion of melatonin hindering the SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry more credible [279]. In the same light, using melatonin and its receptor agonists before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 mice brought about better survival rates and higher clinical scores. However, there were no changes in the plasma cytokine panel or lung inflammatory markers except for higher expression of type I and type III interferon (IFN) in the lungs with melatonin treatment [280]. Despite the undeniable data on how useful melatonin could be during the course of COVID-19 infection, the use of melatonin against post-COVID sequelae is still an unexplored territory on both clinical and experimental levels. What can boost melatonin’s chances is its history against multiple viral infections as a free radical scavenger, an anti-inflammatory, and an anti-apoptotic molecule [263], as well as the intriguing intersection it has with the potential post-COVID-19 pathogenesis and ferroptosis.",
            "To view melatonin’s potential anti-ferroptosis effect, we need to first display how COVID-19 and its trajectory intersect with ferroptosis. We propose an intricate intersection between five major events that will ease the way for ferroptosis to occur, including neuroinflammation, iron dysregulation, GPX4/GSH/SLC7A11, antioxidant defenses, repression, ACE2 receptors-degradation-dependent events, and finally clock genes disruption (Fig. 9).Fig. 9Ferroptosis as a hyothetical mechanism for the post-COVID-19 trajectory of aging and neurodegeneration. In COVID-19, five shared events can prelude to ferroptosis in post-COVID-19 trajectory. They are 1-Neuroinflammation, 2-Iron dysregulation, 3-Reactive oxygen species (ROS)/antioxidant imbalance, 4- ACE2/Ag II disruption, and 5-Clock gene alteration. 1- The SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm disrupts BBB, which allows pro-inflammatory cytokines to pass to the brain vicinity and activate microglia. Pro-inflammatory ctokines aid the microglia polarization from M2 (anti-inflammatory) to M1 (Pro-inflammatory). 2- IL-6 promotes the production of hepcidin from microglia and astrocytes. Hepcidin degrades FPN1, which traps iron in neurons, microglia, and propably astrocytes. In iron-overloaded microglia, higher LIP causes more microglia polarization and NF-κB helps production of more pro-inflammatory cytokines and activates the iNOS which increases the production of NO. NO passes to neurons and modulates the molecular machinery of iron regulation by upregulating IRP, which causes higher expression of DMT1 and TFR1 and lower expression of ferritin and FPN1. This disruption in iron-related proteins increases the LIP and incites a vicious cycle of iron dysregulation and neuroinflammation. 3- The higher expression of NF-κB decreases the expression of NrF2. The iron overload activates P53. The less NrF2 and more P53 repress the expression of SLC7A11, which decreases the production of GSH. The less NrF2 also can decrease the production of GPX4, compromising the antioxidant system in the face of higher H2O2 and OH● production caused by NOX and high LIP, respectively. 4- The binding of the spike protein to ACE2 receptors degrades them and Ag II accumulates and binds to ATR1, activating NOX and producing more H2O2. 5- SARS-CoV-2 could induce autophagic degradation/clockophagy of BMAL1 and CLOCK, which is mediated by the cargo receptor SQSTM1/p62. The high LIP, the disruption of ACE2/ATR1, the antioxidant system failure, and BMAL1-CLOCK deficiency all would promote lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in a progressive manner that would lead to acceleration of aging and neurodegeneration.

            "In COVID-19 patients, altered iron metabolism, depletion of GSH [281], inactivation of GPX4 [282], and up-regulation of lipid peroxidation biomarkers strongly propose ferroptosis as a plausible mechanism for COVID-19 multi-organ affection, including neuropsychiatric sequelae [283]. In an ischemic stroke model, ACSL4 promoted ferroptosis-induced brain injury and neuroinflammation with similar findings to neuro-COVID-19 events, such as infarct size increase, reduced neurological function, microglial activation, and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-6, and IL-1β) [284]. In the context of COVID 19, we can see strong indicators of iron perturbation along with neuroinflammation in several forms. High serum ferritin [285] and hepcidin levels [286], low serum iron levels [287], and low transferrin saturation [288] have been significantly correlated with COVID-19 severity, hospitalization, and mortality [289–291].",
            "The cytokine storm is a prominent feature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, instigating systemic flooding with pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, IFN-γ, and TNF-α [292, 293]. Moreover, the cytokine storm co-exists with a massive increase in coagulopathies and acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum ferritin, which correlate with the severity of the disease [294–296]. High levels of peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines compromise the BBB integrity, cross over to the brain vicinity, and activate its resident immune cells, causing microglial activation, which in turn creates a medium of neuroinflammation [297].",
            "Even out of the context of COVID-19, inflammation has been tightly intertwined with altered iron homeostasis [298]. Conditions of infection and inflammation, specifically high levels of IL-6, tend to increase the expression of hepcidin, which then degrades FPN1. This strategy helps iron sequestration from microorganisms by decreasing iron systemic availability [299–302]. However, iron hoarding in cells could have massive downsides. In the brain, a bidirectional relationship between iron overload and neuroinflammation creates a vicious cycle that could eventually boil down to ferroptosis-mediated neuronal death. In cases of neuroinflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) are reported to increase microglial and astrocytic hepcidin expression, which in turn degrades FPN1 in both cells and in neurons. Also, pro-inflammatory cytokines promote the overexpression of DMT1, which allows the importation of non-transferrin-bound iron in all three cells. However, the manipulation of iron transporters through pro-inflammatory cytokines seems to impact only neurons and microglia, resulting in cellular iron overload in these specific cells [303–305]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and iron overload activate microglia and increase its polarization from the anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2) to the pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1), which aggravates pro-inflammatory cytokine production, including NO [306]. Iron and pro-inflammatory cytokines activate the transcriptional factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which enhances the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), converting arginase into NO [307, 308]. Then, NO from the activated microglia gets to reshape neuronal iron homeostasis by targeting the IRE/IRP system [298, 309]. NO activates IRP1, which halts the translation of FPN1 and ferritin and promotes that of DMT1 and TfR1, favoring the increment of the cellular labile iron pool, which triggers the Fenton reaction and ferroptosis-mediated neuronal cell death [80, 310, 311]. However, the microglia tend to behave differently regarding handling iron according to their phenotype, which impacts their sensitivity to ferroptosis. M1 microglia are more resistant to ferroptosis than M2 microglia since they have less IRP activity and cellular labile iron pool, and higher ferritin levels, which help maintain neuroinflammation, perpetuate iron dysregulation, and ferroptosis-mediated neuronal death [298, 310, 312].",
            "Aging, including brain aging, is an intricate process with a multitude of underlying events such as inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic derangement, mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, and immunosenescence, in which cells attain SASP by releasing cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and reactive metabolites [313–315]. This multi-faceted process of aging seems to perfectly align with much of the COVID-19 pathophysiology [316, 317]. Progressive, persistent systemic inflammation with an ongoing rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and iNOS holds its position as a consequence of COVID-19 infection [318] and as a prelude to aging, a process termed inflammaging [315]. In a retrospective cohort of 272 of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-confirmed patients, serum inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2R (receptors) and IL-6 were detected in older patients (≥ 65 years). IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were significantly higher in severely ill patients from week 1 to week 5 post infection [319]. Also, the CSF IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, and monocyte inhibitory protein (MIP)-1β levels were higher in COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms compared to controls and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients, with evidence of BBB disruption [320]. Another tipping point where COVID-19 and aging seem to meet is iron dysregulation. During the process of aging, the systemic availability of iron tends to decline with higher levels of intracellular iron, posing the threat of inciting ferroptosis. The intracellular trapping of iron arises from the downregulation of FPN1 with high hepcidin levels due to aging-associated chronic inflammation [321–326]. Iron dysregulation is strongly associated with a premature phenotype of aging termed ferrosenescence, which is triggered by intracellular iron retention. This type of aging is characterized by DNA damage, telomere shortening, and methylation defects [327], which were reported in COVID-19 patients [113]. Telomere dysfunction seems to activate p53 cellular responses [328]. P53 is a key regulator of cells’ DNA repair mechanisms; however, viral infection-associated inflammatory responses could lead to the persistent activation of p53 [317]. In addition, iron overload tends to activate p53 acetylation and mediate M1 macrophage polarization in a p53-dependent manner, sustaining pro-inflammatory responses [329]. Also, NCOA4-mediated ferritin degradation was reported in the brains of aging mice [330].",
            "The massive cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 infection creates neuroinflammation, resembling one of the key events that fosters neurodegeneration [331]. AD brains reflect high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α secreted by activated microglia [332, 333]. Iron dysregulation is closely related to neurodegeneration. Brain iron is significantly elevated in different cortical regions in AD brain autopsies, with strong association between brain iron content and cognitive decline [334]. Iron exists within neurofibrillary tangles and accelerates tau phosphorylation [335]. Bao et al. reported the downregulation of FPN1, the only iron cellular exporter, in the hippocampus of the APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mouse model and in AD patients brain tissues. They developed a conditional FPN1 KO mouse model where the FPN1 is deleted in the principal neurons in the hippocampus and neocortex. The FPN1 deficiency resulted in cognitive impairment and an evident increase in ferroptosis markers. Also, the use of ferroptosis inhibitors ameliorated the Aβ-induced neuronal cell death and memory deficits [101]. Ferroptosis has emerged as a plausible culprit for AD pathology. In AD, iron overload activates microglia, which maintains neuroinflammation and AD-related protein aggregation. Iron activates NF-κB in microglia which triggers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including NO. NO can render microglia resistant to ferroptosis, which allows its continuous inflammatory response, inflicting harm on neurons and promoting their ferroptosis-mediated death [310].",
            "Besides the maliciously vicious cycle of iron dysregulation and neuroinflammation, SARS-CoV-2 renders cells vulnerable to ROS and lipid peroxidation through the collapse of antioxidant defenses and inhibition of the GPX4/GSH machinery. Also, SLC7A11 seems to be involved in the potential SARS-CoV-2- mediated ferroptosis [336–338]. P53 activation has been reported as an important player in the context of ferroptosis-related aging. P53 activation mediates ferroptosis by repressing the transcription of SLC7A11 or system Xc-, resulting in cysteine deficiency, GSH depletion, and ferroptosis [339, 340]. More interestingly, a higher labile iron pool with ferritin degradation was reported to enhance p53/SLC7A11-mediated ferroptosis [341]. Iron overload-triggered expression of p53 was reported to promote SLC7A11-repression mediated ferroptosis in aging neurons and in muscles [342, 343]. The transcription factor NrF2 stands as an opponent for SLC711-p53-mediated repression since it promotes the expression of SLC7A11 as one of its target genes, which opposes ferroptosis [344]. In addition, NrF2 increases the expression of H ferritin, which assists the intracellular storage of iron as ferritin and decreases the labile iron pool [105], a noble role that alleviates iron-related brain aging [345], and its absence could foster premature aging [346]. Keeping up with the notion of aligned events in aging and COVID-19 infection, suppressed NrF2-dependent gene expression was reported in COVID-19 patients, and NrF2 agonists halted SARS-CoV-2 replication [347]. Moreover, p53 activation is involved in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated neurotoxicity [348]. Higher expression of p53 and p21, an aging marker, mediated the senescence of retinal pigment epithelial cells treated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [349]. Neurodegeneration in COVID-19 patients is a potential consequence of GSH depletion and GPX4 inactivation [350], which would promote lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis [283]. GSH synthesis in AD is disrupted and associated with worsened pathology. Thioredoxin compromises an important step in the formation of GSH and was found reduced in AD brains [351]. Chiang et al. reported lower total glutathione levels in brain regions in AD patients with amyloid plaque deposition [352]. In a 5xFAD, five familial AD-related mutations, AD mouse model, mice exhibited markers for lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis along with cognitive decline, which improved with the generation of transgenic 5xFAD mice that overexpress GPX4 [353], displaying the crucial role of GPX4 in the mediation of ferroptosis-induced neurodegeneration.",
            "Another possible route for ferroptosis is direct viral neuropathology through the ACE-2 receptors. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE-2 receptors to enter cells, degrade them, and in turn increase Ag II which tends to act on angiotensin receptor 1 (ATR1). The activation of ATR1 would activate NOX enzymes, which promote the production of hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis [337]. Moreover, NOX is reported to increase microglial polarization towards the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, which would help maintain a state of neuroinflammation [354]. On the other hand, the activation of ACE2 receptors limits activated microglia polarization to the M1 phenotype and shifts its polarization to the M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype [355], which demonstrates the critical role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in neuroinflammation. RAS is another point where aging, ferroptosis, and COVID-19 meet [337], since RAS has been repeatedly implicated in aging. The activation of ATR1 was reported to activate p53/p21 and cause vascular senescence [356]. Ag II seems to induce vascular ferroptosis through activation of p53 [357]. ATR1/NOX activation promotes oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, age-related changes, and even iron-induced microglial pro-inflammatory polarization [354, 358, 359]. Ag II modulates iron homeostasis in aging, where it shows hyperactivity, associated oxidative stress, an inflammatory response, and increased microglial iron deposition. Also, chronic administration of Ag II resulted in lower levels of ferritin and an increased labile iron pool [360]. Ag II accelerates cellular senescence by causing DNA damage and telomere shortening [361]. Activation of ACE2 receptors and blocking ATR1 has been a recurrent theme in the context of AD to ameliorate cognitive functions, decrease brain pro-inflammatory cytokines, Aβ, and hyperphosphorylated tau burden [362–365]. Moreover, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is a crucial player for neurodevelopment and cognitive functions, showed lower levels in ACE2KO mice, with higher ATR1 expression and cognitive deficits [366].",
            "The altered expression of clock genes stands at the crossroads of ferroptosis, COVID-19, aging, and neurodegeneration. The circadian clock has been repeatedly implicated in viral replication, associated pathogenesis, and host responses, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. ACE2 receptor expression is controlled by the two circadian transcriptional factors, BMAL1/ARNTL and CLOCK [367–369]. Zhuang et al. demonstrated BMAL1/ARNTL-controlled SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and replication [370], manifesting a strong link between SARS-CoV-2 and clock genes. Moreover, variation in CLOCK and BMAL1/ARNTL expression in monocytes impacts cytokine production [371], showing the effect clock genes could have on COVID-19 progression. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 could alter the function of BMAL1/ARNTL and possibly other clock genes [367, 372]. BMAL1/ARNTL deficiency triggers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [373], which could pave the way for further consideration of BMAL1/ARNTL in the extended pathogenesis of COVID-19. A form of autophagic degradation of clock genes called clockophagy is reported to have a crucial role in ferroptosis. The autophagic degradation of BMAL1/ARNTL mediated by the cargo receptor SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome1) is reported to promote lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis [106, 374]. SQSTM1/p62 has been reported as a major player in the process of aging, with contradictory effects [375, 376]. Intriguingly, iron and clock genes happen to intersect with aging. Liu et al. reported a plausible and crucial role for iron accumulation in the altered circadian rhythm and clock gene expression associated with aging [377]. Clock gene disruption is a frequent finding with aging [378, 379]. BMAL1-deficient mice showed premature aging, higher production of ROS, and reduced life spans [380]. Also, Ali et al. reported accelerated aging with higher expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and cognitive deficits in BMAL1-deficient mice [381]. All this suggests clock genes, especially BMAL1, as a strong candidate in the pathogenesis of the possible COVID-19-induced acceleration of aging, with a potential role for iron disruption and ferroptosis.",
            "The circadian clock genes are implicated in neurodegeneration [382] as well as the pathogenesis of COVID-19 [367]. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,4,5-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated Parkinson’s mouse model showed inactivation of the main circadian transcriptional factor, BMAL1/ARNTL, resulting in motor dysfunction, dopaminergic neuron loss, and aggravated activated microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, displaying the role of BMAL1/ARNTL in microglial pro-inflammatory responses [383]. In an AD mouse model, cognitive decline was associated with BMAL1/ARNTL deficiency, which promoted microglial-derived chronic inflammation through NF-κB activation [384]. The autophagic degradation, or clockophagy, of BMAL1/ARNTL1 promotes ferroptosis [374, 385]. This alludes to the hypothesis that COVID-19-mediated dysfunctional activity and degradation of BMAL1/ARNTL can mediate chronic microglial-inflammatory responses and neuronal ferroptosis-mediated demise.",
            "Melatonin has been previously introduced as a ferroptosis inhibitor in various contexts; however, we reintroduce melatonin in a new light as a plausible protagonist, mitigating the post-COVID-19 trajectory of aging and neurodegeneration. By tracking the previously proposed hypothesis, we find melatonin brings the answer in every step (Fig. 10).Fig. 10Melatonin as a ferroptosis inhibitor in the post-COVID-19 trajectory of aging and neurodegeneration. Melatonin as an anti-inflammatory can ease the impact of the SARS-COV-2-induced cytokine storm, which would decrease the chances of BBB disruption and passage of pro-inflammatory cytokines to the brain vicinity. Melatonin can reduce the microglial activation and polarization from M2 (anti-inflammatory) to M1 (pro-inflammatory), which increases the production of BDNF, IL-9, IL-10, and TGF-β. The lower incidencce of neuroinflammation would decrease the chances of iron dysregulation. Melatonin decreses the expression of NF-κB, which decreases the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and NO, protecting against its harmful impact on iron molecular regulatory machinery (IRE/IRP). Melatonin also can act as iron chelator, diminishing the iron overload/neuroinflammation cycle. Melatonin decreases can activate the SLC7A11 by activating the NrF2 and depression of P53, which would accommodate production of GSH. Also, melatonin acts as an antioxidant by direct scavenging of ROS, helping production of GSH and GPX4, and iron chelation. Melatonin can interfere with the binding of spike protein to ACE2 and can act as an antagonist against Ag II, which would decrease the activation of NOX and production of H2O2. Melatonin can inhibit the process of clockophagy and prevent the deficiency of BMAL1 and CLOCK, decreasing ROS production, lipid peroxidation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines production. Melatonin can reduce lipid peroxidation by inhibiting ACSL4 and LOX, which would decrease the PUFA incorporation in cell membranes and the production of PUFAOOH.

            "Melatonin can mediate its anti-ferroptotic effect by being an efficient anti-inflammatory. Melatonin counteracts inflammation by inhibiting microglail activation and its polarization to the proinflammatory M1 phenotype [386, 387]. Melatonin can foster the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, IL-19, and tumor growth factor (TGF)-β, along with increased expression of BDNF in microglia [388]. In cellular and mouse PD models, melatonin decreased the polarization of microglia to M1 and increased the anti-inflammatory M2 through upregulation of its RORα receptors that were downregulated with PD induction [389]. In a D-galactose model of accelerated aging, melatonin improved memory through inhibition of microgliosis and downregulation of NF-κB and NOS [390]. Melatonin inhibits the activity of iNOS and the production of NO [213], which stands behind the anti-ferroptosis action of melatonin in intervertebral disc degeneration [391]. The reduction of iNOS can abolish its ferroptosis resistence effect on M1 microglia, cutting the continuum of the state of neuroinflammation [392].",
            "Melatonin does not stop at being an anti-inflammatory but rather modulates iron homeostasis and works as an iron chelator with a ferrous iron (Fe+2) chelating capacity, which makes it excel at breaking the iron dysregulation/neurinflammation cycle [393, 394]. Another interesting action for melatonin is that it can form complexes with ferric iron (Fe+3) and hence reduce its reduction to ferrous and the resulting free radicals [395]. In several preclinical studies, melatonin has proven itself worthy in the protection of neurons against iron-induced toxicity [396–399]. Ortega-Gutierrez et al. reported that melatonin enhances the anti-oxidant effect of deferoxamine against lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates [400]. Melatonin inhibited NCOA4-mediated ferroptosis in age-related cataracts with higher expression of GPX and H ferritin [401]. In a mouse model of traumatic brain injury (TBI), melatonin exerted an anti-inflammatory and anti-ferroptotic effect through its action on MT2 receptors and upregulation of IL-33 and H ferritin. Interestingly, the protective effect of melatonin was abolished after the deletion of H ferritin, emphasizing the anti-ferroptotic role of melatonin through working on iron homeostasis [402]. Rui et al. reported similar results in a TBI model where melatonin alleviated TBI-induced ferroptosis, associated behavioral deficits, neuronal injury, and cortical volume loss. Melatonin also decreased the number of iron-positive cells, alleviating TBI-induced iron accumulation. However, in H ferritin KO mice, melatonin relinquished its protective effect. On all levels, melatonin exerted a similar outcome to liproxstatin-1, a known ferroptosis inhibitor, making its mark as a genuine ferroptosis inhibitor [74]. In an acute sleep deprivation-associated memory loss model, melatonin decreased memory deficits, iron-positive cells, and dysregulation in iron transporters TfR1, DMT1, and FPN1 [403].",
            "The positive reputation of melatonin as an iron chelator in iron-overload-related disorders is only surpassed by its long-standing reputation as an anti-oxidant. Melatonin tips the scale of the oxidative status in favor of antioxidants, activating multiple antioxidant enzymes, such as GPX4 and SOD, and scavenging for ROS. The direct ROS scavenging capacity of melatonin interferes with the labile iron-induced fenton reaction, minimizing iron-induced damage [404–406] and raising melatonin’s chances as a sophisticated ferroptosis inhibitor. One of melatonin’s key actions as an antioxidant is to promote the function of NrF2 [407]. Through its action on MT2, melatonin activated NrF2 and protected against ferroptosis in a subarachnoid hemorrhage rat model. The blocking of MT2 eliminated melatonin’s protective effect [408]. In radiation-induced neuronal injury and cognitive impairment, melatonin-receiving mice showed improvement on the cognitive level. Melatonin alleviated the underlying ferroptosis in hippocampal neurons by reversing the downregulation of NrF2, GPX4, and SLC7A11 [409]. In a hypoxic ischemic brain damage model, melatonin-receiving rats showed improved memory and learning. Melatonin protected hippocampal neurons against ferroptosis by enhancing the NrF2/GPX4 pathway [410]. Melatonin can act against GSH depletion through its positive effect on the antiporter SLC7A11. As mentioned, melatonin helps the upregulation of SLC7A11 by promoting the function of NrF2 [409, 411–413] and inhibiting the repressor function of p53 on SLC7A11 [414, 415]. By working smarter, not harder, melatonin can decrease the availabilityof PUFA and therefore cut off the fuel for ROS production and lipid peroxidation. Melatonin decreases the expression of ACSL4, which works in favor of decreased incorporation of PUFA in cell membranes [391, 408, 416, 417]. In addition, melatonin protects against ferroptosis by reducing the expression of the H2O2-producing LOX enzymes [414, 418] and has the potential to do so by reducing the expression of the H2O2-producing NOX enzymes [419–422].",
            "The era of SARS-CoV-2 brings the old nuance of the melatonin-angiotensin axis to light. Interestingly, Ag II, which accumulates with COVID-19-mediated degradation of ACE2 receptors [337], works on pinealocytes, activating tryptophan hydroxylase and limiting melatonin synthesis [195]. This goes in line with the remarks about possible deficient melatonin in COVID-19 patients, especially those suffering from insomnia [423]. Also, melatonin happens to interact with ACE2 receptors, changing their interface and capacity to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, decreasing brain viral load and inflammation [278]. Ag II-induced ferroptosis was detected in astrocytes [424], vascular endodthelial cells [357], and cardiomyocytes [425]. The antagonistic relationship between melatonin and Ag II was repeatedly displayed, with melatonin playing a protective role against Ag II-induced injury [426–431]. These reports open new prospects for melatonin as a ferroptosis inhibitor through modulating the RAS system and inhibiting Ag II.",
            "Another unique way for melatonin to act as a ferroptosis inhibitor is through its interaction with clock genes. In an ethanol-induced liver injury model, melatonin exerted NrF2-mediated anti-ferroptosis action through the modulation of BMAL1 [432]. Notably, melatonin happens to downregulate the elevated SQSTM1/p62 in ALS and in AD mouse models [254, 433]. These findings promote the hypothesis of melatonin acting against SQSTM1/p62, the cargo receptor that incites autophagic degradation or clockophagy of BMAL1/ARNTL and, by extension, the resulting ferroptosis [374]. Li et al. reported a decreased expression of CLOCK, CRY1, PER1, and PER2 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 326 PD patients compared to their healthy controls, along with a decreased concentration of melatonin [434]. A three-month administration of 25 mg/d of melatonin increased the expression of BMAL1 in the peripheral blood of 26 PD patients in a randomized clinical trial [435]. In aged Wistar rats, the loss of rhythmic expression of BMAL1, Cry1, and Cry2 was reversed by an eleven-day melatonin administration [436]. These studies build up the possibility of melatonin being able to reverse the underling BMAL1 deficiency-induced ferroptosis in post-COVID-19 aging and neurodegeneration.",
            "Over the years, melatonin’s properties unfolded as a circadian regulator, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, immune modulator, iron chelator, and, lately, an anti-ferroptosis. Melatonin was always in the picture when it came to viral breakouts, and history repeated itself with the gloomy era of COVID-19, with melatonin being, once again, an efficient anti-viral. With the catastrophe of COVID-19 fading away, its aftermath is becoming more evident in the form of accelerated brain aging and neurodegeneration. With its widely reported role in combating the underlying pathologies of aging and multiple neurodegenerative disorders, melatonin becomes such a unique, well-fitting solution for the post-COVID-19 trajectory of aging and neurodegeneration. Another appealing trait of melatonin in such a predicament is its ability to inhibit ferroptosis, which is a strongly proposed underlying mechanism for post-COVID-19 aging and neurodegeneration. COVID-19, aging, and neurodegenerative disorders share five events that end up in ferroptosis, which are neuroinflammation, iron dysregulation, anti-oxidant defense repression, ACE2/Ag II disruption, and clock gene alterations. Luckily, melatonin can tackle all five events, making it the perfect ferroptosis inhibitor against the ferroptosis-induced post-COVID-19 aging and neurodegeneration.",

            "To describe the possible neuroinvasion pathways of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the Coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) pandemic.",
            "We present data regarding the family of Coronaviruses (CoVs) and the central nervous system (CNS), and describe parallels between SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the family, which have been investigated in more depth and combine these findings with the recent advancements regarding SARS-CoV-2.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 like other CoVs is neuroinvasive, neurotropic and neurovirulent. Two main pathways of CNS penetration seem to be the strongest candidates, the hematogenous and the neuronal. Τhe olfactory route in particular appears to play a significant role in neuroinvasion of coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, as well. However, existing data suggest that other routes, involving the nasal epithelium in general, lymphatic tissue and the CSF may also play roles in SARS-CoV-2 invasion into the CNS.",
            "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses, capable of infecting many species of birds and mammals [1–3]. There are seven coronaviruses known to infect humans, called human coronaviruses (HCoVs) [4–6]. Clinically, infection with a coronavirus can be either asymptomatic or present with respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI), and neurological symptoms [7]. Four HCoVs, namely 229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63, are not considered to be very pathogenic [8, 9], while the rest, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have caused two epidemics so far [8, 10–12], and the novel SARS-CoV-2 caused the current pandemic [13–16]; all these viral strands can lead to acute respiratory failure.",
            "In this review, we aim to shed some light into how this novel virus can impact the central nervous system (CNS) by describing the routes of its invasion into the CNS.",
            "Many studies have shown that coronaviruses are neuroinvasive, neurotropic, and neurovirulent in animals and humans [17–22]. In animals, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the coronavirus family, can infect microglia and astrocytes [23], as well as Koppler cells at choroid plexuses; a systemic model of infection with SARS-CoV showed that the virus reached the brain [24]. It has also been reported that human coronaviruses have the ability to infect primary cultures of human neural cells, fetal and adult astrocytes, adult microglia and adult oligodendrocytes [25–27]. [Fig. 1].Fig. 1A normal neuron and a neuron and astrocytes as infected with coronavirus.",
            "A normal neuron and a neuron and astrocytes as infected with coronavirus.",
            "The detection of HCoVs in human CNS samples was described in the early 1980s, in autopsy tissues of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) [28]. RNA from endemic prototype HCoV strains OC43 and 229E has also been detected in human brain samples [19], and can persist over time [29]. Neurological manifestations have also been described in the symptom constellation of the two previous epidemics of MERS- [30, 31] and SARS-CoV [32], where the virus was also detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [21, 32, 33]. More specifically, it was shown that SARS-CoV could induce cerebral edema and meningeal vasodilation [34], neuronal morphological changes in the cortex and hypothalamus [35], neuronal ischemic lesions and necrosis, glial hyperplasia [36] and demyelination, while its genome sequences (viral particles) have also been detected in brain samples of infected patients [34–41].",
            "Consequently, it comes as no surprise that a SARS-CoV-2 infection may present with neurological manifestations and CNS symptoms at high rates [42, 43], such as headache, confusion [44] and sensory disturbances, namely anosmia and ageusia [42•]. Additionally, entities such as encephalitis [45], acute cerebrovascular diseases [42, 46], acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) [47], as well as demyelination and neuropathy [22] have also been reported in the current pandemic. Furthermore, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been established in the CSF of patients with acute neurologic symptoms, like seizures [48, 49] or encephalitis [45], at times combined with MRI findings pertaining to the condition at hand [48•]. Post-mortem examination of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in endothelial cells and pericytes of brain capillaries [50•] and neurons [50, 51], further confirming the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS. It has also been postulated that the presence of the virus in areas of the medulla, and the cardiorespiratory center in particular, may be one of the likely causes of COVID-19’s respiratory failure [22, 52].",
            "It was quickly established that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the receptor of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than the other HCoVs, due to some structural differences in its “Receptor Binding Domain” of the S spike protein (S) [15, 53, 54]. Receptors of ACE2 exist in almost all human organs [55, 56], as well as in endothelial cells [52] and the CNS [55] [Fig. 2]. As such, it is highly likely that SARS-CoV-2, similarly to SARS-CoV [57, 58], makes use of these receptors in order to penetrate these tissues and trigger the perpetuation of immune responses [59] or finally invade the CNS, via the different pathways that we describe below.Figure 2Entry of the virus into the host CNS-related cell and further spread. The single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) encodes large polyproteins, which are proteolytically cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps). In addition, 9–12 ORFs are encoded through the transcription of a nested set of subgenomic RNAs. The virus forms spherical particles consisting of four structural proteins: the envelope glycoprotein spike (S), the envelope (E) and membrane (M) transmembrane glycoproteins incorporated in the virion, and the protein nucleocapsid (N). The surface protein of the virus binds to its receptors, such as ACE 2. Following the entry of the virus into the host cell (such as the neuron), and the release of the viral genome, the viral RNA is uncoated in the cytoplasm. Translation of the viral polymerase protein is followed by RNA replication and subgenomic transcription; ORF1a and ORF1ab are translated to create pp1a and pp1ab, which are cleaved by the proteases that are encoded by ORF1a to produce 16 nsps that form the RNA replicase–transcriptase complex. During the phase of replication, full-length (−)RNA copies of the genome are shaped and form templates for full-length (+)RNA genomes. Subgenomic (−)RNAs are transcribed into subgenomic (+)mRNAs. The step of translation is followed by the assembling of the resulting structural proteins into the nucleocapsid and viral envelope at the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), followed by release of the nascent virion from the infected neuron cell.

            "Viremia follows the primary infection, and is the phase when most neurotropic viruses are present into the bloodstream, where they possibly stay for a period of time, before they finally reach the CNS [60]. Although HCoVs seem to mainly infect the respiratory tract and be self-restricting, they can potentially disrupt the epithelium barrier and invade the bloodstream [18]. Type II alveolar epithelial cells, which highly express ACE2, are the cells mainly infected by SARS-CoVs [39], thus allowing entrance of the virus to the blood circulation. Another possible pathway to the blood circulation could be through the epithelial cells of the GI tract [59], which also express ACE2 receptors and can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 [61–63]. While other pathways cannot be excluded, passage through the respiratory tract is the most plausible scenario.",
            "Once in the blood circulation, SARS-CoV-2 could bind to the ACE2 receptors of the endothelium [50, 52, 55] and disrupt the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB), inducing edema, intracranial hypertension and/or penetration of the virus in the CNS [64, 65]. Neuroinvasion has been described for other coronaviruses in the past [29, 66]. In greater detail, Cabirac et al. (1993) showed that intravenous (IV) inoculation with MHV in owl monkeys led to brain and spinal cord infection, with the presence of viral RNA and/or antigen in the brain sites of inflammation, the blood vessels, and the endothelium [67]. Additionally, MERS-CoV can access the bloodstream, subsequently infecting endothelial cells in vivo [68]. Finally, Paniz-Mondolfi et al., (2020) observed viral-like particles of SARS-CoV-2 in the endothelial cells and pericytes of brain capillaries as well as astrocytic processes, which actively overrode the BBB [50•], strongly supporting a hematogenous-endothelial neuroinvasion-based hypothesis for SARS-CoV-2.",
            "In a similar way, it can be postulated that SARS-CoV-2 could also infect the endothelial cells of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), and then spread into the CNS. Moreover, the choroid plexus and the circumventricular cerebral organs are not protected by the BBB, and could thus be gates for the penetration of a virus into the CNS [69].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 could also enter the CNS under conditions promoting an increase of the permeability of the BBB, as a result of the release of inflammatory mediators (chemokines, cytokines) [70], and even a cytokine storm, following inflammation or hypoxemia induced by the respiratory distress syndrome, or even psychological stress [59, 71–73]. This paracellular transmigration pathway is mainly mediated by the destabilization or disruption of the tight junctions of the BBB [69].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 could also infect bloodstream leukocytes (mainly monocytes/macrophages) [65] and myeloid cells, which become a viral pool for the diffusion of the virus towards the CNS [69, 74, 75]. SARS-CoV can infect lymphocytes and monocytes near the vessel wall [34, 35, 38] and seems to use this “Trojan Horse” mechanism [18, 76]. Other coronaviruses present similar abilities; MHV can infect macrophages [23], while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E can infect human monocytes/macrophages [76, 77]. In addition, HCoV-229E was able to infect murine and human dendritic cells in vitro [78], which express the human aminopeptidase N (CD13) leading to their subsequent activation [79]. SARS-CoV is also speculated to have as a binding receptor, the human CD13 [80]. It has been shown to infect immune cells, monocytes, macrophages and T lymphocytes in particular, which are consistently reduced in these patients (lymphopenia), even at early disease stages [35], something that has been reported for SARS-CoV-2 patients as well [42•]. Thus, we can hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 uses immune circulating cells [42•] and dendritic cells to disseminate into other tissues and the CNS. It is possible that monocytes/macrophages could also be a “future” source of SARS-CoV-2, as is the case of other HCoVs [19], since the infection of these leukocytic cell lines can persist over time [76].",
            "Another possible pathway for the penetration into the CNS for SARS-CoV-2 could be the neuronal pathway. Some viruses can invade from the nerve “ending”, i.e. the peripheral nerves [64, 81]. However, some viruses can invade from the nerve “ending”, i.e. the peripheral nerves [81], and by the mechanism of active transport within the neurons, more specifically through the motor proteins kinesin and dynein [69], and via microtubules, travel in a retrograde way and reach the CNS [82]. These neurons could be motor, sensory or autonomic neurons, but are most often olfactory neurons [69, 81, 83].",
            "Τhere is growing evidence that CoVs may initially infect peripheral nerve endings and then enter the CNS through a synapse-connected route [84–86]. This trans-synaptic transmission has been well documented for some CoVs, such as HEV67 [84, 85, 87, 88]. There is also data supporting the notion that HCoV-OC43 might also penetrate the CNS through cranial peripheral nerves [40], as occurs with other respiratory viruses [respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus] [81]. Dubé et.al (2018) showed that viral particles could be passively released/diffused or transported via axonal transport (neuron-to-neuron) by axoplasmic flow in cell cultures [40]. It also appears that neurons are very sensitive to SARS-CoV infection, due to their host cell receptors [39]. More specifically, the S1 unit of the S protein of the virus binds to ACE2 receptor of the neuron and with the action of the serine protease transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) activates the S protein, that allows the virus to invade the neuron [89].",
            "The olfactory pathway is an excellent neuronal pathway for neuroinvasive respiratory viruses [81] that access the body intranasally [64], as the olfactory nerve communicates both with the nasal epithelium and the olfactory bulb [64, 69]. This pathway seems to be one possible mechanism of neuroinvasion for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 [39, 90, 91].",
            "In animal models, intranasal inhalation of CoVs can lead to cerebral infection. For example, MHV induced infection in mice, and its RNA was detected in brain and muscles [92]. HCoV-OC43 also invades the CNS via the neuroepithelium and starts neuropropagation at the olfactory bulbs [40, 92, 93]. It has been reported that 3 days after nasal inoculation in mice, viral antigens of HCoV-OC43 can be found in the olfactory bulb [both in the olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) and in dendrites-associated cilia [40]] while no virus is found in perivascular blood cells or other CNS sites [93]. The virus then has the ability to reach highly susceptible regions of the cortex, the mesolimbic cortex or other areas associated with olfaction [40], such as the hippocampus and the amygdala, and finally through trans-neuronal propagation, it may reach the brainstem and the spinal cord [94]. The virus can be detected in the entirety of the brain just 7 days after the nasal inoculation, suggesting a relatively rapid dissemination once it invades the CNS, leading to acute encephalitis and death [93]. Moreover, ablation of the olfactory bulb after nasal infection of MHV blocked the spread [95], strongly supporting the olfactory pathway dissemination theory. SARS-CoV, which is homologous to SARS-CoV-2, was also detected in the CNS of susceptible mice after intranasal infection, showing its neuroinvasive capabilities [39, 73]. More specifically, Netland et al. (2008) detected SARS-CoV in the olfactory bulb of mice approximately 3 days after nasal inhalation, and in the mesolimbic cortex only 1 day later, in addition to other brain regions and the brainstem, invading almost the entirety of the brain [39].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 might also be transferred to the CNS through the trigeminal nerve, which innervates nociceptive cells in the nasal cavity, and has been successfully tested for drug transportation [96, 97]. Sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve also exist in the conjunctiva, where SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments have been found in a patient with conjunctivitis [98], and in the taste buds, ascending not only in trigeminal nuclei, but also to the nuclei of the solitary tract [59].",
            "It has been demonstrated that some viruses, such as influenza, can enter the CNS via the sensory fiber of the vagus nerve in the respiratory tract [81, 86, 99–101]. This also represents another communication route between the emesis center, the vagus nerve and the GI tract, which may play a role in this retrograde penetration of the SARS-CoV-2 to the CNS [59]. In addition, local peripheral nerves from the GI system might be infected, as SARS-CoV-2 also infects the GI tract [61–63]. As noted above, many researchers have demonstrated that the brain stem is an area that is particularly infected by SARS-CoV [39, 73] and MERS-CoV [91]; this adds support to the notion that through trans-synaptic transmission, SARS-CoV-2 might also infect the brainstem from the respiratory system [52]. However, no direct proof that SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs use the vagus nerve for neuroinvasive purposes has been published [59].",
            "It is worth mentioning that dyspnea may stem from the primary CNS infection, mainly through the olfactory mechanism that leads to the brainstem, where the stem nuclei and the solitary tract are connected to the respiratory system [52, 102]. Netland et al. (2008) demonstrated that the main gate of SARS-CoV infection in mice was the olfactory pathway and could lead to death. However, the presence of the virus in lungs was low suggesting that infected neurons in the medulla and the cardiorespiratory center were responsible for this outcome [39]. This scenario proposes that direct infection of the CNS might be the primary gate of the virus in the organism [39, 52]. Additionally, postmortem examination of SARS-CoV patients detected viral particles in the brain almost exclusively in neurons, rather than in glia [34–36], adding more support to the neuronal rather than the hematogenous pathway.",
            "A recent study found that the genes for ACE2 receptors and TMPRSS2, responsible for the binding of SARS-CoV-2, are expressed in the olfactory epithelial support and stem cells, but not in the olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) of mice and humans [103]. It has also been demonstrated that nasal inoculation of HCoV-229E to human volunteers disrupted the nasal epithelium, damaging and decreasing the number of the ciliated cells [104]. Perineural spaces of olfactory nerves and the nasal lymphatic tissue are important for drainage of the CSF, as they communicate with the CSF through channels made by the ensheathing cells [105, 106]. That means that the nasal olfactory epithelium and its lymphatic tissue may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion in another indirect pathway.",
            "Lymphatic endothelial cells express receptors of CD209L, another receptor for SARS-CoVs, with lower affinity than ACE2 that is expressed mainly in lymphatic and liver tissues [107, 108]. It has been described that human hilar and mesenteric lymph nodes can be invaded by SARS-CoV [109, 110]. It is not unreasonable to hypothesize that other lymphatic networks, like those in oral tissues [111] or in the ocular mucosa [112] could be targets for SARS-CoV-2. Following this train of thought, the case of a patient presenting with seizures and SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF, 10 days after conjunctivitis [49], demonstrates possible neuroinvasion through the conjunctiva. According to this theory, viremia could be the sequela of infection of lymphatic tissue in the affected organ, such as the respiratory or GI tract [18, 59], leading to the neuroinvasion via the aforementioned hematogenous route.",
            "The CNS microenvironment following SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented at Fig. 3 [Fig. 3].Fig. 3The CNS microenvironment following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Spread of SARS-CoV-2 from lungs to the CNS can most likely be achieved through the haematogenous route. In addition, it can enter the CNS through the olfactory bulb, and once the infectious agent persists due to the inability of the immune system to control/suppress viral replication, the virus may reach the whole brain and the CSF, and participate in demyelination. In the hematogenous route, SARS-CoV-2 may gain access by infecting endothelial cells of the blood-brain-barrier, epithelial cells of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in the choroid plexus, or it may indeed use inflammatory cells as “Trojan horse” to obtain access into the CNS. Experimental data suggest that primary glial cultures can secrete a series of inflammatory cytokines participating in the perpetuation of viral infection and further inflicting CNS tissue damage. The role of astrocytes in the machinery of SARS-CoV-2 mediated CNS pathology is yet undetermined and remains to be defined.",

            "In an attempt to understand the possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, it is reasonable to study the neuroinvasive behavior of known CoVs that have been studied for a longer period of time. The two basic common pathways for viral neuroinvasion that have been better described so far are hematogenous and neuronal. It has been demonstrated that coronaviruses can use either pathway to achieve CNS penetration. SARS-CoV-2 seems to not be an exception, as it shares common features with the other coronaviruses and can induce neurological symptoms. There are indications that SARS-CoV-2 can take advantage of both the hematogenous and neuronal routes, as it principally uses the ACE2 receptor that exists in circulatory and nervous systems. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 may also penetrate lymphatic tissues leading to entrance to the CNS.",
            "Based on the data presented in this review, the CNS may be affected by a subsequent effect of a primary systemic infection, through hematogenous or neuronal pathways. However, the CNS may also be the primary entry organ, infected mainly through the olfactory route, via which the virus enters the boby and spreads to other systems. In that case, the aforementioned “neurogenic hypothesis” is reinforced, and this invasion route could be particularly dangerous, as it could lead to the infection of the brainstem and the respiratory center, causing respiratory failure. More research is needed to confirm these hypotheses and will lead to more efficient therapeutic and preventive strategies.",

However, there are still many issues of concern to be clarified. Therefore, we review the current literature on the complex relationship between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases with an emphasis on Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We summarize the impact of COVID-19 infection on symptom severity, disease progression, and mortality rate of PD and AD, and discuss whether COVID-19 infection could trigger PD and AD. In addition, the susceptibility to and the prognosis of COVID-19 in PD patients and AD patients are also included. In order to achieve better management of PD and AD patients, modifications of care strategies, specific drug therapies, and vaccines during the pandemic are also listed.

            "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic induced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a great threat to the lives of humans all over the world. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that infects the respiratory system in humans and causes serious illness, including severe pneumonia and neurological disorders [1, 2]. Accumulating evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection might interfere with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), leading to worsening of symptoms or even acceleration of disease progression [3–7]. Coronaviruses can be detected in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients with PD and AD [8]. COVID-19 infection develops as the glycoprotein spike of the virus binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which are widespread in the brain. COVID-19 could lead to accelerated aging in the brain [9, 10]. Furthermore, patients with PD and AD have been reported with higher risks of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality, indicating a close link between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases [11–14].",
            "Recently, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the specific neurological manifestations of COVID-19, has aroused great interest [15, 16]. However, there are still many issues of concern to be clarified. For example, it remains unclear how COVID-19 infection affects the symptom severity, disease progression, and neurodegeneration-related mortality, and whether COVID-19 infection could trigger neurodegenerative diseases. And vice versa, it remains uncertain how neurodegenerative diseases impact COVID-19, susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly changed the medical care model for PD and AD patients. Drug therapies for neurodegenerative diseases were also reported to impact the COVID-19 infection, and vaccines might interfere with neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, comprehensive modification of care strategies in patients with neurodegenerative diseases during the pandemic and a summary of drug therapies and vaccines related to the neurodegenerative diseases are very necessary for the management of these patients. In addition, mechanisms underlying the link between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases need to be revealed. Therefore, we sought to review the current literature on the complex relationship between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases with an emphasis on PD and AD.",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic is considered to worsen the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD patients, and trigger new symptoms or problems by direct and indirect ways.",
            "Infection is a common cause for the exacerbation of parkinsonian symptoms [17]. A severe infection such as COVID-19 could have a direct harmful impact on PD motor symptoms, which deteriorate during the period of systemic inflammation [18]. A large online study (Fox Insight) has investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on PD patients [3]. Data were collected from 5429 PD patients with 51 reporting COVID-19 positive diagnoses in the US. Among those infected, 55% reported worsening of at least one existing motor symptom and 18% reported occurrence of new motor symptoms [3]. New occurrence or worsening of non-motor symptoms was also noted, including mood symptoms (71%), sleep disruptions (62%), cognitive problems (49%), and dysautonomia (38%) [3]. However, the underlying mechanism of the direct harmful effect of COVID-19 on PD is still unclear. Possible explanations include insufficient response to dopaminergic drugs after infection, altered transport of dopaminergic drugs through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) after systemic infection, and altered dopamine metabolism and receptor signaling due to the response to proinflammatory cytokines. Inflammatory processes outside the brain may lead to the boosting of pre-existing neuroinflammatory processes in PD [19].",
            "COVID-19 also affects motor and non-motor symptoms in PD through indirect ways, such as dramatic change in routine life, social isolation, stress, anxiety and prolonged immobility [20]. In the Fox Insight online study, PD patients without COVID-19 reported disrupted medical care (64%), exercise (21%), and social activities (57%), and worsening of motor (43%) and non-motor (52%) symptoms during the pandemic [3]. An online survey of 498 PD patients in the Netherlands showed that 46.6% of PD patients were less physically active since the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the worsening of PD symptoms (including rigidity, fatigue, tremor, and pain). Patients with a higher level of COVID-19-related stress experience severer PD symptoms, and this effect is mediated by the degree of psychological distress [21]. A survey of 733 COVID-19-negative PD patients in Tuscany reported worsening of motor symptoms (29.6%), mood problems (24.7%), and insomnia (22.2%) during the COVID-19 pandemic [22]. In a telephone-based survey of 568 Spanish patients, 65.7% of patients reported worsening of their symptoms (bradykinesia 47.7%, sleep problems 41.4%, rigidity 40.7%, gait disturbances 34.5%, anxiety 31.3%, pain 28.5%, fatigue 28.3%, depression 27.6%, tremor 20.8%, and appetite disorders 13.2%) during the pandemic [23]. We also conducted an online survey of 1764 PD patients in China during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022 (unpublished data). In this survey, 200 PD patients had experienced isolation and only 3 of them reported COVID-19 positive diagnoses. The results showed that 50% of the PD patients reported worsening of symptoms during the pandemic, and this percentage increased to 61% among isolated PD patients. For details, severer motor symptoms during the pandemic were reported by the PD patients, including tremor (21.7%), bradykinesia (37.9%), rigidity (30.5%), and postural disability (20.1%), especially in isolated PD patients (26.5%, 46.5%, 35.5%, and 24.5%, respectively). The top three aggravated non-motor symptoms in PD patients during the pandemic included constipation (27.4%), fatigue (23.8%), and sleep disturbance (23.1%), and these proportions increased among the isolated patients (31.5%, 27.5%, and 32.5%, respectively). The data suggested that a majority of PD patients experience the deterioration of symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic without infection. This phenomenon may be explained by a marked reduction in physical activities, increased psychological stress, and difficulties in getting access to dopaminergic drugs or medical care due to the COVID-19 lockdown [20].",
            "In conclusion, COVID-19 exacerbates motor and non-motor symptoms in PD patients both directly and indirectly. PD patients experiencing activity restriction during the pandemic have increased rates of symptom deterioration than usual, regardless of COVID-19 positivity. The indirect effects of COVID-19 might be more detrimental than the virus itself since infection only occurs in a small number of PD patients but the COVID-19 pandemic could indirectly affect a larger population.",
            "Most of the present literature on COVID-19 and PD focuses on the impact of infection itself and its effects on motor and non-motor symptoms in PD. However, whether COVID-19 has an influence on the disease progression of PD remains unclear. Only one retrospective longitudinal study focused on the disease progression rate of PD during the COVID-19 pandemic. In that retrospective longitudinal study of 264 PD patients in Switzerland, motor disease progression measured by the third part of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society (MDS) was compared before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic [4]. Significant worsening of motor symptoms and increased motor disease progression were observed during pandemic-related restrictions as compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic [4]. Additionally, a trend analysis of the yearly evolution of motor symptoms in 755 PD patients from 2016 to 2021 showed that in contrast to the slow progression of mean MDS-UPDRS III scores from 2016 till the onset of the pandemic crisis (beginning of 2020), there was a steep, pharmacotherapy-independent increase from 2020 onwards (during the crisis) while the mean levodopa equivalent dose remained unchanged between 2016 and 2021[4]. This study demonstrated that the increase of symptom progression is not due to a potential reduction in medication. The COVID-19 pandemic, during which PD patients may go through immobility, social isolation, and psychological stress, may exacerbate motor symptoms and increase disease progression [4].",
            "A study in Italy investigated the long-term trends and impact of COVID-19 pandemic waves on PD-related mortality [11]. In that study, 13,746 PD-related deaths (2.3% of all deaths) were identified during 2008–2020, with proportional mortality increased from 1.9% (2008) to 2.8% (2020) [11]. The PD-related mortality rate when considering PD as one among multiple causes reported in death certificates during 2020 was 28%, showing two peaks corresponding to the first (March to May, 28%) and second (October to December, 59%) pandemic waves that occurred in Italy [11]. Generally, PD-related mortality rates were steeply increased during the COVID-19 pandemic [11]. A retrospective review of 70 PD inpatients in New York found that PD patients with COVID-19 infection had a higher mortality rate compared to those not infected (35.8% vs 5.9%, P = 0.028) [24]. Age older than 70 years, advanced stage of PD disease, and reductions of medication were risk factors for higher mortality rate [24]. Furthermore, a multicenter study of 117 community-dwelling PD patients with COVID-19 in Italy, Iran, Spain, and the UK reported an overall mortality of 19.7%, with dementia, hypertension, and advanced PD increasing the risk of mortality [25]. In all, PD-related mortality rates have increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with older age, advanced course, reduction of medication, and comorbidities are more likely to have increased risk of mortality.",
            "However, negative findings have also been reported. In a case–control survey of 1486 PD patients and 1207 family members (controls) from Italy, 6 patients (5.7%) and 7 family members (7.6%) died from COVID-19. Mortality and COVID-19 risk in this cohort of PD patients did not differ from the general population [26]. The mortality rate was probably under-represented as this study which only enrolled community-dwelling PD patients, while patients living in nursing homes or other long-term care facilities where outbreaks with high mortality rates had been reported were excluded.",
            "A meta-analysis of the impact of viral and bacterial infections on the risk of developing PD indicated that individuals with infection had a 20% increased risk of PD compared with controls [27]. Méndez-Guerrero and colleagues [28] were the first to report a 58-year-old patient who developed an asymmetric hypokinetic-rigid syndrome with hyposmia and ocular abnormalities after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography demonstrated an asymmetric decrease of presynaptic dopamine uptake within the putamen. Parkinsonian symptoms were improved spontaneously without any specific treatment [28]. Furthermore, Cohen and colleagues [29] reported a 45-year-old patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 who developed moderate rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, slightly slow gait, and hypophonia. 18F-Fluorodopa (18F-FDOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed asymmetrically decreased 18F-FDOPA uptake in both putamens. The motor symptoms were improved after treatment with pramipexole and biperiden [29].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 infection is considered responsible for the development of parkinsonism. However, the mechanism by which COVID-19 triggers neurodegeneration remains to be determined. Some evidence has suggested the causal link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and parkinsonism [30, 31]. Infection of dopaminergic neurons with the H1N1 influenza virus results in the aggregation of α-synuclein, which is the major protein component of Lewy bodies in the brain [32]. In animal models, viral infections can trigger α-synucleinopathies [33]. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is able to enter the brain and trigger the release of inflammatory mediators [34] that are known to play a role in neurodegeneration. SARS-CoV-2 can enter the brain by invading the olfactory bulb, by axonal transport from peripheral nerves, and by hematogenous pathways through the BBB [35]. SARS-CoV-2 could bind to ACE2 receptors on dopaminergic neurons, altering the rate of accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein, and promoting mitochondria stress, autophagy, and apoptosis [35, 36]. Apart from the direct invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS, post-infection immune-mediated process also plays an important role in the development of PD [37]. Systemic effects such as vascular insults in the nigrostriatal system could lead to subsequent parkinsonism [38]. Furthermore, the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-19 infection could trigger neuroinflammation and result in neurodegeneration [39].",
            "A meta-analysis has found that patients with neurological disorders have a doubled risk of COVID-19 and a 40% higher risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 [40]. Furthermore, a cohort study has focused on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and hospitalization for COVID-19 in PD patients during a 15-month period of the COVID-19 pandemic [12]. The study revealed a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in PD patients (hazard ratio [HR], 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04–1.7) compared to matched controls. Adjusted HR of hospitalization for COVID-19 was 1.1 (95% CI 0.8–1.7) in PD [12]. Antonini et al. analyzed the outcomes of 10 PD patients infected with COVID-19 and concluded that PD patients of older age with longer disease duration are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 with a substantially high mortality rate (40%) [41]. Studies have suggested that PD patients may have an increased risk of COVID-19, mainly due to the fact that PD mostly affects elderly people with numerous comorbidities and multidrug therapies [42]. Moreover, respiratory muscle rigidity, impairment of cough reflex, and dyspnea are very common during the course of PD, possibly causing a more severe infection of COVID-19 and an increased risk of hospitalization in PD [41, 42].",
            "Nevertheless, there are also some opposite results. Jon Stoessl et al. mentioned in a recent editorial that there was no evidence that patients with movement disorders were at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, compared to individuals with similar age and comorbidities [43]. In a single-center case–control survey of 105 PD patients and 92 controls identified as COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 risk and mortality in PD patients did not differ from the general population [26]. Fasano et al. reported that COVID-19 risk, morbidity, and mortality in patients with mild to moderate PD do not differ from the general population [26]. This discrepancy may be caused by differences in enrollment and screening criteria for participants. More studies with larger sample sizes at different stages of PD across different centers are needed to clarify whether PD increases the risk of COVID-19 infection.",
            "A nationwide cross-sectional study of 5,210,432 inpatients from 1468 hospitals in Germany has collected data from 64,434 PD patients, with 693 being COVID-19-positive [44]. The COVID-19-positive inpatients with PD showed higher incidence of comorbidities than non-PD COVID-19-positive subjects, particularly hypertension and chronic kidney disease [44]. In addition, the COVID-19 inpatient mortality rate was much higher in PD patients than in non-PD patients (35.4% vs 20.7%, P < 0.001), especially in patients aged 75–79 years [44]. In addition, a meta-analysis of 12 studies with 103,874 COVID-19 patients showed that PD is associated with an enhanced risk of disease severity (odds ratio [OR], 2.61; 95% CI 1.98–3.43) and mortality (relative risk [RR], 2.63; 95% CI 1.50–4.60) from COVID-19 [45]. Furthermore, a cohort study included 1294 Dutch residents with COVID-19 and 17,999 residents without COVID-19 identified risk factors for 30-day mortality for COVID-19 [46]. For residents with COVID-19, being male (HR, 1.8), having dementia (HR, 1.3), and having PD (HR, 1.7) are all associated with higher 30-day mortality [46]. Being male is also associated with higher mortality (HR, 1.7) in the controls, whereas having dementia and having PD are not. Therefore, having dementia and having PD are recognized as unique risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 patients [46].",
            "However, inconsistent results have also been reported. A cohort study by Vignatelli and colleagues assessed the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 and death in 696 PD patients compared with 8590 controls. The 3-month hospitalization rate for COVID-19 was 0.6% in PD and 0.7% in controls. The 30-day risk of death after hospitalization was high in both cohorts (around 35%) without a difference between the two groups [47]. A meta-analysis of 13 studies found that the prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with PD is comparable to that in patients without PD [48]. The prognosis for COVID-19 varies extremely and is affected by many factors, such as the COVID-19 infection ascertainment method, age, geographical context, and capacity of the healthcare system. It was hard to compare the different studies since adjustment for age and other baseline demographics, such as the history of drug administration, was not approached in the study. The prognosis of COVID-19 in PD patients should be further confirmed in larger population-based cohorts with adjustment of interfering factors.",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the delivery of in-person medical care for PD patients. Digital rehabilitation strategies including virtual rehabilitation platforms as an alternative to deliver rehabilitation services at the community level should be encouraged [49]. Although telemedicine services are not superior to the in-person visits in providing care, a growing body of evidence suggests that it offers greater efficiency and service for PD patients [50]. An online survey in Italy has investigated the impact of COVID-19 on access to telehealth care among 197 PD patients and 42 neurologists [51]. The results showed that 37.6% of PD patients and 88.1% of neurologists had chosen alternatives to in-person visits, while 13.7% of PD patients and 40.5% of neurologists used telemedicine. Most of them were satisfied with the use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating that telemedicine has the potential to improve the care for PD patients, especially when access to in-person visits is limited [51]. Another survey of 417 PD patients in Canada aiming to see the effects of confinement on patients’ daily living and disease management suggested that COVID-19-related confinement affected PD manifestation and management [52], and the patients reported varying levels of interest in continuing remote care via phone or video conference [52].",
            "The online dancing program is one option for telemedical care. Morris et al. conducted an observational study in Australia to evaluate the impact of online therapeutic dancing classes in early- to mid-stage PD patients. Thirteen participants completed 8 one-hour sessions of online therapeutic dancing and were able to quickly adapt to online delivery with support and resources. This study showed that online dance therapy is safe and beneficial to early adopters during the pandemic [53]. Another online survey explored the accessibility and benefit of home-based dance programs for PD patients. Data from 276 individuals with PD showed that 94.9% of participants benefited from home-based dance programs, including improvements in physical (balance and posture) and non-physical (mood and confidence) aspects. A great portion (70.8%) of the participants expressed strong preference for continuing with home-based practice in the future. These results indicated that at-home dance is accessible and beneficial for PD patients, and digital dance programs are potential therapies for PD [54].",
            "Moreover, for PD patients who have received deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy, remote programming greatly facilitates on-time follow-up and timely programming, which are important for high-quality management of PD. With the use of internet technologies, Xu et al. continued to provide motor and non-motor symptom assessment and remote programming services for 36 postsurgical DBS patients during the COVID-19 pandemic [55]. The patients showed significant improvements in UPDRS-III score and most of them were willing to use remote programming again [55]. Thus, remote programming based on online evaluation of symptoms is critical for postsurgical management of DBS patients with PD during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "In the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine that offers digital visits, e-rehabilitation and remote programming can break the obstacles of limited access to routine-visits in hospitals.",
            "Importantly, a number of anti-PD medications might have potential benefits against SARS-CoV-2. The PD medication amantadine is also approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a therapy against the influenza A virus, and its antiviral properties make it a potential treatment for COVID-19 [56]. A small number of COVID-19-positive PD patients taking amantadine did not manifest symptoms of COVID-19 [42] and another case report has demonstrated similar results [57]. A hospital-based, observational, retrospective cohort study collected data from 256 PD patients (including 87 patients taking amantadine and 169 patients without amantadine) by an online questionnaire survey [58], and found that the rate of COVID-19 disease was 5.7% in patients taking amantadine and 11.8% in patients without amantadine [58]. Amantadine is also associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 infection (OR, 0.26; 95% CI 0.07–0.89) [58]. It is hypothesized that amantadine may target SARS-CoV-2 by disrupting lysosomal gene expression [59]. Therefore, amantadine may be potentially used for the prevention of COVID-19.",
            "Other anti-PD medications, such as levodopa, may have an impact on SARS-CoV-2 since alterations of the dopamine synthetic pathway are considered to be involved in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 [60]. Use of dopamine agonists has been found to be associated with worse outcomes of patients with COVID-19 infection [26, 61]. In addition, in an interactome analysis of potential drugs repurposed for SARS-CoV-2, entacapone was identified as a potential drug [62]. Clozapine is frequently used and recommended to manage psychosis or dyskinesia in PD. In a study of 6309 participants including 102 persons positive with COVID-19, clozapine treatment was linked with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection compared with other antipsychotics [63].",
            "Interestingly, vitamin D supplementation was identified as a protective factor against COVID-19 infection in PD patients (OR, 0.50; 95% CI 0.30–0.83) [64]. Regular vitamin D3 consumption of 2000–5000 IU/day may reduce the risk and severity of COVID-19 in PD patients [65]. Vitamin D plays a protective role in the development and progression of PD, in addition to its potent antiviral effects [66]. PD patients usually have decreased levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 compared to controls, and low concentrations of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 are linked to higher incidence and greater severity of the COVID-19 disease [66]. Administration of vitamin D3 significantly improves the motor and non-motor manifestations of PD [67]. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to complications in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and PD, while supplementation of vitamin D3 in PD patients can help minimize the risk and burden of COVID-19 complications [67]. Vitamin D may directly down-regulate the ACE2 receptor, the major receptor for viral entry, thereby lowering the probability of COVID-19 infection [68].",
            "The approved mRNA-based vaccines and viral vector vaccines under development are known or expected not to interact with the neurodegenerative process in PD [69]. Types or incidence of side effects of these vaccines in PD showed no difference from the general population [69]. The vaccines also seem to be safe for older adults, but cautions are needed for the specific subgroup of very frail and terminally ill elderly persons with PD living in long-term care facilities [69]. Erro et al. reported 2 PD patients who developed severe dyskinesia after receiving the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) mRNA vaccine [70]. The reasons were not clear, but systemic inflammatory response may be a trigger. Innate immune response following mRNA vaccination is critical for the initiation of adaptive immunity. This highlights the variability of response triggered by the vaccine that depends on individual immunological profiles [70]. Imbalzano et al. [71] also observed 2 PD patients who showed worsening of parkinsonian symptoms after receiving the third vaccine dose (mRNA-1273 booster). The two patients and other cases of vaccine-related movement disorder completely recovered after a few days with parkinsonian therapy modifications, symptomatic treatment, or even spontaneously [71]. Conversely, Contaldi et al. described a 55-year-old PD patient who benefited from administration of the mRNA-1273 vaccine [72]. Right after the first shot, the patient reported global improvement in motor and non-motor symptoms and a sustained benefit for almost one week after the second shot [72]. However, the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects are not easy to clarify. Taken together, COVID-19 vaccination with approved vaccines for persons with PD is recommended, unless there is a specific contraindication [69].",
            "One more thing that needs caution for amantadine is the hypothesized potential interference with COVID-19 vaccines [73]. For influenza A, the mechanisms of action of amantadine are considered to be related to the interference with the endosome, thus interrupting the release of virions into the cell [56]. While current COVID-19 mRNA vaccines use lipid nanoparticles as critical components for transporting mRNA into host cells, cautions should be paid to the lipophilic properties of amantadine and its ability to interrupt the endosome, which may interfere with the release of the mRNA into the cell matrix and subsequently with its binding to ribosomes [56, 74]. As more people are going to be vaccinated and more similar vaccines are going to be introduced, for PD patients treated with amantadine, vaccination approach should be selected with caution.",
            "It is already known that SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through the cellular surface protein ACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) [75]. Dopaminergic neurons are considered to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection since both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors are overexpressed in the substantia nigra [76, 77]. Under certain pathological circumstances, SARS-CoV-2 acts as a neurodegenerative enhancer to potentially drive the development or progression of PD and its related motor and non-motor symptoms [35, 78]. In direct pathways, SARS-CoV-2 enters the CNS through the olfactory nerve via axonal transport from peripheral nerves, or through the BBB [79]. COVID-19 infection may increase cytokine production, leading to the activation of microglial cells, increasing T-cell activation-related immunity, and increasing neuroinflammation [38, 80, 81]. SARS-CoV-2 could bind to ACE2 receptors on dopaminergic neurons, which might alter the rate of accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein, induce mitochondria stress, affect autophagy and promote apoptosis [82, 83]. In indirect pathways, SARS-CoV-2 could lead to neurodegeneration via systemic effects. Systemic inflammation and sepsis would promote a hypercoagulable response to form clots in brain vessels, and cytokine storms could lead to hyper-inflammation and neuroinflammation [38, 84, 85] (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Putative mechanisms of the link between COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease (PD). With the aid of TMPRSS2, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds with ACE2 to enter the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 virus may affect the midbrain in the following ways: vascular damage (BBB breakdown), systemic inflammation, and direct neuroinvasion, which then induce neuroinflammation, excessive oxidative stress, abnormal immune response, and aggregation of α-synuclein, leading to dopaminergic neuronal death and PD. ACE2: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; α-syn: a-synuclein; BBB: blood–brain barrier; COVID-19: Coronavirus disease 2019; NRP1: neuropilin 1; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; TMPRSS2: transmembrane serine protease 2",

            "COVID-19 infection may increase cytokine production leading to the activation of microglial cells, increasing T-cell activation-related immunity, and increasing neuroinflammation [38, 80, 81]. A neuropathological study of 43 COVID-19 patients revealed microglial activation and invasion of cytotoxic T cells in the brainstem, which are also neuropathological signs associated with PD [86]. Microglial cells are the major resident innate immune inflammatory cells in the brain and can produce proinflammatory cytokines upon activation. Activation of microglial nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a critical role in dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the mouse model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine [87]. Activation of the inflammasome is not exclusively a brain event. Systemic activation of the inflammasome is likely to be involved in the formation of severe cytokine storms, which are capable of disrupting the BBB, and inducing microglial activation and neuroinflammation. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a transcription factor that increases the expression of a number of antioxidant proteins and suppresses the NLRP3 inflammasome [88, 89]. NRF2 activation may be a potential therapeutic approach to counteracting the NLRP3 inflammasome, which can be used for PD and COVID-19 by simultaneously reducing neuroinflammation and systemic inflammation [90].",
            "Oxidative stress is a crucial mechanism related to both the cause and the progression of PD [91, 92]. Oxidative stress generates reactive oxidative species (ROS) and leads to the apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons through activation of caspases and nuclear factor κB signaling [91, 92]. Oxidative stress has also been linked to other processes involved in dopaminergic neuron degeneration, including mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and excitotoxicity [91, 92]. COVID-19 is responsible for severe acute respiratory insufficiency, subsequent hypoxemia, sepsis-induced hyper-coagulation, local thrombosis in brain vessels with hypoperfusion, and cerebral hypoxia. COVID-19 might exacerbate oxidative stress dysregulation at the cellular level and promote neurodegeneration [78]. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptors on microglia decreases mitochondria energy and activates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, which generates ROS, promoting oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, leading to apoptosis of neighboring dopaminergic neurons [93–95].",
            "Immune cell circulation to the CNS is restricted to particular immune subsets (innate and adaptive immune cell subsets), which can take charge of the immune control in the CNS [96]. Upon viral infection, the level of immune cell migration is increased. In PD patients, immune changes occur not only in the brain, involving microglia, but also in the periphery, with changes in the innate immunity such as monocytes and the adaptive immune system, particularly T-cells [97]. The pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cells secret pro-inflammatory cytokines to activate M1 microglia, resulting in sustained neuroinflammation [97, 98]. Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, together with activated astrocytes, acts as a link between SARS-CoV-2 and PD pathogenesis [99].",
            "The hallmark of the neurodegenerative process in PD is represented by pathological accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) protein, leading to formation of Lewy bodies. This protein aggregation spreads from neuron to neuron, disrupting dopaminergic transmission and function, eventually leading to neuronal death [100]. Neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 could lead to elevation of α-syn level. The aggregation of α-syn is accelerated upon the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) in a test tube in vitro, suggesting a potential link between SARS-CoV-2 and α-syn that influences PD pathology [101]. Meanwhile, excessive oxidative stress correlated with SARS-CoV-2 infection can also promote the pathological aggregation of α-syn, leading to dopaminergic neurotoxicity and PD [102].",

            "Recent studies have revealed pronounced systemic inflammation and cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 [103]. Accumulating evidence from post-mortem studies suggests that COVID-19-related neuropathological alterations are most likely to be immune-mediated [86, 104–106]. Severe COVID-19 and prolonged hypoxia would exacerbate the severity of pre-existing cognitive impairment of AD. This further affects the quality of life of AD patients. A most recent case report also suggested that pre-symptomatic people without a diagnosis of AD experience an acceleration of cognitive decline due to prolonged hypoxia related to COVID-19 [107].",
            "Furthermore, previous experimental data suggested that isolation aggravates cognitive impairment in AD animal models [108–110]. Thus, it raised the question of whether restriction measures implemented to limit the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic would exacerbate the cognitive deficits of AD patients. Barguilla et al. found that 60% of AD patients suffered from cognitive decline during 2 months of lockdown [6]. Similarly, a nationwide survey in Italy interviewing caregivers of 4913 patients with dementia reported acute worsening of cognitive functions in 55.1% of patients during COVID-19 quarantine, mainly in subjects with AD and dementia with Lewy bodies [111]. Interestingly, pre-existing physical independence in motor function was associated with cognitive worsening (OR, 1.85; 95% CI 1.42–2.39), whereas pandemic awareness was a protective factor against worsening of cognitive symptoms (OR, 0.74; 95% CI 0.65–0.85). In addition, a study in France showed that worsened cognitive function was only present in AD patients who had definite neuropsychiatric changes during a period of 2-month isolation, accounting for 26% of the patients [5]. These observations support that the COVID-19 pandemic exerts a negative impact on the cognitive function of AD.",
            "Neuropsychiatric manifestations are a common feature in dementia patients, affecting 80% of patients over the course of the disease. Accumulating evidence shows that 36%–78% of individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 display neurological symptoms including neuropsychiatric manifestations [112]. On the other hand, it is also reported that neuropsychiatric symptoms may emerge as the initial presentation of COVID-19 in subjects with dementia. Bianchetti et al. summarized the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in dementia patients [113]. Among 82 patients diagnosed with dementia, the most common initial symptoms of COVID-19 were delirium (67%) and worsening of the functional status (56.1%). On the contrary, typical symptoms of COVID-19, including fever (47.6%), dyspnea (43.6%), and cough (13.4%), were less common in dementia patients [113]. It is worth noting that as many as 50% of the delirium symptoms manifest in the hypoactive form. These results suggested that the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in patients with dementia is atypical, and SARS-CoV-2 infection could be considered in the presence of manifestation and/or exacerbation of neuropsychiatric symptoms during this pandemic. Early recognition and treatment are important for preventing development of severe consequences of COVID-19 in dementia patients.",
            "Neuropsychiatric symptoms tend to deteriorate under external stressors. Numerous cross-sectional studies in different countries have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and social-distancing measures on neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD. They consistently demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions lead to the worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD patients [5, 7, 114, 115], with most pronounced neuropsychiatric symptoms being agitation, anxiety, and depression. The worsening of irritability, sleep disturbance, apathy, aberrant motor activity, appetite disturbances, and delusion were also reported in some of these studies. Bretonniere et al. found that the duration of confinement and increased stress of caregivers significantly correlate with the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms [5]. Besides, limited understanding of the COVID-19 situation and lack of outpatient rehabilitation services are also associated with a deterioration of neuropsychiatric symptoms [114, 116]. Apart from the aforementioned studies completed after 1–2 months of COVID-19 lockdown, Chen et al. reported a longitudinal 1-year follow-up study comparing cognitive function of AD patients before and after COVID-19 lockdown to determine the long-term impact of confinement on AD patients. They found significantly worsening of neuropsychiatric inventory at 1-year follow-up compared to baseline, and neuropsychiatric symptoms deteriorated in 43.8% of AD patients. Regression analysis implicated that the decline of social contact and sleep disturbance at baseline contributed to the worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD patients [7]. Muntsant et al. examined the impact of long-term isolation in male 3×Tg-AD mice that model advanced stages of AD, compared to age-matched counterparts with normal aging [117]. The isolated 3×Tg-AD mice displayed exacerbated hyperactivity, emergence of bizarre behaviors, and re-structured anxiety-like patterns and coping-with-stress strategies. This study further confirmed that social isolation exacerbates neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD.",
            "Taken together, the worsening of neuropsychiatric disturbances in AD is not only a direct result from SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also secondary to pandemic-related socioeconomic changes.",
            "Unlike consistent deterioration of neuropsychiatric symptoms in different reports, there is no consensus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions on dementia progression in AD patients. Gan et al. completed a longitudinal follow-up study in 131 AD patients experiencing confinement for a mean duration of 8.89 months to determine the impact of implemented restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic in AD patients [118]. They found that over 50% of these patients presented significant cognitive decline at an average of 14.07-month follow-up compared to baseline, as assessed by the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). However, the extent of cognitive decline of these participants was similar to that of strictly matched 131 AD patients as controls, who were followed up before the COVID-19 pandemic. These results suggested that cognitive decline during the pandemic in AD patients resulted from the intrinsic neurodegenerative process rather than the confinement. These data are consistent with another longitudinal 1-year follow-up study [7], which reported that the decline of MMSE scores in AD patients during the pandemic was similar to the rate of yearly decline in previous studies before the pandemic [7]. On the contrary, Tsiakiri et al. longitudinally assessed the cognitive performance of 21 AD patients during 7-month follow-up that corresponded to the strict lockdown period in Greece [115]. They found significantly greater worsening of MMSE and MoCA scores in AD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown compared to the AD controls who completed follow-up before the lockdown. This suggested that COVID-19 pandemic aggravates the rate of cognitive decline in AD. Therefore, longer follow-up is crucial to evaluate the direct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the progression of AD. Animal model studies can provide hints and evidence for potential mechanisms underlying isolation and AD. Previous studies in Tg2576, APP/PS1, and 5×FAD transgenic mice have reported that isolation leads to acceleration of AD pathology manifested as an increase in amyloid-β disposition in the brain [108–110]. A recent study reported hippocampal atrophy and left–right asymmetry in isolated male 3×Tg-AD mice compared to age-matched counterparts with normal aging, although there was no exacerbation of tau pathology in the hippocampus [117]. Unfortunately, there is no longitudinal amyloid-related imaging or cerebral glucose metabolism imaging study in patients with AD to assess whether COVID-19 aggravates the amyloid burden in the brain. From the translational perspective, it is of great importance in the future to longitudinally follow up neuropsychological and neuroimaging performance in community-based AD cohorts to determine the long-term effect of COVID-19 and related restrictions on dementia progression and AD-related mortality.",
            "Neurological symptoms including memory loss are reported in up to 30% of COVID-19 cases [112, 119]. Several structural neurologic abnormalities can persist for a long time after acute COVID-19 infection, which is part of the long COVID spectrum [120–122]. A recent international cohort study revealed that over 70% of COVID-19 patients experienced cognitive dysfunction and about 30% of COVID-19 patients have long-term memory issues at 7 months after infection [121]. It has been proven that SARS-CoV-2 infection not only induces innate and adaptive immune activation in multiple peripheral organs but also disrupts the BBB and alters the inflammatory factor profile of the brain [86, 103, 123]. Brain autopsies on COVID-19 patients have shown sparse SARS-CoV-2 virus in cortical neurons, accompanied by infiltration of minimal immune cells [106]. In line with this observation, an experimental study ascertained that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces neuronal death in mice overexpressing human ACE2 receptors [106]. Strikingly, the latest breakthrough came from the study by Charnley and colleagues, which identified two short peptides from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome that self-assemble into amyloid assemblies [124]. Furthermore, these protease-resistant amyloids were shown to be highly toxic to neuronal cells, which shared similarities to the toxic amyloid-β in AD. These findings raise the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce long-term neurodegeneration. Data from brain lysates of COVID-19 patients revealed activation of tau hyperphosphorylation-associated signaling pathways, suggesting that AD-like features are involved in COVID-19 neuropathology [125]. Serum neurodegenerative biomarkers (total tau, phosphorylated tau-181, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light chain) from hospitalized COVID-19 patients without dementia are elevated to levels observed in AD, and are associated with encephalopathy and worse outcomes [126]. Another recent study has shown that elevated concentrations of neuroaxonal damage markers (14-3-3 protein and neurofilament light chain) in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) could predict the severity of neurologic disability at 18 months of follow-up [127]. These lines of evidence support the role of SARS-CoV-2 infection in triggering future AD dementia.",
            "Most recent metabolic brain imaging studies showed that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection could induce hypometabolism of a widespread cerebral network including the frontoparietal and temporal cortex, insula, and basal ganglia. At the 6-month follow-up, however, brain hypometabolism had partially or totally recovered, although several attention deficits and executive dysfunctions but not memory problems remained [104, 128, 129]. Considering the relatively small sample size and short follow-up, these results should be interpreted with caution. Strikingly, Douaud and colleagues reported the first and largest longitudinal imaging study comparing brain MRI scans of 401 individuals before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection to scans of 384 well-matched controls [130]. The average interval between their COVID-19 diagnosis and the second scan was 141 days. Compared to the control group, the SARS-CoV-2-positive participants showed a greater reduction of grey matter thickness and tissue-contrast in the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus and greater changes in markers of tissue damage in regions functionally connected to the primary olfactory cortex. These results revealed a consistent spatial pattern of longitudinal abnormalities in limbic brain regions, which are the main part of the olfactory network, following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2-positive participants showed a greater reduction of global brain size and significant worsening of executive function measured by the Trail Making Test. However, neither signs of memory impairment when comparing the two groups, nor any association of the parahippocampal gyrus and other memory-related regions with the selected cognitive tests was detected. It remains to be determined whether the loss of grey matter and tissue damage of those specific limbic regions may in turn increase the risk of memory deficits and dementia in the longer term. More recently, Xu and colleagues estimated the risks and burdens of incident neurologic disorders at 12 months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large-scale cohort that included 154,068 individuals with COVID-19 [131]. Increased risks of memory problems (HR, 1.77; 95% CI 1.68–1.85) and AD (HR, 2.03; 95% CI 1.79–2.31) were shown at 12 months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. It should be mentioned that the abovementioned data were acquired before the Omicron variant has become dominant in most countries. Recent evidence suggests attenuated pathogenicity of the Omicron variant in comparison to the wild-type strain and the Alpha, Beta and Delta variants [132–135]. Accordingly, the latest report from the UK COVID Symptom Study also confirmed a reduced odds of long COVID symptoms between 0.24 and 0.50 for the Omicron variants compared with the Delta variants [136]. Thus, different SARS-CoV-2 variants may be associated with different risks of developing AD. It is also the case for patients vaccinated or not. The clinical impacts of different SARS-CoV-2 variants on triggering of AD have not been clarified.",
            "In addition to the possible direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the development of dementia, previous studies suggested that social isolation and loneliness are related to cognitive decline and the risk of future dementia [137]. In particular, a recent study by Shen and colleagues utilizing a UK-Biobank cohort of 462,619 participants with a mean follow-up period of 11.7 years indicated that social isolation is associated with a 1.26-fold increase of risk of developing dementia, which is independent of loneliness and other risk factors [138]. Furthermore, structural MRI and transcriptomic data illustrated that socially isolated individuals have lower gray matter volumes in temporal, frontal, and hippocampal regions coupled with different molecular functions. These findings have clinical implications in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that quarantine for the COVID-19 pandemic may exert a pernicious effect on cognition later in life. Thus, social relationship interventions should be targeted to alleviate the long-term impact of both social isolation and loneliness on cognitive outcomes.",
            "The longer-term effect of COVID-19 infection and related quarantine on the risk of developing AD will be one of the priority areas for future research. Longitudinal studies of brain structure and function with longer follow-up intervals are warranted, and will provide guidance for care strategies after acute COVID-19 and public health policies.",
            "There is growing evidence supporting that AD patients are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection. A retrospective case–control analysis of 61.9 million adult and senior COVID-19 patients in the US before August 21, 2020 unraveled that AD patients had a higher risk of COVID-19 compared to patients without dementia (adjusted OR, 1.86; 95% CI 1.77–1.96) [139]. Interestingly, the study also revealed that Blacks with dementia had a higher risk of COVID-19 than Whites (adjusted OR, 2.86; 95% CI 2.67–3.06). More recently, another large-scale study including 436,823 subjects (≥ 50 years old and < 90 years old) from the US has also shown that patients with AD are associated with higher odds of being diagnosed with COVID-19 than patients without AD (OR, 1.688; 95% CI 1.558–1.828) [140]. In accordance with these observations in the US, data from the UK Biobank cohort revealed that a diagnosis of AD is strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, with AD patients showing greater susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infectivity compared to individuals without AD (OR, 4.15; 95% CI 3.22–5.34) [141]. However, nationwide data from Korea reported that the positive rate of COVID-19 testing did not differ between individuals with and without AD, raising doubts on the association of AD with increased susceptibility to COVID-19 [142]. Further investigations from more countries are needed to clarify the issue. In addition to the intrinsic link between AD and COVID-19, socioeconomic factors should not be underestimated in explaining the possible increased risk of COVID-19 in AD patients. Cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms make it challenging for AD patients to understand and comply with safeguarding procedures, such as wearing masks and maintaining appropriate physical distancing. Ignoring or forgetting warnings and an inability to follow self-quarantine measures also increase the risk of infection [143]. Furthermore, most of the individuals with AD live in institutional settings (nursing or care homes), where rates of infection are disproportionately high. This situation facilitates rapid transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and increases the risk of infection among AD patients. In summary, biological and socioeconomic factors work together to make individuals with AD vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "To date, it has become clear that AD is a strong risk factor for increased mortality of COVID-19. Bianchetti et al. assessed COVID-19-related mortality in dementia among 627 subjects hospitalized for COVID-19 [113]. They found a significantly higher mortality in patients with dementia compared to those without dementia (62.5% vs 26.2%). Regression analysis revealed that dementia is an independent risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality with an OR of 1.84 (95% CI 1.09–3.13). Covino et al. reported risk factors for COVID-19-related mortality in 69 symptomatic COVID-19 patients aged ≥ 80 years [144]. Interestingly, in this population with advanced age, the risk of death was not age-dependent whereas severe dementia was an independent risk factor for death (OR, 3.87; 95% CI 1.23–12.17). These data indicate that the pre-existing dementia exacerbates the severity and mortality of COVID-19. More recently, a retrospective study including 61.9 million adult and senior COVID-19 patients from the US reported that the 6-month hospitalization risk for adult and senior patients with AD and COVID-19 (61.54%) was significantly higher than that for adult and senior patients with COVID-19 but without dementia (23.26%) or with AD but without COVID-19 (13.80%) [139]. Additionally, the 6-month mortality risk for adult and senior patients with AD and COVID-19 (19.23%) was significantly higher than that for adult and senior patients with COVID-19 but without dementia (4.81%) or with AD but without COVID-19 (9.71%). Consistently, latest analysis of a national healthcare database in the US has shown that patients with AD have increased odds of hospitalization (OR, 1.428; 95% CI 1.139–1.791) and death (OR, 1.695; 95% CI 1.383–2.078) compared to patients without AD [140]. Similarly, two large-scale UK Biobank cohort studies consistently identified pre-existing dementia as the highest risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality [14, 141]. Subgroup analysis from one of the studies revealed that diagnoses of AD predict an increased risk of COVID-19 death with an odds ratio of 4.17 (95% CI 2.87–6.05) [141]. In line with these results, another nationwide cohort study from Korea reported that AD is associated with both an increased risk of severe COVID-19 complications (OR, 2.25; 95% CI 1.54–3.28) and an increased risk of mortality (OR, 3.09; 95% CI 2.00–4.78) [142]. Additionally, a systematic review of 9 studies has shown that the mortality rate of individuals with dementia after being infected with COVID-19 is higher than that of those without dementia (OR, 5.17; 95% CI 2.31–11.59) [145]. Taken together, a diagnosis of AD is undoubtfully associated with increased mortality of COVID-19. Close and tailored monitoring of patients with AD is needed to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on this frail population.",
            "Several studies have explored the risk factors for the occurrence and severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in dementia patients. In a systematic review of 10 studies, the association between dementia and mortality of COVID-19 is influenced by age and hypertension [146]. Additionally, a considerable body of evidence indicates that APOE ε4 allele, a well-known AD risk factor, increases the risk of severity and mortality of COVID-19, independent of pre-existing dementia, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes [147–149]. In the UK Biobank community cohort study, the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization was more than two-fold higher among APOE ε4/ε4 homozygotes compared to ε3/ε3 homozygotes [149]. Similarly, homozygous APOE ε4/ε4 patients exhibit a more than two-fold increased hazard ratio for death relative to APOE ε3/ε3 homozygous patients [148]. Strikingly, oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), a newly reported risk gene for AD, was recently identified as a putative risk gene associated with severe COVID-19 in intensive care patients in human genome-wide association studies [150, 151]. These findings suggest the importance of investigating molecular pathways involved in the link between AD and severe COVID-19 infection, as well as understanding the risk factors associated with AD to reduce the occurrence and severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19.",
            "The isolation and quarantine measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have a profound impact on the management strategies for AD. Telemedicine services have been advocated and developed rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several studies before the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated comparable accuracy and reliability of diagnosis and monitoring, as well as comparable visit satisfactions between telemedicine services and face-to-face clinical evaluation [152, 153]. Moreover, studies have revealed a similar effect on the annual changes of MMSE scores between patients using the telemedicine services and patients attending the dementia clinic in person [154]. Strikingly, a large-scale randomized trial found that providing care monthly to patients with dementia and caregivers via telephone and Internet improved patient’s quality of life after 12 months in comparison to standard care [155]. In the context of COVID-19, telemedicine and digital devices, including telephones and video conferences, also benefit remote monitoring and management of patients with dementia [156–164]. As mentioned above, restriction measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have a detrimental impact on neuropsychiatric symptoms. Telemedicine decreases the frequency and intensity of neuropsychiatric symptoms, as well as improving the caregiver's well-being and mental health in a systematic review of 22 studies [165]. Tele-rehabilitation platforms for neurorehabilitation care (e.g., fitness training and cognitive training) with remote supervision have a positive effect on patients and reduces the burden on family caregivers [166–168]. However, barriers still exist in the practice of telemedicine services, such as issues of patient privacy, confidentiality and security of information, limitations in clinical data acquisition, lack of technological literacy, and connectivity problems [153, 162, 163, 169]. Most patients with AD are older adults who may have greater difficulty accessing technological devices or Internet services. Therefore, support from caregivers to facilitate the virtual visit is essential to the success of direct-to-home care for dementia [170]. Although telemedicine services are feasible and well accepted in assessing and managing AD, whether they could improve clinical outcomes in patients with AD remains to be clarified.",
            "Cholinesterase inhibitors increase the availability of acetylcholine at synapses in the brain and are one of the few drug therapies that have been proven clinically useful in the treatment of AD. Currently available FDA-approved cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of AD are donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine. On the other hand, it is hypothesized that dysfunctions of the nicotinic cholinergic system may be involved in severe COVID-19, which contribute to uncontrolled cytokine storm [171]. Acetylcholine stimulation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR) on peripheral macrophages has been proven to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion [172]. Treatment strategies targeting the cholinergic system are proposed to induce symptomatic improvement in both AD and COVID-19. However, no studies have reported if cholinesterase inhibitor therapies could reduce the infection rate and mortality of COVID-19.",
            "Hypertension is a common comorbidity and risk factor for both AD and COVID-19. Accumulating evidence has indicated the beneficial effects of long-term use of antihypertension medications on decreasing the risk of developing AD, including angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) [173, 174]. By retrospective analysis of 436,823 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, Wang and colleagues found that prescribing ARBs but not ACEIs is significantly associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 occurrence among AD patients [140]. Dysregulation of calcium ion (Ca2+) hemostasis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Calcium channel blocker (CCB) nimodipine is a treatment choice for AD. Based on the fact that Ca2+ is associated with SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into host cells and the inhibitory effect of CCBs on infections of several other viruses, CCBs are postulated as a potential therapeutic strategy for the management of COVID-19 [175, 176]. Unfortunately, it is still controversial whether the use of CCBs could improve the outcomes of COVID-19 in clinical practice. In a large cohort study including 64,781 patients with COVID-19 in the US, Rosenthal et al. found that the use of CCB is independently associated with decreased in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.73; 95% CI 0.68–0.79) [177]. However, several large-scale retrospective studies have implicated that CCBs are not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or severity [178–180]. A meta-analysis study including 31 studies also indicated no influence of CCBs on reduced mortality of COVID-19 (OR, 1.21; 95% CI 0.98–1.49), whereas subgroup analysis showed that CCBs are associated with a decreased mortality in hypertensive COVID-19 patients (OR, 0.69; 95% CI 0.52–0.91) [181]. In the latest cohort study including 245 hospitalized patients with hypertensive COVID-19, however, Mendez and colleagues found that dihydropyridine CCBs increase the risk of COVID-19-related intubation or death compared to patients not taking dihydropyridine CCBs [182]. Therefore, prospective randomized trials are required to explore potential effective treatments for both AD and COVID-19.",
            "Vaccination is now regarded as the most effective countermeasure to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Large-scale worldwide COVID-19 vaccination programs are being rapidly implemented, whereas vaccinated AD patients are still at increased risk for COVID-19 breakthrough infection. A retrospective cohort study of 262,847 vaccinated older adults in the US has shown that the overall risk of breakthrough infections beginning 14 days following vaccination in AD was significantly higher than that in older adults without dementia between December 2020 and August 2021 (10.3% vs 5.6%; adjusted OR, 1.53; 95% CI 1.22–1.92) [183]. The overall risk for hospitalization after breakthrough infections was 39.5% in AD patients in contrast to 1.5% in AD patients who had no breakthrough infections (HR, 54.1; 95% CI 34.0–86.0). Interestingly, fully vaccinated women with AD had a lower risk of breakthrough infections than men after matching for demographic factors and comorbidities (adjusted OR, 0.68; 95% CI 0.47–0.98) [183]. Thus, it is of great necessity to continuously monitor breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections and outcomes in vaccinated patients with AD. Meanwhile, post-vaccination adverse events have been reported. A patient with AD was reported to manifest delirium following the first dose of vaccination with an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine [184]. This suggests that individuals with AD may be vulnerable to delirium after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. 18F-Florbetaben PET scan in a patient diagnosed with AD demonstrated ill-defined subcutaneous uptake on the vaccination site and focal uptake next to an ipsilateral axillary lymph node after administration of the first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. This suggests possible accelerated amyloid-β deposition induced by low-level inflammation after COVID-19 vaccination in AD patients [185]. However, whether COVID-19 vaccination exacerbates amyloid-β immune reactivity in the brain is still unknown and needs to be clarified in the future.",
            "Recently, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) have been identified as a rare adverse effect of adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccines with an incidence rate of 1.33% (95% CI 1.19 to 1.47 at 8–14 days) [186]. A prospective, hospital-based study by Sue and colleagues showed that VITT usually develops between 5 and 48 days after the first dose of the vaccine with an overall mortality rate of 22% [187]. Palaiodimou and colleagues reported that 51% of patients with VITT present with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) (95% CI 36%–66%) [188]. VITT is independently associated with a higher risk of CVST when compared to patients without VITT with thrombotic events after vaccination (OR, 13.8; 95% CI 2.0–97.3). Intracranial hemorrhage is a common presentation in patients with postvaccination CVST and concomitant VITT, occurring in 36%–68% of cases [187, 189]. The presence of intracranial hemorrhage is an independent risk factor for death (OR, 4.544; 95% CI 2.188–9.437) [187]. Available evidence suggests that anti-platelet factor-4 autoimmune antibodies are involved in the pathogenesis of VITT. In light of AD, amyloid-β-targeting monoclonal antibody immunotherapies have emerged as a promising but highly arguable treatment for AD. Data from large-scale clinical trials have revealed that 10%–30% of AD patients experience amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H) (cerebral microhemorrhages, cerebral microhemorrhages, and superficial siderosis) after receiving different anti-amyloid-β immunotherapies [190–195]. Existing data suggest that antibody-mediated amyloid-β deposition in vessels and perivascular inflammation contribute to ARIA-H [196]. Given the common occurrence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy in AD, elderly AD patients with amyloid-β-targeting treatment may have an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Despite diverse immune mechanisms underlying intracranial hemorrhage triggered by VITT and anti-amyloid-β immunotherapies, cautions should be paid to administration of adenoviral COVID-19 vaccine in AD patients receiving treatment with anti-amyloid-β antibody [197]. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately evaluate comorbidities and risk factors in the frail AD population before COVID-19 vaccination.",
            "Accumulating evidence supports a mechanistic link between AD and COVID-19 (Fig. 2). It has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 virus could enter the brain, although the routes remain controversial [13, 198]. However, very low levels of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are detected in the brains of patients dying from COVID-19 [86, 104–106]. Consistent with the post-mortem findings, CSF data from COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms illustrated that direct infection of the CNS with SARS-CoV-2 seems to be rare [199]. Strikingly, prominent microglial activation in the white matter of the brainstem, hippocampus and cerebellum is observed in post-mortem studies of COVID-19 patients, along with accumulations of parenchymal cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These observations suggested that COVID-19-related neuropathological alterations are not directly induced by the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain, but are most likely mediated by the neuroimmune system. The latest data on the CSF profile indicated that the blood-CSF barrier disruption in the absence of intrathecal inflammation is a cardinal feature of COVID-19 patients with neurological involvement, compatible with cerebrospinal endotheliopathy [127, 199]. These results revealed that the peripheral SARS-CoV-2 virus imposes an adverse impact on the CNS through disruption of the blood-CSF barrier, regardless of manifestation of CNS symptoms. A large-scale single-cell transcriptome atlas revealed that severe COVID-19 induces pronounced systemic inflammation and cytokine storm [103]. Serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ, are dramatically elevated in critical COVID-19 patients and identified as markers of poor prognosis. Hyperactivation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in macrophage lineage cells mediates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contributes to the uncontrolled systemic immune response and promotes the development of severe COVID-19 [90, 200]. On the other hand, it is well-known that neuroinflammation is a key component of AD pathogenesis [201]. There is a complicated cross-talk between the peripheral and central immune systems in AD [202]. Serum IL-6 level has also been reported to be significantly higher in AD patients than in healthy controls [203]. The NLRP3 inflammasome is the most abundant inflammasome in the CNS and one of the key contributors to neuroinflammation in AD [204]. Hyperactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has also been proven to inhibit the phagocytosis of amyloid-β by microglia, and exacerbate amyloid-β deposition and tau pathology, which accelerate the initiation and development of AD pathology [205, 206]. These findings support that dysregulation of the immune signaling pathway could be a potential mechanism for the link between COVID-19 and AD. Systemic immune abnormality in AD may promote pro-inflammatory cytokine release and tissue damage under SARS-CoV-2 infection, which contribute to the critical illness of COVID-19. Recently, Magusali and colleagues provided new evidence for a genetic link between the risk of AD and critical outcomes of COVID-19 from the perspective of innate immune system in the brain. Their study identified single nucleotide polymorphisms of the OAS1 gene to be associated with both increased risk of AD and predisposition to severe COVID-19 [207]. They found that OAS1 is required to limit the pro-inflammatory response of myeloid cells induced by IFN-γ stimulation. On the contrary, OAS1 risk alleles for AD and severe COVID-19 are all linked with decreased OAS1 expression, which exaggerates the production of TNF-α with IFN-γ stimulation. These intersections between AD and COVID-19 point to a crucial role of regulating interferon pathways in the treatment of both diseases.Fig. 2Putative mechanisms of the link between COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease (AD). With the aid of TMPRSS2, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds with ACE2 to enter the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 virus may affect the brain in the following ways: vascular damage (BBB breakdown), systemic inflammation, and direct neuroinvasion. Neuroinflammation, OAS1, APOE genotype, aging, insulin resistance, acetylcholine, and Aβ may mediate the links between COVID-19 and AD. ACE2: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; Aβ: Amyloid-beta; APOE: apolipoprotein E; BBB: blood–brain barrier; COVID-19: Coronavirus disease 2019; NFTs: neurofibrillary tangles; NRP1: neuropilin 1; OAS1: oligoadenylate synthetase 1; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; TMPRSS2: transmembrane serine protease 2",

            "The impact of APOE variants on SARS-CoV-2 infection has been a focus in studies on the mechanistic link between AD and COVID-19. The ε4 allele of APOE is the strongest genetic risk factor for developing AD [208]. Recent studies also reported that APOE has an impact on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. APOE ε4 carriers exhibit an increased SARS-CoV-2 infection rate and mortality compared to non-carriers [147–149]. COVID-19 patients carrying APOE ε4 also show a significantly higher level of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines than patients with the APOE ε3/ε3 genotype [209]. Xiong et al. used a pathway analysis approach and identified APOE4 as an important risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 in patients with AD [210]. In human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and astrocytes, Wang and colleagues found that APOE ε4/ε4 genotype induces an increased rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection than the APOE ε3/ε3 genotype. Moreover, APOE4 astrocytes exhibited a more severe response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study provides the first insight into a possible APOE-mediated mechanism of COVID-19 vulnerability and severity [211]. The latest report by Ostendorf and colleagues further confirmed the influence of APOE variants on COVID-19 outcomes in an established SARS-CoV-2-infected APOE knock-in mouse model [148]. They demonstrated that APOE4 and APOE2 mice exhibit increased SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and insufficient antiviral immune responses early after infection compared to APOE3 mice. These findings highlight that the APOE4-mediated poor outcomes of COVID-19 are closely related to its effect on the host immune response. Zhang and colleagues found that although both APOE3 and APOE4 reduce ACE2-mediated Spike docking onto the cell surface by directly interacting with the ACE2 receptor, APOE4 indeed inhibits SARS-CoV-2 viral entry to a lesser extent compared to APOE3. They postulated that this disparity may be due to the more compact structure of APOE4 and its smaller spatial obstacle to compete against Spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor [209]. Pathway studies are required to further elucidate the molecular basis underlying APOE4-associated regulation of the vulnerability to and severity of COVID-19. Prospective studies are also warranted to evaluate APOE variants as a biomarker for identifying patients at high risk of poor outcomes of COVID-19.",
            "Aging is another compelling intersection between AD and COVID-19 [13]. AD is the most common neurodegenerative disease affecting aged people. Cellular senescence disturbs multiple homeostatic processes in the CNS, inducing chronic inflammation, BBB breakdown, amyloid deposits, and tau pathology, which in turn contribute to the pathogenesis of AD [212, 213]. Advanced age is also a well-recognized risk factor for developing serious illness and death from COVID-19. Previous data from the UK Biobank cohort showed that individuals aged ≥ 80 years have a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 hospitalization compared to the 65–69 age group (OR, 2.02; 95% CI 1.41–2.89) [14]. The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients aged 80 years or older is more than 20% [214]. It is also the case for the dementia population. The latest study focusing on vaccinated COVID-19 patients with dementia in the US found that older individuals with AD (age ≥ 80 years) have higher risks for breakthrough infections than younger patients with AD (age 65 to 79 years) (adjusted OR, 1.56; 95% CI 1.09–2.22) [183]. Aging-related factors, including immune surveillance impairment, chronic inflammation, and reactive oxygen species accumulation, are suggested to be associated with greater severity and mortality in aged COVID-19 patients [215]. Thus, aging-mediated mechanisms could be shared by both AD and COVID-19, although the key intersections between AD and COVID-19 in aging-related pathways remain to be determined.",
            "Emerging evidence from human and animal studies supports that altered brain insulin resistance is also an important pathological hallmark of AD [216], and regarded as one of the molecular links between AD and diabetes mellitus. Dysregulation of the innate immune system and cytokine-mediated chronic low-grade inflammation induced by insulin resistance in the periphery has been well understood [217]. The pre-existing insulin resistance-induced chronic inflammation would facilitate augmentation of systemic immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection, which significantly increases the risk of critical illness of COVID-19. Moreover, insulin resistance-related comorbidities, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, are highly prevalent, which implicate a higher risk of developing AD and severe COVID-19 [218, 219]. However, the precise mechanisms of increased COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in AD in the presence of insulin resistance are still poorly understood and deserve further exploration.",
            "Progressive presynaptic cholinergic denervation is a prominent pathological manifestation of AD, accompanied by decreased choline acetyltransferase activity and acetylcholine concentrations in the brain. These abnormalities closely correlate with cognitive deficits in AD. In addition to mediating synaptic signal transmission, acetylcholine interacts with α7-nAChR to protect neurons against neurotoxicity induced by amyloid-β and tau pathology [220]. On the other hand, a growing body of evidence has shown that acetylcholine stimulation of α7-nAChR on macrophages could remarkably attenuate systemic inflammation response [172]. Further studies demonstrated that cholinergic T cells within the spleen but not cholinergic nerve cells are the source of acetylcholine that stimulates α7-nAChR on splenic macrophages to mediate the anti-inflammatory effect. Considering the observations of a low smoking prevalence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients as well as uncontrolled cytokine storm in severe COVID-19, it is postulated that dysfunction of the nicotinic cholinergic system plays a role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 [221, 222]. Recently, the decline of acetylcholine production in the brains of AD patients is hypothesized to contribute to the elevation of COVID-19 mortality, although the influence of AD on peripheral cholinergic T cells is still unclear [13]. Therefore, the involvement of acetylcholine in the mechanistic link between AD and COVID-19 and the molecular mechanisms need to be elucidated in further studies.",
            "In addition to the abovementioned contributors, other potential factors underlying the mechanistic links between AD and COVID-19 are being explored. Recently, the presence of amyloid-β1-42 is reported to enhance the binding of the Spike protein S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, which facilitates the viral entry and exaggerates production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [223]. Consequently, increased plasma concentrations of amyloid-β in AD patients contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in AD. Moreover, data from human brain tissues have shown that the protein level of ACE2 in AD patients is upregulated compared to that in cognitively normal controls [224]. This makes AD patients more predisposed to CNS infection and adverse outcomes by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, disruption of the ACE/ACE2 balance in AD is postulated as a contributor to the infection and severity of COVID-19 [198]. Taken together, an in-depth exploration of shared pathogenic mechanisms between AD and COVID-19 is warranted in the future, which could also in turn provide new insights into the identification of biomarkers to track disease progression and treatments of AD.",
            "There is an interaction between COVID-19 infection and neurodegenerative diseases. On the one hand, COVID-19 infection causes worsening of symptomatic severity and acceleration of neurodegeneration in PD and AD. On the other hand, neurodegenerative diseases increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 and enhances the risks of hospitalization and death after viral infection. The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly changed the way of medical care; telemedicine services, vaccination, and specific drug therapies are promising measures for better management of PD and AD patients. Many potential molecular and cellular pathways are hypothesized to be the link between COVID-19 infection and neurodegenerative diseases. However, it is still unclear if the SARS-CoV-2 virus promotes a neurodegenerative process. Current evidence only partly but not entirely supports a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of PD/AD. International efforts are needed to verify the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 with PD/AD.",

            "The rapidly evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. In COVID-19 patients, neurological manifestations such as impaired consciousness, stroke, and seizure have been reported, with a higher incidence in those with a more severe course of COVID-19 [2]. However, these manifestations not necessarily require direct infection of the peripheral (PNS) or the central nervous system (CNS), but could also occur secondary to a severe systemic reaction in response to a viral infection outside the nervous system. In the past months, reports of meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, or peripheral nerve affection in the context of COVID-19 were published, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect structures of the nervous system. However, a systematic review that differentiates between neurological symptoms occurring during systemic viral infections in general from SARS-CoV-2-specific neurological complications has not been published.",
            "The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein can bind to the host cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, which is of relevance to cell tropism [3, 4]. Processing and priming of the S protein by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) have been shown to be essential for the fusion of viral and host cellular membranes and entry of SARS-CoV-2 [5]. The ACE-2 receptor expression has recently been found on neurons and glial cells of several brain structures [6, 7], including the cerebral cortex, the striatum, the posterior hypothalamic area, the substantia nigra, and brain stem [8–11] (Fig. 1). While systematic and experimental studies regarding the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 are lacking [12], several mechanisms such as the transcribial route [13, 14], the axonal transport and trans-synaptic transfer [15–17], and the hematogenous and/or lymphatic route [18] are currently discussed as possible viral access routes to the brain. The invasion of the CNS via the transcribial route describes an infection of the olfactory epithelium and successional transmission through the cribriform plate to the subarachnoid space. In contrast, the axonal transport and trans-synaptic transfer would include the infection of various (peripheral) nerve terminals and a spreading along neurons, such as the olfactory bulb, the trigeminal nerve, or the vagus nerve in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, respectively [16, 17, 19]. A third route postulates a CNS invasion by SARS-CoV-2 through the bloodstream or the lymphatic system [18]. Migration across the brain endothelium could be achieved by direct infection of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) and abluminal virus release into the CNS parenchyma [17], or by endocytosis, via virally infected leukocytes or disrupted tight junctions on BMECs. All these pathways may lead to neurological affection by direct infection of the PNS or CNS (Fig. 2a).Fig. 1Neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor of target cell. Cleavage of the S protein by type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2), facilitates viral entry. ACE-2 mRNA expression and double-positive ACE-2 + TMPRSS2 + cells have been identified, amongst others, on neurons and glial cells, in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, substantia nigra and brain stem, making the CNS potential direct targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Adapted from Servier Medical Art, https://smart.servier.com)Fig. 2Neuropathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. a Three potential mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 invasion into the CNS.

Neither acute symptomatic seizures, nor status epilepticus were observed in a more extensive retrospective study involving 304 COVID-19 patients [41].",
            "Seven single-case reports on meningitis/encephalitis in association with COVID-19 have been published. In two of these patients, CSF was positive for SARS-CoV-2: One case of viral encephalitis was reported from China with only minimal clinical details provided [42]. Another case of encephalitis was reported in a patient from Japan [39], presenting with altered consciousness, generalized seizure, and positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in CSF, as well as a pathological cerebral MRI (right lateral ventriculitis and encephalitis mainly on the right mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus). In three further cases, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in CSF: in one case from China, a cerebral CT was normal, but no MRI was performed, thus again, leaving uncertainty in the diagnosis of encephalitis [43]. A case of COVID-19 with tuberculous meningitis was also reported from China, with CSF positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis and negative for SARS-CoV-2, and a pathological cerebral CT [44]. The third case, from Italy, showed an unremarkable cerebral CT and MRI (including with gadolinium); the EEG showed generalized slowing [45]. For the remaining two cases, no SARS-CoV-2 CSF testing was performed. One case of acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy was reported from the US. MRI showed hemorrhagic rim enhancing lesions within the thalamus bilaterally, the medial temporal lobes, and subinsular regions [46]. Another case from the US showed a normal cerebral CT and a generalized slowing in the EEG [40], but no epileptic discharges.",
            "Finally, a case of flaccid myelitis, in which neither CSF nor MRI analyses were performed, was reported [47] (Online Resource Table II).",
            "Zhao et al. [48] reported a patient with GBS, who developed symptoms of COVID-19 during an in-hospital stay, suggesting a co-incidental association. Gutiérrez-Ortiz [49] described one case of Miller Fisher syndrome (with positive antibodies against GD1b-IgG) and a case of polyneuritis cranialis. In both patients, SARS-CoV-2 PCR in CSF was negative.",
            "One case of oculomotor nerve palsy was reported in a COVID-19 patient. The cerebral MRI was not conclusive, and SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in CSF [50].",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the biggest medical challenges of this century. The wealth of medical data generated is contrasted by the dearth of data on the frequency of neurological symptoms and occurrence of (rare) neurological complications.",
            "As summarized above, headache, dizziness, and impaired consciousness are neurological symptoms frequently observed in patients with COVID-19. Such symptoms are not specific for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and may also be found in other viral infections. These symptoms do not necessarily postulate an infection of underlying neurological structures, but could also occur via indirect mechanisms of neuropathogenicity, e.g., as a consequence of respiratory distress, hypoxia, or due to hypotonia, dehydration, and fever during sepsis. Indirect mechanisms of neuropathogenicity may be sufficient to explain headache and dizziness as frequent non-specific symptoms in mild or moderate, as well as impaired consciousness in severe or critical COVID-19 patients. The latter might be confounded by the fact that impaired consciousness is frequently noted in hospitalized elderly patients.",
            "Interestingly, a high frequency of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients has been noted. A loss of olfactory function in viral infections is well known in otolaryngology. Viruses such as rhinovirus, parainfluenza, Epstein–Barr virus, and some other CoVs may cause olfactory dysfunction through an inflammatory reaction within the nasal mucosa and the occurrence of rhinorrhea [51, 52]. Data published by Lechien and colleagues suggest, however, that olfactory dysfunction associated with COVID-19 infection may appear in the absence of rhinorrhea [33]. Therefore, nasal inflammation and related obstruction may not be the only etiological factors underlying the frequent observation of smell and taste dysfunctions in patients with COVID-19. Indeed, the transcribial route has been suggested as one possible route of SARS-CoV-2 to the brain and its direct infection.",
            "Yet, data on direct brain infection by SARS-CoV-2 are very limited. Moriguchi et al. and Poyiadji et al. described the most compelling cases of encephalitis with the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in CSF, constituting strong evidence for neurotropism [39]. Notwithstanding, in most reports on encephalitis and related disorders, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was neither detected in CSF, nor relevant further examinations such as CSF analyses and cerebral MRI scans were performed. Therefore, these reports are unable to support the described single observations further. A recently published autopsy series, available after the data cut-off date of this systematic study and thus not included in the results section of this manuscript, has shown that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the brain of 7 of 22 individuals studied [53]. This strongly supports neurotropism, warranting further assessment of its clinical relevance. The neuropathological features may be distinct from other viral encephalitides, as widespread microscopic infarcts and hemorrhagic white matter lesions were revealed, but not the prominent microglial nodules and perivascular inflammation, suggesting a vascular origin with secondary myelin loss during CNS inflammation [54–56].",
            "Seizures in patients with COVID-19 might occur in consequence of direct brain infection, but only single reports of patients with seizures exist so far. Thus, current evidence does not suggest an additional risk of seizures in COVID-19 [41].",
            "Encephalopathy, rather than encephalitis, may occur due to indirect mechanism of neuropathogenicity, such as hypoxic encephalopathy found in deceased COVID-19 patients [26]. In these cases, ARDS may act synergistically with intracranial hypertension, rendering the brain vulnerable to both amyloid-beta accumulation and cytokine-mediated hippocampal damage [57]. Hyper-inflammatory systemic responses may further contribute to neurological symptoms and rare but severe neurological complications. A focal parenchymal infiltrate of T lymphocytes above the normal range was detected in two autopsy cases [55]. This activated systemic immune response might ultimately lead to fatal encephalopathy or chronic CNS demyelination associated with long-term sequelae, depending on viral and host factors that may influence disease severity [17]. T-helper 1 cells producing IFN-γ and GM-CSF, previously reported in CNS neuroinflammation [20], have also been found in COVID-19 patients in intensive care units [21]. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that severely affected COVID-19 patients might suffer from a cytokine storm syndrome, which has been implicated as the putative mechanism underlying a case of COVID-19 associated with acute necrotizing encephalopathy [46].",
            "Concerning peripheral neurological immune-mediated complications, Gutiérrez-Ortiz et al. [49] reported two patients with Miller Fisher syndrome and polyneuritis cranialis in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Miller Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain–Barré syndrome, is an autoimmune disease that can manifest a few days to weeks following a viral upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection. These reports may suggest that neurological complications of COVID-19 could occur as para-infectious autoimmune-mediated complications. Such complications are not specific for SARS-CoV-2, and currently available single reports do not suggest that the frequency is exceptionally high in COVID-19 patients.",
            "Acute cerebrovascular events have been mostly observed in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 disease course [2]. Nevertheless, such associations are based on a limited number of cases and are irresolute, because patients with severe or complicated disease courses are more likely to suffer from relevant comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension. These factors portray independent risk factors for cerebrovascular diseases and connote a strong association bias. Moreover, glucose imbalances, believed to impact on the homeostasis of the brain, have been described in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with diabetes [24]. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 might further drive dyslipidemia, which might associate with disease progression from mild to critical [25]. In severe or fatal COVID-19 cases, coagulopathy, including elevated D-dimer levels, prolonged prothrombin time, and decreased platelet counts have been highlighted in a recent meta-analysis [22]. Interestingly, hyper-fibrinolysis, as reflected by elevated serum D-dimer, was present in 97% of COVID-19 non-survivors at admission [58] and 71.4% of non-survivors met the criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation [59]. For this reason, severely affected patients might also be more susceptible to cerebrovascular disease [2]. The other way round, patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular conditions, are more likely to have worse clinical outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly due to plasmin, a key player in fibrinolysis, contributing to enhanced virulence and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 [60].",
            "With this review, we sought to identify the neurological features of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. We found that frequently reported neurological symptoms comprise headache, dizziness, taste and smell dysfunctions, or impaired consciousness. These symptoms, however, are non-specific for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Taste and smell dysfunction may indicate neurotropism. However, reports on direct brain infection remain scarce. Risks for other more severe neurological complications, such as cerebrovascular disease including ischemic strokes, might be increased; systematic analysis so far is hindered by the low number of associated cases reported and known interactions of vascular risk factors with a severe or critical COVID-19 disease course.",
            "Further studies will be needed to address whether neurological symptoms manifest due to direct infection of structures of the nervous system, constitute a reflection of a systemic inflammatory syndrome, or occur as a consequence of the higher prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities. Even though reports of anosmia and few cases of encephalitis suggest a neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2, additional experimental studies are mandatory to confirm the pathophysiological mechanisms. In addition, the early involvement of neurologists in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, and standardized international registries, such as the Lean European Open Survey for SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients (LEOSS) [61] with neurological items already integrated, will help to further elucidate the clinical relevance of this topic. Such registry may also include common neurologic disease as underlying condition to a larger extent than in the literature reviewed here, allowing to assess the possible influence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on neurological conditions, and vice versa. In the absence of valid data, the pandemic caused considerable worries in a population with chronic neurological disability, such as in persons with multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, or dementia. However, it has not been demonstrated so far that a patient group with chronic neurological disease, but no cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, or metabolic disorder, is at higher risk of a less favorable outcome following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, although it has been speculated that individuals exposed to certain immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapy, e.g. for multiple sclerosis or brain tumors may experience a more severe COVID-19 disease course, evidence is lacking to support this assumption. Certain immunotherapies may even have the potential to protect from severe autoinflammatory reactions, and thus may even have beneficial effects, currently tested in clinical trials (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04280588; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04343768).",

            "Viral infections have detrimental impacts on neurological functions, and even to cause severe neurological damage. Very recently, coronaviruses (CoV), especially severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exhibit neurotropic properties and may also cause neurological diseases. It is reported that CoV can be found in the brain or cerebrospinal fluid. The pathobiology of these neuroinvasive viruses is still incompletely known, and it is therefore important to explore the impact of CoV infections on the nervous system. Here, we review the research into neurological complications in CoV infections and the possible mechanisms of damage to the nervous system.",
            "In December 2019, Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic emerged in Wuhan, China, causing global attentions (Thompson, 2020). The virus is known as especially severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was recently documented that, in addition to systemic and respiratory symptoms, 36.4% (78/214) of patients with COVID-19 develop neurological symptoms, including headache, disturbed consciousness, and paresthesia. Severely affected patients are more likely to develop neurological symptoms than patients who have mild or moderate disease (Mao et al., 2020). Additionally, autopsy reports have revealed brain tissue edema and partial neuronal degeneration in deceased patients (Xu et al., 2020). Furthermore, on March 4, 2020, Beijing Ditan Hospital reported for the first time a case of viral encephalitis caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) attacking the central nervous system (CNS). The researchers confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid by genome sequencing. It illustrated that COVID-19 has potential to cause nervous system damage (Xiang et al., 2020). With the now ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is particularly necessary to make clinicians aware of the impact of various CoV infections on the CNS. This article reviews the epidemiology, possible mechanisms of neuroinvasion, and management strategies pertaining to CoV infections with potential nervous system involvement.",
            "Many viral infections can cause serious damage to the structure and function of the nervous system, including severe encephalitis due to viral infections in the CNS, toxic encephalopathy caused by severe systemic viral infections, and severe acute demyelinating lesions developing after viral infections. (Michalicova et al., 2017, Wright et al., 2008). Some viruses are neurotropic and can invade nervous tissues and cause infections of immune-functioning macrophages, microglia, or astrocytes in the CNS (Al-Obaidi et al., 2018, Soung and Klein, 2018).",
            "CoV have an average diameter of 100 nm, and they are spherical or oval. There are large spikes of viral membrane glycoproteins on the surface, and, when observed by electron microscopy, these negatively stained virus particles show a typical crown-like shape. CoV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, which harbors the largest genome among currently known RNA viruses, with a genome length of about 26–32 kb (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). The pathogen of the now ongoing novel pneumonia outbreak is the novel CoV 2019 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the seventh known CoV that can infect humans; the remaining six are HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Corman et al., 2019). The most common and important types of CoV infections with potential nervous system damage are described below.",
            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a zoonotic respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV that started in Asia and spread throughout the world in 2003. It has the characteristics of acute onset and strong infectivity, and is a great threat to human health. The main clinical manifestations of SARS are fever, chills, dry cough, and difficulty breathing. In severe cases, respiratory failure and death may occur (Lai et al., 2004). In addition, SARS-CoV could induce neurological diseases such as polyneuropathy, encephalitis, and aortic ischemic stroke (Tsai et al., 2005). Autopsy studies demonstrated that signs of cerebral edema and meningeal vasodilation could be detected in most cases of SARS. Furthermore, infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes in the vessel wall, ischemic changes of neurons, demyelinationn of nerve fibers, as well as SARS-CoV virus particles and genome sequences could be detected in the brain (Gu et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2003).",
            "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), caused by MERS-CoV, originates from bats, and the intermediate host is camel. Patients with MERS-CoV infection usually present with pneumonia-related symptoms, such as fever, myalgia, cough, and dyspnea. Severe cases can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, multiple organ failure, and death (WHO MERS-Cov Research, 2013). MERS-CoV is known to be potentially neuroinvasive, and that a retrospective study found that 25.7% of patients with MERS can develop insanity and 8.6% of patients have seizures (Saad et al., 2014). Kim et al. also reported that almost 1/5 of patients with MERS-CoV infection show neurological symptoms during the infection process, including but not limited to disturbance of consciousness, paralysis, ischemic stroke, Guillain-Barre syndrome and other poisoning or infectious neuropathy. Interestingly, their neurological complications are not accompanied by respiratory symptoms, but delayed by 2–3 weeks (Kim et al., 2017).",
            "The genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is 79.5%, and its similarity to bat coronavirus is as high as 96% (Wu et al., 2020). Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have symptoms of varying degrees, ranging from fever or a mild cough to pneumonia and extensive involvement of multiple organ functions with a mortality rate of 2% to 4%. At present, clinical data have revealed that some patients with COVID-19 have symptoms similar to intracranial infections such as headache, epilepsy, and disturbed consciousness. Moreover, a growing number of COVID-19 patients report a sudden loss of smell or taste. It is therefore likely that anosmia and dysgeusia might be observed in patients with COVID-19 (Giacomelli et al., 2020, Ryan, 2020, Hopkins and Kumar, 2020). In fact, some even develop COVID-19-related symptoms only after showing neurologic symptoms (Mao et al., 2020). Recently, Beijing Ditan Hospital reported for the first time a case of viral encephalitis caused by the novel CoV attacking the CNS. The researchers confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid by genome sequencing, adding support to the theory this new pneumonia virus can also cause nervous system damage (Xiang et al., 2020). It is therefore likely that other pathogenic bacteria, such as bacteria, may destroy the blood–brain barrier, and secondary intracranial infections may cause headaches, projectile vomiting, visual loss, and limb convulsions in patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms.",
            "Encephalitis refers to inflammatory lesions in the brain parenchyma caused by pathogens, including neuronal damage and nerve tissue lesions. It is characterized by acute onset, and common symptoms include headache, fever (mainly high fever), vomiting, convulsions, and consciousness disorders (Ellul and Solomon, 2018). Early diagnosis of viral encephalitis is critical. In the ongoing pneumonia epidemic, the treatment team of Beijing Ditan Hospital confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with COVID-19 by genome sequencing, thereby clinically verifying viral encephalitis (Xiang et al., 2020). This provided a solid basis for CoV causing the encephalitis.",
            "Infectious toxic encephalopathy, also known as acute toxic encephalitis, refers to a type of reversible brain dysfunction syndrome caused by factors such as systemic toxemia, metabolic disorders, and hypoxia during the process of acute infection (Mizuguchi et al., 2007, Tauber et al., 2017, Young, 2013). The basic pathological changes in this disease include cerebral edema, with no evidence of inflammation on cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Its clinical symptoms are complex and diverse. Patients with a mild course of the disease may develop headache, dysphoria, mental disorder, and delirium. Seriously affected patients may experience disorientation, loss of consciousness, coma, and paralysis (Dobbs, 2011, Mizuguchi et al., 2007). Acute viral infection is also an important cause of this disease, exemplified by a respiratory infection caused by CoV. Patients with COVID-19 often suffer from severe hypoxia and viremia (Guo et al., 2020), which has the potential to cause toxic encephalopathy. Moreover, almost 40% of patients with COVID-19 develop headache, disturbed consciousness, and other brain dysfunction symptoms (Mao et al., 2020), and that an autopsy study reported that edema has been detected in brain tissue of COVID-19 patients (Xu et al., 2020). Collectively, these findings provide the evidence that COVID-19 could cause infectious toxic encephalopathy, although detailed studies are greatly required.",
            "A considerable amount of evidence indicates that especially respiratory-related infection is an independent risk factor for acute cerebrovascular disease (Elkind, 2007, Warren-Gash et al., 2018). Data from the use of experimental mouse models suggests that influenza virus can aggravate ischemic brain injury by triggering a cytokine cascade and increase the risk of cerebral hemorrhage after treatment with tissue-type plasminogen activator (Muhammad et al., 2011). The infection of CoV, especially SARS-CoV-2, has been widely reported to cause cytokine storm syndromes, which may be one of the factors that CoV cause acute cerebrobasilar disease (Mehta et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2020). In addition, critically ill patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections often show elevated levels of D-dimer and severe platelet reduction, which may render these patients prone to acute cerebrovascular events (Wang et al., 2020). It is therefore likely that during CoV infections, patients at risk of developing cerebrovascular disease should be alerted with regard to the occurrence of acute cerebrovascular events.",
            "The genetic material and even proteins of various viruses can often be detected in nervous system tissue samples (such as cerebrospinal fluid or brain), suggesting that viruses can directly invade the nervous system and cause nerve damage (Koyuncu et al., 2013, Leber et al., 2016).",
            "A typical virus entering the CNS through the blood circulation is the JE virus, which multiplies in the vascular cells of the skin area affected by the mosquito bite. It is subsequently released into the blood to reproduce in mononuclear macrophages throughout the body. The secondary release into the blood may increase the permeability of the blood–brain barrier through the produced cytokines, thereby promoting the virus to enter the brain and causing viral encephalitis (Unni et al., 2011). Although there is rare evidence that CoV, especially SARS-CoV-2, invade the nervous system via the blood circulation pathway (Koyuncu et al., 2013, Desforges et al., 2019), subsequent studies are expected.",
            "Neuronal pathway is important vehicles for neurotropic viruses to enter the CNS. Viruses can migrate by infecting sensory or motor nerve endings, achieving retrograde or anterograde neuronal transport through the motor proteins, dynein and kinesins (Swanson and McGavern, 2015). An example of a neuronal pathway is that of olfactory neuron transport. The unique anatomical organization of olfactory nerves and the olfactory bulb in the nasal cavity and forebrain effectively makes it a channel between the nasal epithelium and the CNS (Koyuncu et al., 2013). As a consequence, CoV can enter the brain through the olfactory tract in the early stages of infection or nasal vaccination (Desforges et al., 2019, Mori, 2015). For example, after CoV infects nasal cells, it can reach the entire brain and cerebrospinal fluid through the olfactory nerve and olfactory bulb within 7 days and cause inflammation and demyelinating reaction. However, removal of the olfactory bulb in the mice, resulted in a restricted invasion of CoV into the CNS (Bohmwald et al., 2018). Gu et al. also detected SARS virus particles and genome sequences in brain neurons (Gu et al., 2005). The observations mentioned here indicate that CoV can invade the CNS from the periphery through neural pathways.",
            "When a virus proliferates in lung tissue cells, it causes diffuse alveolar and interstitial inflammatory exudation, edema, and the formation of transparent membranes. This, in turn, leads to alveolar gas exchange disorders causing hypoxia in the CNS, increasing anaerobic metabolism in the mitochondria of brain cells (Abdennour et al., 2012). The accumulation of acid can cause cerebral vasodilation, swelling of brain cells, interstitial edema, obstruction of cerebral blood flow, and even headache due to ischemia and congestion (Abdennour et al., 2012). If the hypoxia continues unabated, cerebral edema and the cerebral circulation disorder may worsen sharply. With intracranial hypertension, the brain function gradually deteriorates, and drowsiness, bulbar conjunctival edema, and even coma can be observed (Abdennour et al., 2012). In addition, for patients at particular risk of developing cerebrovascular disease, hypoxia may also induce the occurrence of acute cerebrovascular disease such as acute ischemic stroke. Owing to the fact that the patients with COVID-19 often suffer from severe hypoxia (Guo et al., 2020), hypoxia injury may cause subsequent nervous system damage.",
            "Nervous system damage caused by viral infection may be mediated by the immune system (Klein et al., 2017). The pathology of severe viral infections is closely linked to the development of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS could be abnormally initiated in severe pneumonia caused by CoV infection, while early anti-inflammatory intervention effectively prevent immune damage and reduce the risk of injury in the nervous system (Mehta et al., 2020, Fu et al., 2010). Furthermore, SARS and COVID-19 have resulted in a large number of fatalities, most of which have been due to multiple organs failure (MOF) caused by virus-induced SIRS or SIRS-like immune disorders (Yin et al., 2004, Chen et al., 2020). The persistence of CoV infections and its ability to infect macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes in the CNS are particularly important. A neurotropic virus can activate glial cells and induce a pro-inflammatory state (Li et al., 2004). interleukin (IL)-6, an important member of the cytokine storm, is positively correlated with the severity of COVID-2019 symptoms (Wan et al., 2020). Additionally, experiments have confirmed that primary glial cells cultured in vitro secrete a large amount of inflammatory factors such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, and TNF-α after being infected with CoV (Bohmwald et al., 2018). Furthermore, activation of immune cells in the brain will cause chronic inflammation and brain damage.",
            "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a cardio-cerebral vascular protection factor existing in a variety of organs, including the nervous system and skeletal muscles, playing a major role in regulating blood pressure and anti-atherosclerosis mechanisms (Miller and Arnold, 2019). Meanwhile, ACE2 is also an important target for various CoV and influenza viruses (Turner et al., 2004, Wrapp et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2014). Binding to ACE2 receptors, the above-mentioned viruses may cause abnormally elevated blood pressure and increase the risk of cerebral hemorrhage. In addition, given that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could interact with ACE2 expressed in the capillary endothelium, the virus may also damage the blood–brain barrier and enter the CNS by attacking the vascular system (Baig et al., 2020).",
            "The biological properties of the CNS may facilitate exacerbation of the neurological damage caused by CoV infections. The CNS has a dense parenchymal structure and the usual lack of permeability of its blood vessels is a barrier to virus invasion. However, if a virus gains access to the CNS, it is difficult to remove (Reinhold and Rittner, 2017). Due to the lack of major histocompatibility complex antigens in nerve cells, the elimination of viruses in nerve cells depends solely on the role of cytotoxic T cells; however, the apoptosis of mature neurons after virus infection also has a relatively protective effect (Wuthrich et al., 2015). Furthermore, the homeostasis characteristics of the cells in the CNS also contribute to the continued existence of the virus (Reinhold and Rittner, 2017) (Fig. 1\n; Fig. 2\n).Fig. 1The mechanisms of coronaviruses infections and neurological damage caused by coronaviruses. The coronaviruses can cause nerve damage through direct infection pathways (blood circulation pathways and neuronal pathways), hypoxia, immune injury, ACE2, and other mechanisms. Meanwhile, the coronaviruses have detrimental effects to attack the lung tissue, and causes a series of lung lesions such as hypoxia. Furthermore, the coronaviruses can enter the nervous system directly through the olfactory nerve, and also enter the nervous system through blood circulation and neuronal pathways, resulting in neurological disorders.

            "Neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are less noticeable than the respiratory symptoms, but they may be associated with disability and mortality in COVID-19. Even though Omicron caused less severe disease than Delta, the incidence of neurological manifestations is similar. More than 30% of patients experienced “brain fog”, delirium, stroke, and cognitive impairment, and over half of these patients presented abnormal neuroimaging outcomes. In this review, we summarize current advances in the clinical findings of neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients and compare them with those in patients with influenza infection. We also illustrate the structure and cellular invasion mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and describe the pathway for central SARS-CoV-2 invasion. In addition, we discuss direct damage and other pathological conditions caused by SARS-CoV-2, such as an aberrant interferon response, cytokine storm, lymphopenia, and hypercoagulation, to provide treatment ideas. This review may offer new insights into preventing or treating brain damage in COVID-19."

            "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in December 2019, in Wuhan, China and was promptly declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). As an acute respiratory disease, COVID-19 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is the same receptor used by its predecessor, SARS-CoV, to enter and spread through the respiratory tract. Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, fatigue and in a small population of patients, SARS-CoV-2 can cause several neurological symptoms. Neurological malaise may include severe manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular disease and meningitis/encephalitis. Although there is evidence showing that coronaviruses can invade the central nervous system (CNS), studies are needed to address the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS and to decipher the underlying neurotropic mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes current reports on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and addresses potential routes used by SARS-CoV-2 to invade the CNS.",
            "In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of unknown etiology was first reported in Wuhan, China. The etiology of the respiratory illness was attributed to a new strain of coronavirus and the disease was subsequently named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2020. The novel strain responsible for COVID-19 was officially named as Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). According to the WHO, as of July 10, 2020, globally there were ~12,322,395 cases of COVID-19 and 556,335 deaths confirmed (1). Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses that are comprised of a positive-sense single-strand RNA genome. Currently, there are seven strains of coronaviruses (CoV) that infect humans, including the 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV and 2, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43 are classified as part of the betacoronavirus (βCoV) genus (2), and two of the genus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were responsible for the outbreaks in 2003 and 2012, respectively. In addition to the severe respiratory symptoms, SARS-CoVs can be associated with neurological symptoms in infected patients (3, 4). Despite evidence pointing to the possibility of central nervous system (CNS) invasion by coronaviruses, clinical data on the significance of CNS involvement in patients with COVID-19 are relatively scarce and most information are derived from SARS-CoV (5). However, emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection could be implicated in damaging several organs, including the brain. During the early stages of the outbreak, reports indicated a high rate of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 positive patients (6–9). Because these symptoms involve the cranial nerves, it is suspected that SARS-CoV-2 can trigger neurological manifestations. In addition, most coronaviruses share a similar viral structure and infection mechanism (10, 11). In the early 2000s, after the outbreak of SARS-CoV, virus was detected in postmortem brains recovered from SARS positive patients (12). SARS-CoV enters the host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed in many different brain cells (13). Due to the genomic similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (14), and the shared affinity for the ACE2 receptor (15, 16), it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 can also target the brain, via receptor binding endocytosis/transcytosis. Thus, it is possible for COVID-19 positive patients to present with a severe infection that could ultimately manifest into neurological complications.",
            "In patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2, neurological manifestations have been reported in several studies, ranging from minor common symptoms such as headache and anosmia to more severe and less common complications such as seizure and stroke (17). Since the ACE2 receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 can be expressed in vascular endothelium of the CNS, this can explain the neurotropic potential of the virus (18, 19). To date, only a few reports have confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), while the key manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 remain predominantly in the lungs and in the immune system. Of note, is that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 is easily detected in the respiratory tract or the blood, allowing for a clear diagnosis of COVID-19. The severity and haste of the COVID-19 clinical course limit the accessibility for sampling and testing of CSF. However, several case studies have shown a clear link between severe COVID-19 infection and neurological manifestations, such as encephalitis, seizures, and cerebrovascular complications. Other common manifestations reported are dizziness, headaches, confusion, convulsions, and loss of consciousness. A retrospective study showed that 78 of 214 (36.4%) patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 presented characteristic neurological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitals from Wuhan, China (20). Elderly patients that are commonly presented with a more severe disease, are more likely to develop neurological symptoms compared to non-severe and younger patients. Similarly, a hospital in France reported that 49 of the 58 consecutive patients admitted for Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19, presented neurological manifestations (21). The most characteristic neurological manifestations presented by these patients were encephalopathy, prominent agitation and confusion, and diffuse corticospinal tract signs. A case study that described the results of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 pneumonia, showed that 50 out of 235 ICU patients (21%) developed neurological symptoms (22). Brain MRIs were performed in 27 out of the 50 (54%) patients with neurologic symptoms, and 10 out of 27 (37%) patients presented cortical signal abnormalities. In some cases, the observed abnormal cortical signals were accompanied by cortical diffusion restriction, leptomeningeal enhancement, or cortical blooming artifact. CSF obtained in 5 out of 10 patients with cortical signal abnormalities, showed negative for SARS-CoV-2. The authors explained the difficulties in discerning between direct neurotropism of COVID-19 with others virus-related manifestations such as cytokine storm syndrome, hypoxia, subclinical seizures and encephalopathy (22). An early report in March 2020, described a 74-year-old male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation, cardioembolic stroke, Parkinson's disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (23). The patient presented with severe alteration in mental status and was found to be encephalopathic. Cerebrospinal fluid studies did not show any evidence of CNS infection, however, due to the progression of his symptoms, the patient was tested for COVID-19 and was confirmed positive. Unfortunately, no further details were available in the case report. The authors concluded that SARS-CoV-2 does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and does not cause meningitis or encephalitis. This case report highlighted the importance of recognizing that encephalopathy may be a potential manifestation of COVID-19 (23). The first reported case of meningitis/encephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 was observed in a 24-year-old man, and was reported in April 2020 (24). The patient was brought to the hospital due to a convulsion accompanied by unconsciousness and was diagnosed with meningitis and viral pneumonia. Interestingly, the nasopharyngeal sample was negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but was positive in the CSF sample. Moriguchi and colleagues declared the importance of this case because it shows that unconscious patients are potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 and might cause the horizontal infection. The report warned the physicians of patients who have CNS symptoms that encephalitis may be the first indication, as well as respiratory symptoms, in identifying SARS-CoV-2 cases. Another case of meningitis, also reported in April 2020 by Duong et al., was detected in a 41-year-old female (25). Nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but they were unable to send her CSF sample for PCR testing to confirm for COVID-19. While the authors reported of COVID-19 infection as an isolated case of meningoencephalitis without respiratory involvement, they couldn't directly confirm the presence of the COVID-19 virus in the CSF (25). In May 2020, an update on the case reported earlier by Duong et al. confirmed that the CSF sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2. This was the first case where SARS-CoV-2 infection was completely constrained to the CNS, with no association to other organs (26).",
            "A potential association of COVID-19 with cerebrovascular diseases have been reported by several groups. A case of COVID-19–associated with acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy was described in a female in her late fifties, although her CSF sample was never tested SARS-CoV-2 (27). In another case, two patients presented with COVID-19 and with neurological symptoms simultaneously, although their CSF samples repeatedly tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA (28). The first patient was reported with a case of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage of grade 3 in the Hunt and Hess scale, and the second patient was reported with ischemic stroke and massive hemorrhagic conversion. Goldberg et al. reported the first case of COVID-19-related to acute cerebrovascular disease in a 64-year-old man. The patient died after 3 days due to COVID-19-related complications, and no further clinical evaluations were performed (29). In another case report from a hospital in Belgium, 3 out of 31 patients with advance tumor-like brain lesions, tested positive with SARS-CoV-2 (30). All three patients suffered from diffuse intraparenchymal hemorrhage post-operatively, suggesting that an active infection may be related to a higher bleeding risk. In June 2020, a case series from King's College Hospital (KCH) in the United Kingdom, demonstrated five consecutive cases of predominantly lobar COVID-19-associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (31). The cases were detected in patients with an average age of 52.2 years (range of 41–64 years): an age group that was particularly lower than expected for conventional ICH.",
            "Seizures and epilepsy are less commonly reported neurological manifestations seen in COVID-19 patients. In a retrospective multicenter study from several hospitals in China, it was reported that 84 of 304 (27%) patients had brain insults or metabolic imbalances during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection, which is known to increase the risk of seizures (32). However, no new onset of seizures or status epilepticus were seen. The authors suggested that although the risk of suffering from seizures during acute COVID-19 illness is minimum, severely ill patients with underlying conditions have a higher risk of seizure occurrence. In another case, a 54-year-old woman who tested positive for COVID-19, was admitted with a case of disturbance of consciousness and seizures. MRI from the patient's brain and spine showed a new onset of multiple, non-enhancing demyelinating lesions (33). Similarly, the CSF sample tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. According to the authors, a possible cause for the observed neurological damage is due to the severe pneumonia that leads to CNS hypoxia triggering neurological damage. Taken together, these reports provide a potential association of SARS-CoV-2 with neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19. With the pandemic limiting hospital resources and the haste of the disease, it is possible that other similar cases of neurological symptoms in patients with COVID-19 were not confirmed or reported because of the inability to detect the virus in CSF samples, or because of rapid clinical deterioration in patients.",
            "In order to investigate the coexistence of coronaviruses within the CNS, a study by Niu and colleagues, created a fatal encephalitis virus attached to a luciferase reporter, that can be infected in animal model. Viral titer in mice infected with the HCoVOC43-ns2DelRluc, was reported by bioluminescence imaging (34). The authors showed viral infection in the CNS (brain and spinal cord), validating that this mouse model can be used as a tool to study coronaviruses in the CNS (34). The advantage of using this mouse model is that viral titer is measured in real time, allowing for the study of virus progression through the mouse's body. Although the viral-infected mouse model was used for a known neurotropic coronavirus, the model can be a useful tool to study SARS-CoV-2, as the virus has been observed in the frontal lobe suggesting that it can migrate to the CNS (18). Given the difficulties of obtaining samples and performing extensive analysis in hospitals, these reports and emerging experimental studies are critical for understanding the potential neurotropism and neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Alarming reports describing the elderly population as more susceptible to poor outcomes with COVID-19 (35–37), this has sparked growing concerns about COVID-19 and chronic diseases comorbidities. The tendency of severe COVID-19 illness in older individuals has been strongly associated with age-related loss of protein homeostasis (38). Elderly individuals often experience a decrease in the activation of the autophagy pathway and other stress responses, that can result in an accumulation of protein aggregates: a characteristic of neurodegenerative disorders associated with aging, for example Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, suggesting that a possible long-term consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be the accelerated aging in tissues affected by the virus (38). In addition, patients with advanced PD may be at higher risk of suffering from pneumonia due to possible underlying respiratory dysfunction (39). Thus, it is likely that suffering from PD may increase the propensity of severe respiratory complications and poor outcomes during COVID-19 infection. Helmich and Bloem also addressed how higher levels of psychological stress and adaptive difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic may worsen several PD symptoms (39). Another neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuroinflammation is Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The excessive inflammatory and immune responses caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection may hasten the progression of inflammatory neurodegeneration in the brain among the elderly, increasing the risk for AD and the susceptibility to severe outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection (37).",
            "Although studies on SARS-CoV-2 and chronic neurological diseases are limited, previous studies on other coronavirus implicate systemic infection with other neuronal syndromes, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (40, 41). MS patients have an increased risk of infections compared to others, therefore these patients could be at higher risk of COVID-19 (42). However, several case reports suggest that MS patients develop mild disease and can recover from COVID-19 (43–45). This is likely due to the immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory therapy used for MS on modulating the cytokine storm caused by SARS-CoV-2. A study showed that patients taking the immunosuppressant, fingolimod, can mount an effective immune response against SARS-CoV-2, via antibody-secreting cells, despite having low levels of T-lymphocyte subsets (46). In terms of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, a case report from 2004, showed the detection of human coronavirus in the CSF of a child presumed to have acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Authors suggested that coronavirus may represent an important etiological agent in the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease (41). Other reports have associated Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) as a consequence of the peripheral nervous system injury due to the hyperinflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2. Zhao described a case report of COVID-19 associated with acute GBS (47), in which they speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could have been the causative agent for the development of GBS. Moreover, the first appearance of GBS symptoms in the patient coincided with the period of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, it is possible that GBS associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection might follow a parainfectious profile. Another case report described the possible correlation between acute COVID-19 infection and GBS in a 71-year-old male patient (48). The patient was presented with a severe form of acute polyradiculoneuritis with prominent demyelinating features and a subsequent diagnosis of GBS associated with COVID-19 was made. Taken together, these studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2-mediated inflammation may accelerate the progression of pre-existing neurological conditions. It remains unknown if patients suffering from immune-mediated inflammatory diseases are at higher risk of COVID-19 severity. However, special attention should be given to a possible cross-reactive of immunity between SARS-CoV-2 antigens and host tissues that could develop or worsen the immune system disorders.",
            "The exact mechanism used by SARS-CoV-2 to invade the CNS has not been fully elucidated. Given the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the infection mechanism reported in previous outbreaks may also be pertinent for SARS-CoV-2. It is well-documented that the host receptor ACE2, used by SARS-CoV-2 for viral entry, is expressed in numerous human cells, such as respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells, endothelial cells, kidney cells, alveolar monocytes/macrophages, and cerebral neurons and glia (49–52). In fact, a study provided further evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds to ACE2 receptor with higher affinity when compared to the S-protein expressed by SARS-CoV (53).",
            "There are two major routes proposed for SARS-CoV-2 invasion into the brain: the hematogenous and neuronal retrograde routes (2, 50, 54, 55). In the hematogenous route, the virus invades the brain by infecting the epithelial cells of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and/or the endothelial cells of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). This route of invasion was supported by Paniz-Mondolfi et al. (18), who detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in neural and capillary endothelial cells in postmortem frontal lobe tissue from a COVID-19 patient. In the neuronal retrograde route, the virus invades the CNS by infecting peripheral neurons. Many COVID-19 positive patients, especially with mild cases, suffer from hypogeusia (reduced ability of taste), as well as anosmia (decreased sense of smell) (7, 56–58). Hypogeusia observed after SARS-COV-2 infection could result from direct injury of the glossopharyngeal nerve and the vagus nerve by the virus (59). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect the olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium and then be transported into the CNS through the olfactory nerve. Reports using animal models of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats, have shown ACE2 expression in the nucleus of the solitary tract (60, 61), which points to the central cause of dysgeusia and a possible neuro-invasive route by continuous local or retrograde vagal axonal transport. Another report on the HCoV-OC43 showed the presence of structural viral material along axons in both ex vivo animal model of human coronaviruses (HCoV) neuropathogenesis and in vitro neuronal cell culture (62). Suggesting the use of the retrograde neuronal transport by HCoV-OC43 to facilitate locally the infection of neuronal cells from the olfactory nerve to the brain stem.",
            "In addition to a direct infection of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS, it is likely that numerous cases of neurological manifestations are indirect and most likely due to immune activation or hypoxia injury. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces excessive and sustained cytokine and chemokine responses, known as the cytokine storm. The proinflammatory state induced by the cytokine storm is characterized mainly by the dysregulated production of cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, that can trigger the development of virus induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or SIRS-like immune disorders (63). This phase of hyperinflammation may cause disruption of the BBB, activation of glial cells, demyelination and severe encephalopathy (64). Studies have demonstrated that high level expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, of IL-1β, interferon (IFN)-γ, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), TNF-α, and the chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) can correlate with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms (65–68). Several reports suggest that the high mortality of COVID-19 might be due to the hyperinflammation driven by SARS-CoV-2 (66, 69, 70). Hyperinflammation can also induce apoptosis of endothelial and epithelial cells, damaging the pulmonary microvascular and alveolar epithelial cell barriers and causing vascular leakage and alveolar edema, eventually leading to hypoxia in the body (68). Severe COVID-19 positive patients suffer from respiratory distress that leads to systemic hypoxemia. Hypoxic conditions caused by lung injury contributes to high neuro-susceptibility to COVID-19 (59). Therefore, it can be expected that patients with COVID-19 may develop seizures as a consequence of hypoxia, metabolic derangements, or organ failure (71). Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can induce CNS hypoxia that leads to an increase in anaerobic metabolism required to trigger neurological damages, such as demyelinating lesions (33). Hypoxic neurotoxicity and subsequent damages to the CNS can be observed without the direct presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain. Another study reported the occurrence of delirium in COVID-19 positive patients as a potentially early symptom of hypoxia associated with severe respiratory failure, or of an infectious spread to the CNS mediated by neuro-invasive mechanisms of the coronavirus (72). In conclusion, despite solid evidences of the neuro-invasive characteristics of human coronaviruses, the mechanism of neuro-invasion of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be established.",
            "Genomic similarities shared by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus, especially the human SARS-CoV have facilitated investigations of this novel virus. A bioinformatics analysis reported that the overall genome of SARS-CoV-2 shares 82% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV (73). The viral Spike protein, responsible for cell entry, contains two subunits, including the S1 and S2 subunit. Accordingly, the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 shares 99% amino acid homology with the S subunit derived from SARS-CoV. Whereas, the S1 subunit shares around 70% homology with SARS-CoV. The S1 subunit contains the N-terminal domain (NTD) and a receptor-binding domain (RBD), responsible for the direct binding of the virion to the host cellular ACE2 receptor (74). Once inside the CNS, SARS-CoV-2 can infect and trigger the activation of several brain cells. The most abundant cells in the brain are the astrocytes. They provide homeostasis and play an important role in the secretion of inflammatory molecules and neurotrophic factors (75–77). ACE2 receptors are expressed in brainstem and cerebellum astrocytes from rat (78), and may be a target for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brain. A recent study analyzed two biomarkers for CNS injury, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in the plasma of 47 patients with mild, moderate or severe COVID-19 (79). NfL is an axonal structural protein expressed in neurons that is released as a result of axonal injury and axonal neurodegeneration (80, 81), while GFAP is expressed in astrocytes and it is markedly upregulated in CNS injury and inflammation (82–84). Patients with severe COVID-19 had significantly higher concentrations of GFAP and NfL in plasma than controls, and GFAP was also increased in patients with moderate COVID-19. Interestingly, in the severe group, expression levels of plasma GFAP decreased from the initial to the last follow-up sampling, whereas NfL expression increased from initial to the last sampling. This study suggests that astrocytosis (astrocytes activation) could be a characteristic of moderate and severe stages of COVID-19, while neuronal injury may reflect the severe stages of the disease (79).",
            "Microglia are considered the prototypic tissue-resident macrophage-like innate immune cells of the CNS (85). They are involved in chemotaxis, phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and cytokine production, however, impaired or infected microglia contributes to the secretion of neuroinflammation and the process of neurodegeneration (86). Several studies have linked microglia activation and dysfunction with coronaviruses infection. A study investigated the role of microglia in responding to viral infection using mice infected with the neuro-attenuated rJ2.2 strain of the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Microglia were required at the earliest stages of infection to control viral replication and to increase host survival (87). While depletion of microglia resulted in a more rapid viral replication, increased infection of neurons, ineffective T cell responses, and evasion of the immune response by the virus. This study demonstrated that microglia have a critical role in the immune response to viral infection and protection from viral encephalitis. Another study determined that encephalitic murine coronavirus (MHV-A59) can be transmitted to the brain by intranasal or intracerebral contact, resulting in the activation of the innate immune system and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine by microglia and type I astrocytes (but not types II and III) (88). Suggesting that microglia and type I astrocytes form part of the CNS glymphatic system and mediate the innate immune reaction, specifically by the release of cytokines following an encephalitic coronavirus infection. It can be expected that the virus elicits distinctive tropism for each cell type in the brain. A report showed that two coronaviruses, the neurotropic virus (MHV-A59) and the non-neurotropic virus (MHV-2) infect astrocytes and microglia at the same titer in mice (89). However, cytokine mRNA profiles were different between astrocytes and microglia cultures. Infection with MHV-A59 increased the secretion of proinflammatory immune responses in astrocytes and microglia when compared to infection with MHV-2. These findings suggest that the neurovirulence of coronavirus is associated with the virus capacity to induce proinflammatory immune response by glia in the CNS.",
            "Prolonged cytokine signaling, as observed in COVID-19 pathology can induce cellular senescence. Senescent cells, characterized by sustained cell cycle arrest and the production of a distinct senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), such as cytokines and chemokines (90, 91), are commonly detected in neurodegenerative diseases. A study suggested the use of lithium, as a senolytic agent, to selectively induce apoptosis of senescent cells, as a potentially therapy to treat COVID-19 positive patients (92). They reported that low doses of lithium decreased the release of IL-6 and IL-8 and suppressed amyloid-β (Aβ) increased SA β-gal staining in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived astrocytes, all hallmarks of cellular senescence. IL-6 increase during the cytokine storm is often correlated to COVID-19 severity, suggesting that cellular senescence and the production of SASP as a potential mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 injury to the brain.",
            "As mentioned above, the autophagy pathway is necessary to remove aggregated or damaged cytoplasmic proteins and organelles. This pathway is constitutively active in the brain, and disruption of the pathway can affect the intercellular communication of axons, causing dendrites damage, loss of synapses, and consequently contributing to neurodegeneration (93–95). Autophagy is also involved in the removal of pathogens (Xenophagy) (96–98) and a key player in the replication of different genus of viruses and in the secretion of inflammatory molecules from glial cells (99–105). The replication of coronaviruses depends on the formation of replication complexes double-membrane vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (106, 107). Because the autophagy pathway also relies on ER-derived membranes for autophagosomes formation (108, 109), possible usage of the autophagy machinery by coronavirus to support viral replication has been suggested. A report showed the co-localization of SARS-CoV viral proteins with the endogenous protein marker of autophagosomes, LC3. Authors also suggested that SARS-CoV may use cellular autophagy to facilitate the formation of the replication complexes on double-membrane vesicles (110). On the other hand, a report showed no significant differences in SARS-CoV infection in mouse embryonic fibroblasts overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor from autophagy-deficient ATG5 knockout mice when compared to wild-type mice (111). To date, there are no reports available that link SARS-CoV-2 to the autophagy pathway in brain cells. A non-peer-reviewed preliminary report showed that SARS-CoV-2 reduced the autophagic flux and hampered autophagosome/lysosome fusion efficiency in bronchial epithelial cells NCI-H1299 and monkey kidney cells (VeroFM) in vitro, while the induction of autophagy reduced SARS-CoV-2 propagation in vitro (112). Although the exact role of autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and infection in the brain remains undetermined, the autophagy pathway regulates an effective inflammatory response and prevents prolonged hyperinflammation (113). Thus, suggesting that autophagy could play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection or in SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory response. More studies are needed to investigate the potential role of autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 pathology, specifically in cells from the CNS.",
            "Published reports validate that infection by SARS-CoV-2 is not solely confined to the lungs. Current evidence concurs that SARS-CoV-2 can impact the brain by direct and indirect injury. As investigations related to COVID-19 are still in progress, more studies should be conducted using pre-clinical animal models and clinical samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and autopsies of the COVID-19 victims. Furthermore, it is imperative to improve the timely evaluation of neurological symptoms and early analysis of the CSF in COVID-19 positive patients. Increased awareness of neurological complications related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial to improve the prognosis of severely ill patients. It is necessary to keep accurate registries and to follow-up with those affected and who have recovered from COVID-19. Monitoring the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS, including long-term psychological and neurocognitive implications is also necessary.",

            "The potential routes of SARS-CoV-2 neurological invasion. (1) SARS-CoV-2-containing droplets are deposited on the mucosa membranes through intranasal delivery, (2) Accordingly, the virus can infect the peripheral nervous system using the neuronal retrograde route until it reaches the brain. (3) SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors expressed on epithelial cells and enters the respiratory tract, (4) Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 can enter the bloodstream by the hematogenous route and (5) transmigrate the BBB through receptor (ACE2) binding transcytosis/endocytosis on the endothelial monolayers. Once SARS-CoV-2 reaches the brain, it can infect the brain cells, probably the astrocytes and microglia or can infect the neurons directly. SARS-CoV-2 can infect and activate both astrocytes and microglia causing a release virion, viral proteins, host-inflammatory molecules and other neurotoxins that cause neuronal damage and disease. Furthermore, infection with SARS-CoV-2 can indirectly trigger neurological injury through an exaggerated immune response and by the hypoxic environment caused by respiratory distress.",

            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a human coronavirus (HCoV) that has created a pandemic situation worldwide as COVID-19. This virus can invade human cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-based mechanisms, affecting the human respiratory tract. However, several reports of neurological symptoms suggest a neuroinvasive development of coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 can damage the brain via several routes, along with direct neural cell infection with the coronavirus. The chronic inflammatory reactions surge the brain with proinflammatory elements, damaging the neural cells, causing brain ischemia associated with other health issues. SARS-CoV-2 exhibited neuropsychiatric and neurological manifestations, including cognitive impairment, depression, dizziness, delirium, and disturbed sleep. These symptoms show nervous tissue damage that enhances the occurrence of neurodegenerative disorders and aids dementia. SARS-CoV-2 has been seen in brain necropsy and isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of COVID-19 patients. The associated inflammatory reaction in some COVID-19 patients has increased proinflammatory cytokines, which have been investigated as a prognostic factor. Therefore, the immunogenic changes observed in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's patients include their pathogenetic role. Inflammatory events have been an important pathophysiological feature of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The neuroinflammation observed in AD has exacerbated the Aβ burden and tau hyperphosphorylation. The resident microglia and other immune cells are responsible for the enhanced burden of Aβ and subsequently mediate tau phosphorylation and ultimately disease progression. Similarly, neuroinflammation also plays a key role in the progression of PD. Several studies have demonstrated an interplay between neuroinflammation and pathogenic mechanisms of PD. The dynamic proinflammation stage guides the accumulation of α-synuclein and neurodegenerative progression. Besides, few viruses may have a role as stimulators and generate a cross-autoimmune response for α-synuclein. Hence, neurological complications in patients suffering from COVID-19 cannot be ruled out. In this review article, our primary focus is on discussing the neuroinvasive effect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, its impact on the blood-brain barrier, and ultimately its impact on the people affected with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.",
            "The SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), pandemic has made the daily lives of people all across the world challenging with a significant family burden. Millions of people have lost their lives, and the number is increasing day by day [1]. Both economy and health have been seriously affected as a result of this pandemic [2, 3]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the strain of coronavirus that has caused this COVID-19 pandemic [4–6]. This pandemic's global lockdown has resulted in severe psychological and mental stress among children and adolescents [7, 8]. Mental and psychological health is very important to maintain homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS) [9]. This pandemic has led to a disturbance in the homeostasis of the CNS by affecting the cytokine concentrations and may be responsible for the initiation of many neurodegenerative diseases [10, 11]. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is mainly responsible for preventing harmful substances from entering the CNS [12–14]. COVID-19 also causes harmful changes in the permeability of the BBB [15]. The spike in SARS-CoV-2 is mainly responsible for the alteration in the permeability of the human BBB, as suggested by 2D static and 3D microfluidic in vitro models [16]. Consequently, altered permeability and integrity cause the BBB to be more prone to developing different neurological and neuroinflammatory diseases in the CNS [13, 14]. Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the two most common neurodegenerative diseases found all over the world that share almost similar mechanisms of progression [17, 18].",
            "The research studies focusing on delineating the relationship between coronavirus disease and neurodegenerative disorders have provided conflicting results. Thus, a clear causal link could not be established. However, several mechanisms have been proposed by which COVID-19 might contribute to the development of PD and AD, such as the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-19 which might trigger neuroinflammation and eventually lead to neurodegeneration. Several studies have found significantly high levels of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 in COVID-19 patients [19]. Similarly, earlier studies on Parkinson's disease have correlated high plasma IL-6 concentration with an increased risk of PD development [20]. Therefore, an increased possibility of neuroinflammation due to cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 cannot be ruled out.",
            "The meta-analysis of the Parkinson's disease gut microbiome suggested alterations linked to intestinal inflammation [21]. As revealed by various studies, the development of PD is also linked to the gut microbiome and its dysbiosis [21, 22]. In a study, SARS-CoV-2 imbalanced the gut microbiome (dysbiosis) and intestinal inflammation indicated by elevated fecal calprotectin in COVID. Similarly, cognitive decline was observed during acute covid infection, but cognitive impairment was also observed post COVID [23, 24].",
            "Medicinal plants like Mucuna pruriens, Withania somnifera, and Tinospora cordifolia and their active components like ursolic acid and chlorogenic acid, which are very beneficial for PD and AD, also show significant therapeutic activity in the management of COVID-19 patients. Recent data suggest that these plants and their bioactive components play a very crucial role in the clinical and preclinical studies for the management of COVID-19 patients [25–31]. Researchers are also working on the derivatives of the medicinal plants and their bioactive components to investigate their possible interaction among COVID-19 patients and in animal models. In this review, we present the viewpoint on the effect of COVID-19 on permeability of the blood-brain barrier. Then, we discussed the effect of this pandemic on PD and AD neurotropism, neuropathology, and neuroinflammation in a sequential manner. We have also discussed the infection and mortality rate among AD- and PD-related dementia.",
            "The microvascular endothelial cells can form a blood-brain barrier and cover the central nervous system from heterogenic microorganisms and toxins present in the blood [32]. These cells express tight-junction proteins that prevent adjacent cell movement [33]. However, several identified viruses that can disrupt the blood-brain barrier are the Zika virus, West Nile virus, and the arbovirus [34, 35]. Several experimental procedures conducted using in vivo and in vitro BBB models have determined that these viruses can replicate in the brain's microvascular endothelial cells and stimulate tight-junction protein degradation and downregulation leading to BBB disruption [34, 36]. Likewise, Bleau et al. demonstrated the penetration ability of the coronaviruses in the CNS via the extreme hepatotropic mouse hepatitis type 3 virus and a weakly typed A59 hepatotropic hepatitis mouse. The infected mice type 3 have brain invasion related to increased BBB permeability.",
            "The impact was linked with an induced level of zona occludens protein 1 expression, occluding, and VE-cadherin [37]. Considering the molecular relatedness of coronaviruses in their replication mode to infect the brain's microvascular endothelial cells, it was determined that other kinds of coronaviruses can also use similar activity pathways to do the same [38]. Significantly, CoV's existence has been recognized in the microvascular endothelial cells (brain) of the frontal lobe tissues, obtained from the postmortem examination of COVID-19 patients [39]. Also, a viral particle and CoV genomic content have been identified in the brain's neuronal cytoplasm, particularly in the region of the cortex and hypothalamus [40]. Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can cross the BBB accompanied by basement membrane disruption [41], and in another study, the S1 subunit of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was found to cross the blood-brain barrier by adsorptive transcytosis and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was involved in its brain and lung uptake [42]. Hence, the infection via various respiratory viruses and SARS-CoV-2 may disturb the BBB integrity via distinct mechanisms. The viral particles can directly cause cellular stress associated with cytotoxic effects, which may lead to the disruption of the infected cell; for example, coronaviruses can stimulate cell apoptosis [43]. However, the activation of endothelial cells of the inflammatory reactions can increase protease expression, such as matrix metalloproteinase, promoting tight-junction protein degradation [44]. This evidence suggests that inflammatory responses probably play a significant role in stimulating BBB disruption.",
            "The coronaviruses can be a source of BBB damage via the activation of inflammatory reactions linked with the dysregulation of these mechanisms [45]. Likewise, the stimulation of microvascular endothelial cells is associated with changes in the permeability of the BBB. For example, in the physiological state, the immune cell displacement into the CNS is precisely managed through processes conducted at the BBB stage [46]. Interestingly, the circulation of immune cells to the CNS is deficient and restricted to the particular immune subsets (innate and adaptive immune cell subsets), such as antigen-presenting cells, like dendritic cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes, which can manage the immune control in the CNS [47]. At the time of viral infection, the level of immune cell migration is increased. Therefore, it can be concluded that the enhanced CNS inflammatory reaction and systemic inflammation resulting from a viral infection may trigger the integrity of BBB and further progress into neurodegenerative disorders. These mechanisms may be supported via a histopathologic examination of the brain tissue in people with a SARS-CoV condition, where CD3+ T lymphocyte and CD68+ monocyte/macrophage pathological infiltration was found in the mesenchymal cells of the human brain [48].",
            "Moreover, the process of infiltration is associated with the interaction of β1 and β2 integrins, which have an expression on leukocytes and their ligands, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, ICAM-2) [49]. The ICAM and VCAM-1 are present on the microendothelial cell surfaces that stimulate the extravasation over the BBB; inflammatory responses have been cited. The activation and infection of microvascular endothelial cells via the typical neurotrophic viruses may increase the endothelial adhesion molecules [36]. This mechanism promotes viral infected immune cell trafficking to the CNS via a “Trojan horse” [50]. However, at the time of viral replication in the host cells, the impairment may be created due to SARS-CoV-2 (cytoplasmic virus), which stimulates the discharge of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [51]. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are endogenous compounds released through impaired cells that interact with a pattern-recognition receptor (PRR), which stimulates the endothelial cells, neighboring epithelial cells like macrophages, and a high inflammatory condition. Once the viral-host cell interaction has been accomplished, the viral protein and genomes can also be identified through PPRs that induce an immune cell response [52].",
            "Distinct PPRs can identify SARS-CoV-2, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), expressed in various cell lines along with macrophages, endothelial cells, and dendritic cells. The TLRs (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) stimulate different activation pathways that provide the proinflammatory cytokines and other antiviral drug molecules in controlling the infection. Therefore, this reaction can be exacerbated and dysregulate cytokine production [53]. The other PPRs and NOD-like receptors (NLR) may induce the inflammasome complex and stimulate the activation state in a few cells: the epithelial, macrophage, and microvascular endothelial cells may lead to the overproduction of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 [54]. However, these processes need to be examined in detail for novel coronaviruses. Evidence suggests that viral RNA can stimulate the typical melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (antiviral state) and retinoic acid-inducible gene 1, into which interferons (IFN) release IFN types I and III. Interferons are important molecules that help prevent viral infection by stopping viral replication [55].",
            "COVID-19 patients having high IFN levels, mainly IFN I, have been recognized; these molecules avoid replicating viruses from the adjacent cells. They impact the viral infection, that is, the activation of interferon-stimulated gene expression, cytokine production, and induction of immunoreactive cells (monocyte, macrophages, and neutrophils) [56]. Likewise, the other coronaviruses may have a similar pattern of responses. Moreover, COVID-19 patients have an enhanced level of chemokines and cytokines, such as interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [57]. Interestingly, an increased level of IL-6 is associated with a poor prognosis for SARS-CoV-2 [58]. The overproduction and imbalanced amount of the existing molecules may be defined as a cytokine storm, significantly creating BBB disruption. The cytokine storm stimulates the induction of macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, and platelets; few of these molecules may be associated with coagulation and complement systems and involved in pathogenic inflammatory responses. Few chemokines might attract some innate immune response cells: natural killer cells, monocytes, T cells, and dendritic cells. It activates the production of other kinds of cytokines, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and IL-10, which help in the recruitment of monocytes and lymphocytes and initialize the humoral cell response [59]. These processes can contribute to the severity of the neurological manifestation of COVID-19 infection in the BBB. SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with overinflammatory alteration may lead to excessive thrombin production that prevents fibrinolysis and induces complement pathways. This reaction leads to microthrombin deposition, thrombin inflammatory reaction, and microvascular dysfunction, related to the impaired BBB [60]. The undetermined processes that can aid the damage in the BBB are adaptive immune reactions. The antibody (Ab) generation across COVID-19 can react with a few brain microvascular endothelial cells and be disrupted via activation of the complement system (C3 and C4 proteins). Besides, the AB-based enrichment phenomenon may enhance the contribution and infection to the damage. This mechanism has been extensively used in Zika and Dengue viral infections, where the antibodies produced in the primary exposure cross-react with the second exposure and increase the rate of disease rather than neutralizing it [61].",
            "The current pandemic COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a severe health crisis worldwide and led to a global virtual deadlock [62]. Even though significant preventive steps have been taken as a complete lockdown of economic and social life, social distancing has become a severe health problem for people with Parkinson's disease (PD) [63, 64]. Increased evidence determines the oxidative stress involvement that develops NF-κB in COVID-19 [65].",
            "The effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on PD patients has been extensively discussed by several researchers worldwide. The potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 illness on PD patients is still unknown; thus, there is a shortage of scientific studies. Nevertheless, the pandemic situation has resulted in an emphasis on psychological factors. Considering the standard features, which show an essential role in PD, oxidative stress may worsen PD progression in COVID-19 patients and vice versa. Therefore, the pathophysiology of PD may put the individuals at a high risk of severe stress and lead to one of the several unseen miseries of the COVID-19 epidemic. The enhanced stress during a pandemic may have various adverse short- and long-term effects on PD individuals [66].",
            "On the one hand, enhanced psychological stress can disrupt several motor functions, such as dyskinesias and tremors, if it decreases the potency of the dopaminergic drugs [67, 68]. On the other hand, enhanced stress may also reveal the potency of the hypokinetic rigid syndrome, probably through a decreased remunerative system [69]. It could lead to an improved PD diagnosis level throughout the epidemic as various animal trials reveal that prolonged exposure to severe stress may lead to loss of dopaminergic cells in response to a toxin [70–73]. Besides, this pandemic has resulted in reduced physical activities due to complete lockdown and social distancing; as a result, people have not been able to do physical work [74]. Current studies provide evidence that physical exercises may reduce the clinical features of PD progression [75, 76]. A more rigorous workout was linked with a better outcome than a moderately intense workout [77]. The fundamental mechanisms are still unknown, but it is beneficial to note that reduced physical activity during the COVID-19 epidemic may lead to worse motor symptoms in PD individuals. It has also contributed to enhanced psychological stress, another exasperating indication of PD [78]. Likewise, it also leads to severe non-motor issues such as constipation or insomnia, because of reduced physical activeness [79]. Simultaneous evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic will severely impact individuals having neurodegenerative disorders as they have enhanced exposure to negative consequences of decreased physical activity and increased stress. Moreover, both melancholies can aggravate their motor as well as non-motor manifestations. These pandemic situations work as stressors aligned in time for such individuals [65, 80, 81]. It provides novel events for health professionals to analyze how the current pandemic directed PD progression in the present longitudinal discipline by taking biological biomarkers' assets. It also allows healthcare professionals to test which factors can protect the patients from the adverse impact of this catastrophe, by adding PD resilience. In essence, the current detrimental situations will also bring long-term positive consequences for several individuals with PD globally.",
            "The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes significant concern for people who have already suffered from PD. Chaudhry et al. revealed the evidence of the impact of COVID-19 on PD patients [65]. They discovered that both COVID-19 infection and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced toxicity prompted caspase-2, 3, and 8 stimulation through the NF-κB pathway culminating in the death of dopamine-containing neurons (dDCNs) [65]. Their findings prove that SARS-CoV-2 and PD might have common inflammatory pathways beneath the oxidative stress, as they have the essential indulgence of NF-κB. Although it has a clear correlation with oxidative stress biomarkers and the chronicity of viral infections, such as hepatitis C, the SARS-CoV's clinical data is limited [82]. Therefore, in the presymptomatic situation, several facts suggest that surplus reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impoverished antioxidant systems play a significant role in the pathologic process of COVID-19 infection and lung infection progression [83].",
            "The animal trial of the COVID-19 disease has shown an increased ROS level and disturbed antioxidant defensive mechanisms during the SARS-CoV-2 infection [38]. The healthcare professionals suggested that the onset of chronic lung injury in a COVID-19 condition may depend on the stimulating oxidative-stress machinery associated with innate immunity, which may induce transcription factor NF-κB, resulting in aggravated proinflammatory host behavior [84, 85].",
            "The coronavirus has been shown to spur caspase-based apoptosis required for the viral replication process [86]. According to various literature surveys, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway induced via a collection of viruses helps in establishing a chronic infection, by delaying apoptosis in virus-infected cells, thus helping to complete the virus life cycle [87]. Accordingly, PI3K/Akt signaling may be a potential target against this COVID-19 pandemic and should be seriously considered. In addition, the role of oxidative stress, JNK, Akt, p38, and NF-κB signal pathways has also been proven in influenza A virus (IAV)-induced acute lung injury; thus, these can also act as possible biomarkers in COVID-19-induced lung injuries [88]. The oxidative stress, such as IAV-mediated TLR4 and NF-κB signaling pathways, may trigger SARS-CoV, increasing the host inflammatory reaction and leading to acute lung injury. Several studies have delineated the role of oxidative stress-mediated TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6 signaling pathways as an inflammatory response pathologic pathway that induces the implacability of chronic lung injury. The oxidative phospholipid is generated through the overproduction of lung macrophage-stimulated cytokines and leads to lung injury by TLR4-TRIF [89].",
            "These oxidative phospholipids have also been recognized in animal and human lungs infected with the COVID-19 virus [90]. As is evident from these studies, a research focus should be kept on oxidative stress, as it might be the connecting link between the COVID-19 pandemic and neurodegenerative disorders. Similarly, in another study, upregulation of mitochondrial genes was also determined. These genes responded to oxidative stress, in the isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of recovered SARS-CoV patients [91]. Some of the genes included, such as FOS, FTH1, and PRDX1, have precise oxidative stress and provide remarkable ascent. The results suggest evidence of an association between inflammation, oxidative stress, and the pathogenic process of the COVID-19 infection. The virus infection has always been treated as a predisposing factor for developing PD and long-term neuron loss.",
            "Several studies have shown the impact of dysfunctional mitochondria, mitochondrial gene upregulation, and the genes that respond to oxidative stress (an essential feature of neurodegenerative disorders) in cells recovered from COVID-19 patients. A COVID-19 study revealed the production of proinflammatory cytokines (CXCL-8, IL-6, CCL20, CCL3, CCL4, and IL-12) by dysfunctional mitochondria [41, 45, 92]. Among these proinflammatory cytokines, chemo-attractants, such as CXCL-8, promote neutrophil infiltration, thus contributing to ROS generation and protease activation that further contribute to damaged mitochondria [93].",
            "Similarly, the consideration has kept on COVID-19 infection due to induction of a marked fundamental proinflammatory reaction. An eventual case-control analysis revealed that males with a high plasma IL-6 concentration have an increased risk of developing PD [94]. It is already known that SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through TMPRSS2 and ACE2 [95]. Likewise, when compared with untreated rats, the TMPRSS2 expression was upregulated in rats treated with 6-hydroxydopamine, which is extensively used as a tool to model PD [96]. This examining procedure demonstrates that genes may codify, as these proteins are differentially regulated and crucial in disease development. Interestingly, in the past, coronaviruses have been associated with PD individuals. Significantly, intravenous antibodies for coronavirus types, MHV-A59, and MHV-JHM are increased in PD individuals, compared to people with other neurological disorders [97].",
            "However, the influential role of viral infection in PD patients is still not known. Hence, a long investigating period of post-COVID-19 patients is required, but some characteristics of the chronic phase of this disease are very distinct. For example, a prior detection of gastrointestinal problems and anosmia and a high predominance of reduced recognition are identified in more chronic phases [98]. It is believed that the neurotropic pattern of the COVID virus is related to its activity, which produces respiratory symptoms, with approximately 89% of the people in intensive care units not being able to breathe voluntarily. Apparently, this is caused by a central dysfunction [99, 100]. However, gastrointestinal problems and hyposmia are the common non-motor symptoms in PD individuals during the prodromal stage; this is when neurodegeneration has been initiated [101]. Based on Braak's hypothesis, these indications suggest that it is the beginning phase of PD progression, which entails α-synuclein deposition in the anterior olfactory nucleus region and dorsal motor region. Most coronaviruses share similar viral anatomy, infection mechanism, and pathogenic processes. The viral penetration in the host cells is induced through dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [100]. Furthermore, human SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause chronic neurological difficulty with refractory status epilepticus, seizures, encephalomyelitis, encephalitis, leukoencephalopathy, cerebellitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and severe neuromyopathy. Evidence suggests that neurotropism and neuroinvasion are common manifestations of coronaviruses [102].",
            "Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can infect cells via associating its spike proteins and the ACE2 receptor. For interacting like this, the spike protein must be cleaved through the transmembrane serine protease enzyme. The cells expressing both TMPRSS2 and ACE2 receptors are more affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection [103]. Chen et al. revealed the expression of ACE2 by examining the information obtained from the brain transcriptome database. These receptors are overexpressed in SN and brain ventricles, scattered in excitatory and preventive neurons, and present in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes [104]. Besides, there is no strong evidence for the co-expressive mechanism of ACE2/TMPRSS2 in the brain region. Brann et al. revealed that the non-neurological sensory olfactory epithelium cells such as Bowman's gland cells, horizontal basal cells, and sustentacular cells express both TMPRSS2 and ACE2 receptors [105].",
            "Hence, these cells may be the primary ones to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, these non-neuronal cells can support the developed olfactory sensory neurons of the sensory epithelium. Supportive cells can be influenced by HCoV, sequentially transmitting the virus to the olfactory sensory neurons via axonal transport after those invading neurons in the olfactory bulb and then spreading to the CNS, where they cause inflammation [106]. The process of viral invasion by the olfactory bulb to the brain has already been reported to show a role in neurodegenerative disorder. It may trigger pathological aggregated protein transmission in a prion-like manner [107]. In the case of a retrospective study of COVID-19-infected individuals hospitalized in Wuhan, China, the researchers have found that out of 214 patients, 78 may have neurologic symptoms, defective memory, and cerebrovascular disorder occurrence in the more acute cases [98]. Dysgeusia and anosmia are also commonly reported in COVID-19 patients [108]. These investigations support the speculation that SARS-CoVs like coronaviruses can infect human brain cells.",
            "The substantia nigra and cortex are the brain regions having a high risk of HCoV penetration through an ACE2 receptor. Often, this is the exact correlation in a neurodegenerative disorder and must not be taken as only a coincidence [39]. Lippi et al. have hypothesized the significant role of coronaviruses in the future development of neurological disorders, particularly in PD [109]. The author has hypothesized a new model for the neurodegenerative disease, as coronaviruses can promote α-synuclein accumulation, which is a significant element of Lewy bodies in the human brain, as has been suggested (Figure 1). The author focused on cellular pathways infected through the SARS-CoV-2 virus (proteostasis) to explain the phenomenon [109]. It is precise in providing efficient equilibrium and activates stress-induced mechanisms, which appear to be the same targets in neurodegeneration. Evidence has suggested that the infection of H1N1 of dopaminergic cells may result in the formation of α-synuclein aggregates and not of any other distinct protein recommended to focus on this mechanism positively. Therefore, in vitro models that determine the triggering changes in proteostasis may lead to the persistence of toxic impenetrable proteins [110]. These findings demonstrate that coronavirus infection may alter the PD neurodegeneration through progressive aging in brain cells or tissues (Figure 1).",
            "SARS-CoV-2 has been recognized in brain autopsies and extracted from the cerebrospinal fluid of COVID-19-infected patients [111–113]. Currently, there are at least two well-developed facts about the association between neurodegenerative disorder and COVID-19, particularly for PD. On the one hand, there is a presence of antibodies against HCoV in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients who have already suffered from PD [97]. On the other hand, the second evidence suggests the penetration of the virus in the brain via the nasal cavity, which causes anosmia and hyposmia [114]. It has been reported that hyposmia is a common premotor characteristic of PD and the olfactory bulb is a chosen target for the deposition of α-synuclein pathogenicity [115]. The role of neurotropic virus pathogenicity in a neurodegenerative disorder can selectively target the basal ganglionic cells. Furthermore, few researchers also demonstrate that the longevity of the viruses in the nervous system infected cells for a longer time.",
            "Donadio and coworkers state that the primary community depends on case-control analysis that describes the impact of symptomatic SARS-CoV infection on the motor or non-motor manifestation. In their group, 141 people who already had PD, in Lombardy, where there were 12 SARS-CoV-2-infected cases, had a mean age and course of disease duration similar to the controls [116]. The PD individuals may experience substantial damage to both motor and non-motor manifestations (mainly fatigue and urinary disorder) during the period of mild-to-tolerable COVID-19 infection, explicitly of aging and disease duration (Figure 1). Commonly, fatigue is reported as a dominant non-motor symptom during the COVID-19 infection in PD cases [114].",
            "Comparatively, cognitive features were imperceptibly indulged; hence, none of them experienced autonomic damage. Medical disturbance can be observed in PD patients. It can be explained via infection-based mechanisms and damaged pharmacokinetics of dopaminergic treatment, requiring therapy adjustments in one-third of the cases [116]. The SARS-CoV-2 infection in PD patients cannot be limited to motor symptoms due to the incidental impact of the more prolonged exposure under lockdown, causing self-isolation, increased stress, and anxiety that should be considered. A current Iranian cross-sectional, case-control study evaluated the anxiety level among PD patients as compared to caretakers and familiar individuals. The occurrence of anxiety has been investigated in PD patient groups, who followed through with their caregivers [117]. Evidence suggests that the researchers have also demonstrated a strong association between severe anxiety in PD individuals and fear of having COVID-19 infection [117]. However, the other significant consequences of COVID-19 conditions are concerns about the considerable reduction in health activity.",
            "The impact of reduced physical activity must not be neglected, as it may attenuate the progression of the medical symptoms in PD individuals. This evidence has been investigated by Shalash et al., who have determined the effects of COVID-19 on mental health, physical activeness, and quality of life in PD individuals. PD individuals harm their health care, cognitive ability, and interest in social life compared to PD controls [118]. Besides, Prasad et al. have demonstrated the implications and perceptions of SARS-CoV-2 infection in around 100 Indian PD individuals and their caretakers, which proved to have damaged the mental ability, physical wellness, and quality of life of these individuals [119]. This analysis may also shed light on the significance of managing these conditions preceding PD patients' care, specifically via taking telemedicine. It is not surprising to see PD individuals having impaired mental health during the lockdown. The immediate changes commonly need a flexible adjustment to new assets; these situations are strongly associated with the regular dopaminergic activity. Likewise, PD patients have experienced cognitive inability resulting in nigrostriatal dopaminergic depletion, which makes up the pathophysiologic substrate of PD [120]. To complicate this precarious situation of COVID-19 coexistence, there is less access to routine visits to hospitals to preserve PD patients from infection. Therefore, in the new era, taking care of patients has significantly changed, the most challenging concept for clinicians, as it has reinvented the work processes such as telemedicine, including digital visits, simple telephone consultations, and mail or text messages. As we advance in this direction, Goetz et al. accessed the validity and reliability of virtual-based MDS Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale examination for comparing to official work. The E-Rehabilitation scheme can include virtual improvement programs as alternative strategies to deliver rehabilitation at a considerable level, which must be appreciated [121]. Although the telemedicine strategies are not well established universally, superior to the quality of regular in-person visits, evidence suggests that it associates with comparable results and can offer an excellent service and efficiency to PD patients. In short, the COVID-19 infection can complicate the PD clinical course, resulting from the severity of motor and non-motor manifestations, increasing stress and anxiety, and affecting the quality of life and mental wellness. In the era of COVID-19, telemedicine has played a significant role. Finally, various longitudinal and cross-sectional studies are required to find a causal association between clinical and severity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, sequential inflammatory reactions having cytokine levels, and via identification in the CSF of PD individuals.",
            "In our senior community, dementia is associated with a pandemic situation. However, the administration in the COVID-19 pandemic situation may also bring us more concerns [122]. The first concern is combining two potent risk factors, aging and dementia, for fatalities in COVID-19-infected patients. Likewise, the second concern is about the effect of associated coronavirus outbreak and dementia and the consequences of social distancing on the mental health of these weak patients, which needed a better prognosis [123].  Table 1 shows the global burden and mortality of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, population, age, structure, and COVID-19. Results are classified according to (A) global burden of disease super-region classification and (B) World Bank income level-based classification. Similarly, Figure 2 exhibits a scatter plot between Alzheimer's disease and other dementia disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates. It shows the total number of COVID-19 cases per million and the total number of COVID-19 deaths per million.",
            "It is well understood that aged people are at high risk for fatalities after COVID-19 infection [124]. Very little data is available on older individuals infected with COVID-19, and limited reports have concentrated on above 80 individuals [125]. All of this has been demonstrated among older individuals having no dementia. Covino et al. provided results among dementia individuals having COVID-19 infection. Their results from this retrospect, single-centered, and observational examination in a Central Italy referral center for COVID-19 determine that the death risk does not depend on age [126].",
            "In contrast, acute dementia itself might be a prominent risk factor among these individuals. Based on this evidence, Bianchetti et al. have determined the predominance, clinical representation, and results of individuals with dementia among those admitted in the hospitals with a COVID-19 condition [127]. Data obtained from 627 patients hospitalized in the Acute Hospital in Brescia province, Northern Italy, were examined retrospectively. Compared to people without dementia, patients with dementia have shown a high mortality rate of up to 40% [127]. Combining this investigation on dementia, mainly with the late onset of disease, may significantly risk fatality in corona patients. The neurological disease modification and care scheme are more vulnerable in AD patients due to neurological damage and a high neuropsychiatric symptomatology rate. This has been specifically proven at the stage of the compassionate outbreak that is SARS-CoV-2 infectious condition. Around 80% of AD individuals may show at least one or two neuropsychiatric manifestations throughout the infection. These factors are flexible and appear more progressive in AD, even if there may be early symptoms of prodromal stages. The neuropsychiatric manifestations of the AD medical spectrum include anxiety, depression, agitation, and emerging apathy, being exposed as frequent damages [128]. However, it is also considered being the effect of factors such as the enhanced rate of AD progression, altering meditational responses and reducing the patients' life quality. During the COVID-19 outbreak, for the first time, Boutoleau-Bretonniere et al. provided evidence of the impact of detention on the neuropsychiatric manifestation among AD individuals. The results suggest that only 30% of AD patients displayed neuropsychiatric alterations during the period of confinement. The confining period is significantly associated with their symptom severity and their caretaker's afflictions. The restrictions can worsen neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD patients, whereas no such manifestations were stimulated in people having more conserved cognition [129].",
            "Other authors determined the severity of neuropsychiatric manifestations of agitation and impaired motor function, as the most affected indication among AD and MCI, during the complete lockdown during this COVID pandemic [130, 131]. The classic symptoms of AD patients with COVID-19 infection such as dyspnea, fever, and cough were less usual, while they specifically experienced drowsiness and diarrhea. Finally, that delirium can cause hypoxia, which is a prominent feature of COVID-19 infection and it can complicate the representation of dementia, although it is needed for dementia support and care [127]. However, these investigations can confirm the medical spectrum's anticipated risk, mainly the neuropsychiatric manifestations during the epidemic in AD individuals.",
            "Despite having a long-term association between HCoV and its impact on the brain, it is not well understood; its efficient role in future neurodegeneration can be significant in AD research. Chronic results after the infection of COVID-19, often linked with the cytokine storm of distinct inflammatory responses, trigger enhanced proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and IL-6) [132]. In the case of AD patients, amyloid stimulates type I interferon (IFN) response; hence, it can create a perfect storm [133]. IFNs have an important role in AD pathology, thereby indicating nucleic acid containing amyloid fibrils stimulating the expression of genes responsible for IFN production. Microglia get activated by IFN, which gets associated with the nucleic acid-containing amyloid plaques, thus stimulating a proinflammatory response. IFN further activates complement cascade and leads to synapse degeneration (Figure 3).",
            "It explains one of the questions that arise from presymptomatic individuals with undetected AD, who may see the stimulation of symptoms due to systemic inflammatory responses resulting from viral infection. Besides, several researchers have deliberated that infected people may have a high risk of impaired cognition after recovering from primary SARS-CoV-2 illness. The condition may directly negatively impact immune responses, and it also accelerates the preexisting cognitive deficiency and de novo stimulation of a neurodegenerative disorder. Based on the suggested evidence, it is possible to hypothesize that they may be at a high risk of generating neurodegenerative symptoms, which are unmasked via silent COVID-19 infection in the brain.",
            "The clinical features of COVID-infected patients are under great study. Globally, there have been 550 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 6.3 million deaths, reported as per WHO [134]. As of 11 July 2022, 12,130,881,147 vaccine doses have been administered. Therefore, it is crucial to scrutinize the risk condition of COVID-19-infected patients and their deaths. The lead factors affecting the enhanced transmission rate and medical severity remain unclear. The patients are suffering from other medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and respiratory pathologies, and the elders especially are highly prone to the virus.",
            "It is reported that age is a crucial risk factor for the SARS-CoVs-2 mortality rate. Age is the predominant feature of neurodegenerative diseases among older people. Thus, it is significant to analyze Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease in SARS-CoV-2 infection [135]. SARS-CoV-2 is hazardous to older individuals with illness and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, there is no proven evidence regarding the enhanced risk of COVID-19 for PD. Besides, severe PD symptoms associated with anxiety are often seen during the pandemic. PD patients, especially those who receive advanced therapy (brain stimulation or levodopa immersion), having a high fatality rate (40%–50%) [99]. In the case of patients with neurodegenerative disease, they are severely hampered by SARS-CoV-2 infection and require admission to the hospital (ICU) [136]. As previously mentioned, PD patients may have respiratory complications due to respiratory muscle bradykinin rigidity and dystonia, which can make life more challenging. Ingestion may also negatively impact these individuals, where saliva may pool in their mouth and cause breathing problems, which can complicate the management of COVID-19 patients. Even though no proven evidence supports the association of NDs with COVID-19 patients, it is examined worldwide as a future retrospective analysis concerning the clinical care strategy for ND patients admitted in the ICU. There are no current clinical guidelines. Therefore, an attempt should be made to ensure PD and AD patients continue to receive anti-PD and anti-AD therapy. For pneumonia patients on supporting previous PD treatment medicine, an equivalent levodopa dose is significant for avoiding muscle bradykinin rigidity and impaired breathing due to dopaminergic withdrawal. The apomorphine pump therapy and levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel therapy on patients should be continued if it has already been implemented.",
            "In some cases, PD medications should be adapted in hospitals, like severe kinetic individuals having dysplasia symptoms, where oral drug administration is no longer viable [136]. The easiest and cost-effective method to administer levodopa solution to patients is via a nasogastric tube. Initially, the apomorphic pump is not advisable to be used on patients in the ICU; however, they can be examined only if akinesia constitutes chronic effects. Likewise, another medicine that is trending is transdermal rotigotine, considerably less effective than apomorphine/levodopa. Until now, there is no strategic guideline to dictate an alternative therapy for ND patients in hospitals; it may be regulated using the clinical teams' experiences on a case-by-case basis [136].",
            "The SARS-CoV-2 infection can drastically change the usual routine of PD patients through a lockdown and social distancing worldwide. Thus, many AD and PD patients experience a negative impact on their mental health due to prolonged lockdown (Figure 4). There are several reports which describe that the symptoms of AD and PD patients became worse and they have developed depressive and anxious symptoms, affecting their quality of life, compared to matched controls, during the epidemic. However, a detailed explanation is that the PD and AD pathophysiology naturally enhances the risk of severe depressive disorder, as decreasing dopamine levels reduce the stress-coping mechanisms. Currently, the data suggest that older individuals with concurrent medical problems (such as diabetes and hypertension) and patients having dementia are associated with an enhanced risk of COVID-19 and a high mortality rate. Thus, health-related interventions such as lockdown and social distancing have severely affected AD and PD patients' well-being (Figure 4). Social distancing is crucial for preventing COVID-19 infection and also in protecting at-risk populations such as older individuals with high mortality risk from SARS-CoV-2 condition [129]. Likewise, in India, elder individuals account for up to 104 million of the total population. The number of individuals living with Alzheimer's or dementia in India has been evaluated as 5.29 million (prediction for 2020) by the Alzheimer's and Related Disorders Society of India [137]. The effect of the epidemic on the symptoms of older individuals and patients with dementia is of grave concern to the healthcare professionals and dementia support organizations in the country. It is problematic, as stress has short- and long-term negative impacts on AD and PD patients. It has shown that cognitive stress can impair motor symptoms such as dyskinesia, tremor, and gait. Due to stress, the impact of the dopaminergic medications may also reduce, like the effect of levodopa on PD tremors [138].",
            "It is significant to consider that physical workouts can impair PD progression and related stress. Moreover, social distancing during an epidemic significantly decreases mobility and physical activity, leading to a sedentary lifestyle. Accordingly, regular home-based exercise such as online classes for AD and PD patients is substantial for maintaining their overall health quality during COVID-19 [139].",
            "In human and animal models, SARS-CoV-2 can enter the brain along the brainstem precisely via the olfactory nerves and without any initial respiratory involvement [140]. The COVID-19 infection develops when the viral glycoprotein spikes get associated with ACE2 receptors. The ACE2 receptors are ubiquitously present in the human brain, not only in the medulla's cardiorespiratory centers but also in the striatum (dopamine neurons) [141]. However, two well-integrated pieces of evidence associate SARS-CoV-2 infection with movement disorder, particularly for PD. The first evidence, from over two decades ago, explains that antibodies exist against coronavirus in the CSF of PD patients [97]. Likewise, the second piece of evidence demonstrates the entrance of coronavirus into the brain via the nasal cavity, causing anosmia or hyposmia. It has been reported that hyposmia is a well-known premotor feature of PD. The olfactory bulb is the optimized target for alpha-synuclein pathologic deposition, which may be more than just fate [142].",
            "The glial cells (astrocyte and microglia) play a vital role in maintaining brain homeostasis and CNS response during neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease conditions. These conditions often indicate a common neuroinflammatory need identified by the activated glial cells, releasing anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory cytokines, free radicals, chemokines, and neurotrophic factors. Evidence suggests that due to a large number of functions performed by the glial cells in the neuroinflammatory reactions, it is expected that the astrocytes and microglia have a significant effect on brain functioning during a viral infection, such as in COVID-19 patients. The extensive participation of glial cells in brain homeostasis management and viral infection expects that dysregulated glial cell function may explicitly and implicitly affect COVID-19 development. Aging is a crucial factor affecting the mortality rate in COVID-19 patients, even though the relation between SARS-CoV-2 and aging is still unclear. The age-based remodeling process is observed in astrocytes and microglia, which may ultimately cause damaged functional characteristics and contribute to the development of NDs (Figures 1 and 4) [142].",
            "Similarly, the glial cells are present in various functional/morphological abnormalities in the older brain, such as increased ROS, decreased phagocytic activity, and mortality, proinflammatory cytokine production, and enhanced DNA mitochondrial impairment. These changes may result in the loss of the normal glial cell neuroprotective behavior and induce neuroprotective and neurodegenerative disorder; therefore, it is not seen in older COVID-19 patients. It is well known that impaired proinflammatory cytokine release may cause enhanced systemic symptoms and neurological damage in COVID-19-infected patients; however, whether glial cell activation is beneficial or harmful to the brain of COVID-19 patients is still a matter of examination.",
            "The novel coronavirus infection has disrupted the world and its healthcare system unprecedentedly. This pandemic has also scared the viability and integrity of the present and near-future AD and PD research. However, local consequences will evolve and become distinct based on certain particular factors such as incidence, the linked death cases, the resource availability, and social changes that may control the COVID-19 pandemic. These local changes associated with AD and PD heterogeneity make simple generic suggestion inefficient. Therefore, the awareness about their probable consequences and alleviation approach adopted by the individual may prevent the harmful impact on patients with AD, PD, and their caretakers.",
            "Moreover, further research is needed to demonstrate the detailed HCoV infection mechanism that leads to neuronal impairment, particularly if HCoV can truly exploit the associated pathways of CNS invasion. In that case, it may be quite interesting to analyze where the specific mechanisms combine with the specific neurological disease symptoms; this is yet to be resolved.",

In addition to the development of acute Parkinsonism, COVID-19 may also elevate the PD risk in the long term due to sustained chronic inflammation and aggregation of α-synuclein.",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is associated with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression. Once it enters the brain, the SARS-CoV-2 virus stimulates accumulation of amyloids in the brain that are highly toxic to neural cells. These amyloids may trigger neurological symptoms in COVID-19. The meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) play an important role in removal of toxins and mediate viral drainage from the brain. MLVs are considered a promising target to prevent COVID-19-exacerbated dementia. However, there are limited methods for augmentation of MLV function. This review highlights new discoveries in the field of COVID-19-mediated amyloid accumulation in the brain associated with the neurological symptoms and the development of promising strategies to stimulate clearance of amyloids from the brain through lymphatic and other pathways. These strategies are based on innovative methods of treating brain dysfunction induced by COVID-19 infection, including the use of photobiomodulation, plasmalogens, and medicinal herbs, which offer hope for addressing the challenges posed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",
            "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a brain disorder that is accompanied by a gradual decline in memory, thinking and behavior skills. According to world statistics, the global number of people over 65 years old with AD doubles every 5 years [1]. As estimated, the incidence of AD will triple by 2060 unless the effective therapy is found to prevent or slow AD [1,2]. AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States [2]. During the period of 2020–2021, the number of deaths from stroke, cardiovascular disease, and human immunodeficiency virus decreased, whereas the number of people who died from AD increased more than 145% [2]. There is growing evidence that such a significant increase in mortality from AD may be associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. COVID-19 is primarily known as a severe acute respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but it also affects the central nervous system (CNS) and other organs [18,19,20,21,22,23]. Many neurological symptoms, including memory loss, cognitive impairment, fatigue, brain fog, and insomnia are reported in up to 30% of cases and may appear long after the infection (long COVID) [18]. However, despite considerable evidence that there is a relationship between COVID-19 and AD, it remains unclear if the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself causes AD and/or if the SARS-CoV-2 infection exacerbates existing AD. The virus hypothesis for AD has been proposed for decades, and despite supportive evidence, virus etiology of AD is still controversial [7,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. On the one hand, many clinical observations indicate an increased risk for COVID-19 in people with AD [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes long-lasting neurological sequelae [18,19,20,21,22,23]. The key question, whether COVID-19 can trigger new-onset AD or only accelerate AD progression, is unclear.",
            "It was recently discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 virus proteome includes different sequences of amyloid-forming proteins [4,29,30]. It is assumed that amyloid-forming proteins from the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be involved in the development of neurological symptoms in COVID-19-infected patients [3,4]. The SARS-CoV-2 amyloid could have cytotoxic and neuroinflammatory effects similar to those of amyloids that are responsible for amyloid-related neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Therefore, COVID-19-exacerbated AD could be a SARS-CoV-2 amyloid disorder. However, there is not enough evidence for this yet. Nevertheless, it has been noted that COVID-19 triggers systemic AA amyloidosis and upregulation of serum amyloid A protein [31]. On the other hand, amyloid beta (Aβ) has antiviral and antibacterial effects [32,33,34,35]. To this end, Aβ may be activated in the COVID-19-infected brain as a protective mechanism that can explain the proposed viral involvement in Aβ aggregation in the brain. However, despite the lack of a clear understanding of whether COVID-19 causes pathological amyloid accumulation in the brain or whether it aggravates already ongoing neurodegenerative processes, the indisputable fact is that the COVID-19 infection is accompanied by amyloid aggravation in the brain associated with the neurological disorders, including symptoms of AD and dementia.",
            "Medicines may improve or slow the progression of AD [36,37,38]. However, there is no promising treatment that cures AD and reduces the accumulation of amyloids in the brain. Clinical investigations have failed to show any effective pharmacological therapy for AD [39,40,41,42]. The latest clinical trials of aducanumab on 3285 patients with AD revealed significant consequences associated with immunotherapy, such as edema, microhemorrhage, nausea dizziness, headache, and confusion [42]. However, Aβ immunotherapy can be improved by modulation of functions of the meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) [43]. MLVs are now thought to be the major route for clearance of amyloids in AD [44,45,46,47,48,49]. Therefore, strategies for augmentation of lymphatic removal of amyloids from the brain can lay the foundation for the development of promising therapeutic approaches for AD [44]. MLV-based therapeutic strategies may be also useful for alleviating infection-induced neurological damage due to facilitation of virus clearance from the brain to the cervical lymph nodes [50].",
            "However, despite the emerging evidence suggesting that MLVs may serve as an efflux route for Aβ from the human and animal brain, confocal analysis of sinus-associated MLVs in patients who died from AD has not found Aβ deposits directly inside of MLVs [51]. This suggests the need to develop alternative strategies beyond MLV modulation to stimulate amyloid clearance from brain tissue. Approaches using natural compounds as inhibitors of Aβ aggregation in brain seem to be most promising [52,53].",
            "The focus of this review is to highlight new discoveries in the field of COVID-19-mediated amyloid accumulation in the brain associated with the neurological symptoms and the development of promising strategies to stimulate the clearance of amyloids from the brain through lymphatic and other pathways.",
            "Many proteins of viruses and bacteria have amyloid properties, which are thought to have an important role in the progression of infectious diseases [54,55,56,57]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has four main structural proteins, namely the spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins, as well as non-structural accessory proteins, including ORF6 and ORF10 [58,59] (Figure 1). The SARS-CoV-2 amyloids have been identified in the structural spike [60], the nucleocapsid [30], and the accessory ORF6/ORF10 proteins [4,61]. When the SARS-CoV-2 virus enters an infected cell, it creates many copies that are accompanied by an exponential increase in intracellular SARS-CoV-2 amyloids [62]. The spike proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus also bind to Aβ causing Aβ deposition in the brain [63,64,65] (Figure 1). The ORF10 protein causes mitochondrial dysfunction [66] mimicking AD-mediated metabolic disorders [4]. SARS-CoV-2 amyloids can be also released from infected cells into extracellular spaces, forming amyloid depositions leading to neurotoxicity and the pathophysiology of infection [4,30,60,62].",
            "If the SARS-CoV-2 virus contains amyloid-forming sequences in its genome, the question arises, what is their role? It is known that every component of the virus helps it to impede the host immune system and replicate. Therefore, there are several possible roles of SARS-CoV-2 amyloids. The simplest explanation is SARS-CoV-2 amyloids can be an inflammatory stimulus [67] leading to the high expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors on the surface of microglia, through which the virus enters the cell, and that increases intracellular transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus contains a lot of amyloidogenic sequences that may play an important role in RNA packing during virus replication [68,69,70]. It is also possible that SARS-CoV-2 amyloids might inhibit the host’s antiviral response, similar to other amyloids in other viruses [71].",
            "Recent studies have reported that COVID-19 is associated with structural changes in the brain [72,73,74,75,76]. Therefore, severe COVID-19 patients demonstrate a decrease in grey matter volume of the frontal lobe [77,78,79]. The grey matter in the CNS allows for the control of movement, memory, and emotions [80,81]. Memory deficits have been found in 19.2% of post-COVID patients [78]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can enter the hippocampus through invasion of the olfactory neurons [82,83]. Since the hippocampus plays a crucial role in regulation of episodic and spatial memory [84,85], hippocampal infection may lead to memory disorders in COVID-19 patients. Many forms of dementia are associated with deposition of different amyloids in the brain, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 amyloids might be involved in the development of COVID-19-mediated dementia and AD or contribute to their progression through an increase of amyloid toxicity and aggregation [4,29,30,63,86,87,88,89,90,91,92].",
            "There is also indirect mechanism of COVID-19-related AD dementia. COVID-19 as a respiratory diseases causes hypoxic changes to which the brain is highly sensitive [93,94,95,96]. It is noted that dementia and Aβ depositions are often accompanied by hypoxia of brain tissues [97,98,99,100,101,102,103]. This means that COVID-19-induced hypoxia might be an additional and independent factor promoting the development of dementia.",
            "In sum, it has been discovered that SARS-CoV-2 amyloids play a potential role in COVID-19-mediated AD dementia [3,4,29,30,60,62,63,64,65,66] (Figure 1). By causing respiratory infection and systemic inflammation, the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes the development of a cytokine storm leading to blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption [104,105,106,107,108,109]. We discussed the mechanism of COVID-19-related BBB damages in detail in our recent review [104]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can enter the different regions of the brain through the damaged BBB as well as penetrating into the hippocampus through invasion of the olfactory neurons [82,83,84,85,110,111]. In the brain, the SARS-CoV-2 virus stimulates production of amyloid deposits in both extracellular and intracellular spaces [3,4,29,30,60,62,63,64,65,66]. The toxicity of SARS-CoV-2 amyloids can directly induce brain changes and lead to the development or the progression of AD dementia [4,72,73,74,75,76,78,82,83,84,85,112,113]. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 amyloids can play a causative role in COVID-19-exacerbated dementia and may be the targets for therapeutic approaches in prevention of COVID-19-mediated memory disorders.",
            "Recent studies have demonstrated an important role of MLVs in the protection of the brain against pathogens and the development of neurodegenerative diseases [114,115,116,117]. Dysfunction of MLVs aggravates Aβ accumulation in the brain and significantly reduces the efficacy of immunotherapy against AD and brain tumors [43,44,118,119]. Several viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, herpes simplex virus 1, rabies virus, Zika virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus, can invade the brain and induce inflammation with meningitis and neurologic symptoms [120,121,122,123,124,125]. It is known that the brain is protected against viruses, bacteria, and toxins by the BBB. However, viruses can enter the brain through the olfactory and trigeminal nerves pathways, bypassing the BBB [82,83,123,126,127]. It is important to note that MLVs can transport viruses from the brain to the peripheral lymphatics [114]. Li et al. revealed that that viral infection in mice reduces brain drainage and lymphatic removal of macromolecules from the brain. Photo or surgical damages to MLVs increase neurological symptoms and mortality in virus-infected mice. However, vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) pretreatment promotes recovery of MLV functions against viral infection. These data indicate that MLVs facilitate lymphatic clearance of viruses, suggesting a promising MLV-based therapeutic approach against neurotropic viral infection [114]. Since MLVs play an important role in eliminating toxins and wastes from the brain, it is assumed that augmentation of MLV function could be a promising therapeutic target for preventing or delaying age-associated neurocognitive diseases, including COVID-19-mediated AD dementia [43,44,45,46,47,48,49,128,129].",
            "Thus, the development of effective methods for stimulation of MLV functions is highly relevant for medicine. Recently, non-invasive transcranial photobiomodulation (PBM) has been proposed as a novel alternative method for therapy for dementia and AD as well as a promising approach in the improvement of cognitive functions in healthy subjects [128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157]. It is believed that the therapeutic effects of PBM are based on reducing neuroinflammation and activation of anti-oxidant systems through the improvement of metabolism and microcirculation of the brain, leading to neuroprotection [133,138,139,141]. However, emerging evidence suggests that PBM can also stimulate MLV functions, providing lymphatic removal of wastes and metabolites, including Aβ, from the brain, leading to reduced AD progression [151,152,153,154,155,156,157]. Notably, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognized PBM as safe. The safe use of PBM is regulated by relevant standards, e.g., ANSI Z136 [158,159].",
            "The mechanisms of PBM-mediated improvement of cognitive function in healthy subjects and with AD are not clear, but it is most likely that it may be due to PBM stimulation of MLV function. Indeed, disruption of MLVs aggravates AD, leading to cognitive deficit and behavioral alterations [44,47,48,49,50,160,161]. Thus, MLV dysfunction might cause cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease due to aggregation of toxins in the brain, while PBM-stimulation of their lymphatic removal can improve the brain homeostasis, immunity and neuroprotection [43,44,46,47,48,49,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157].",
            "There is convincing evidence that PBM can modulate lymphatic contractility and pumping, improving drainage and removal of macromolecules from tissues (Figure 2a) [153,154,162]. The PBM-mediated increase in nitric oxide (NO) production could be one possible mechanism responsible for PBM-stimulation of the MLV functions. Indeed, PBM significantly increases NO generation in culture of isolated lymphatic endothelial cells [162]. The stimulating effects of PBM on MLVs are suppressed by the blockade of NO production [162]. How may NO promote contraction of lymphatic vessels? Traditionally, it is believed that NO suppresses lymphatic constriction. It is generally believed that NO causes relaxation of both blood and lymphatic vessels, suppressing their contractility. However, NO-related regulation of the lymphatic endothelium is much more complex than previously thought. It is known that the influx of fluid into the lymph vessel stimulates its contraction and NO production in the lymphatic endothelial cells increases in accordance with the intensity of vessel contractility [163]. Lymphatic constriction is accompanied by an elevated NO production in the lymphatic walls through an increased flow shear forces creating by coming fluids. In this case, NO causes dilation of the lymphatic endothelium after constriction, i.e., inhibits lymphatic pumping during high lymph flow. However, NO’s effects on different parts of the lymphatic vasculature are different. The lymphatic valves contain 50% more endothelial NO-synthase than tubular regions predominantly causing high NO production during the contraction of lymphatic vessels [163]. From a physiological perspective, during lymphatic constriction NO releases from the lymphatic valves into the lumen of the vessel and reaches tubular sites contributing their relaxation that is important for regulation of peristaltic pumping [163,164,165].",
            "The contraction phase of the lymphatic vessels depends on the opening of the Ca2+-channels, while the relaxation cycle is a component of local production of NO in the lymphatic endothelial cells that triggers by transiently elevated shear forces (Figure 2b). Ca2+ and NO cooperate in their regulation of lymph flow via mechanobiological mechanisms. During the contraction cycle, shear stress is increased and triggers activation of the endothelial NO synthase and NO production in the lymphatic valves. In this case, the elevated production of NO reduces intracellular Ca2+ concentration, leading to preparation of the lymphatic endothelial cells for subsequent relaxation. During the relaxation phase, due to the reduced fluid velocity in the now dilated vessel, NO production drops, which is accompanied by its rapid degradation. At this time, intracellular Ca2+ levels and membrane potentials are restored in preparation for another contraction of the vessels, which can be triggered by any signal able to initiate the opening of Ca2+ channels or Ca2+ flux from calmodulin (calcium-binding messenger protein) or through the gap junctions of neighboring cells (Figure 2b).",
            "We hypothesize that PBM can stimulate brain drainage and lymphatic clearance of macromolecules, including amyloids and viruses, from the brain due to PBM-mediated regulation of combination of mechanical and electrophysiological events associated with the pumping of the lymphatic vessels via PBM-mediated stimulation of NO production in the lymphatic endothelial cells (Figure 2c).",
            "Lipids play a crucial role in the structure and functioning of the brain. The brain contains the second highest amount of lipids after adipose tissue. However, the type of lipids found in the brain is different from that in adipose tissue, with phospholipids being the main component in the brain. The brain contains a significant amount of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid, arachidonic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid, which are mainly stored in phospholipids. These phospholipids are essential components of cell membranes and play a critical role in their proper functioning [166,167,168,169]. Cholesterol and phospholipids containing saturated fatty acids are concentrated in lipid rafts present in cell membranes. These rafts are involved in cell signaling. Membrane fluidity, supported by phospholipids consisting of unsaturated fatty acids, is crucial for membrane-associated functions. It includes the processing of amyloid precursor protein and plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of AD. The composition of phospholipids in cell membranes is involved in important neural functions, such as vesicular fusion and neurotransmitter release, which can be altered in AD [170,171,172,173].",
            "Among phospholipids, plasmalogens play an enormous role in maintaining brain homeostasis. They appear to be the missing link between the biochemical and functional abnormalities observed in AD and its pathological signs, such as the accumulation of Aβ in the brain [174,175,176,177].",
            "Plasmalogens are glycerophospholipids that are vital for brain function [178,179]. They are the primary structural components of lipoproteins, myelin, synaptic membranes, and cell membranes. Plasmalogens possess unique physicochemical characteristics that help regulate membrane fluidity, lipid packaging into lipoproteins, and interaction with nerve receptors and ion channels. These lipids are also necessary for synaptogenesis, myelination, and ion transport [180].",
            "Plasmalogens are synthesized in the peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum. The initial reaction involves the acylation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate by acyltransferase. Cells tightly regulate plasmalogen levels. Excessive levels of plasmalogens act as feedback inhibitors, reducing the levels of fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1. This reduction occurs by promoting the degradation of protein, which provides fatty alcohols in the synthesis [179,181]. Peroxisome biogenesis disorders affect the metabolism of lipids and reactive oxygen species, leading to symptoms such as hypomyelination due to low plasmalogen levels and increased inflammation. Cells with a deficiency in plasmalogen synthesis have low oxidation resistance, but adding alkylglycerol as a plasmalogen precursor can increase plasmalogen levels and enhance oxidative resistance [176].",
            "The emergence of age-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson’s disease, and AD are associated with oxidative stress and chronic neuroinflammation. The disruption of redox homeostasis leads to peroxisome malfunction and impaired plasmalogen production, which could be a mechanism of the development of age-related diseases [174,182,183].",
            "The level of plasmalogens in the brain increases until 30–40 years and then decreases sharply at about 70 years [184,185,186]. This age range coincides with the period of life when the incidence of AD increases exponentially [187,188,189]. Given the sharp decrease in brain plasmalogen levels with age and their critical role in maintaining brain homeostasis, it is not surprising that deficiency of plasmalogens in the brain is closely associated with the progression of aging-related neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and Parkinson’s disease [174,175,190].",
            "Oxidative cleavage of the vinyl ether bond by cytochrome C in the presence of H2O2 [191,192] is a potential mechanism of degradation of plasmalogens. A decrease in peroxisomal function combined with higher H2O2 levels potentially causes a permanent plasmalogen deficiency, which leads to membrane changes, signaling abnormalities, reduced neurotransmission, and suppressed antioxidant protection [193]. Oxidative stress associated with inflammation potentially exacerbates the degradation of plasmalogens by attacking the vinyl–ether bond, further reducing anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity of tissues and initiating an irreversible vicious circle that progresses to pathological abnormalities [175].",
            "During COVID-19 infection, the spike viral protein interacts with ACE2, which leads to the excessive production of angiotensin II and the activation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. This subsequently leads to an increase in oxidative stress and release of inflammatory molecules [194]. Unlike other viral infections, COVID-19 infection severity is usually associated with age and may be linked to an imbalance in the redox system. This can cause an accumulation of oxidative damage and a decline in the antioxidant defense system, resulting in an increase in reactive oxygen species [195].",
            "Thus, plasmalogens, which reflect peroxisomes’ functional activity, can be used as biomarkers for diseases related to oxidative stress and aging, as well as a critical therapeutic target [182,196]. A study conducted by Yamashita et al. revealed that administration of Ascidian Viscera glycerophospholipid (EtnGpl), a plasmalogen-rich ethanolamine, to rats with an injected model of AD improves their learning ability and working memory through reducing oxidative stress in the brain [197]. Chronic injection of lipopolysaccharides in mice can lead to the activation of glial cells and accumulation of Aβ proteins in the brain that are associated with cognitive deficit. Hossain et al. clearly show that plasmalogens prevent neuronal cell death by activating protein kinase B and inhibiting caspase 3, improving neuronal survival [198,199]. Wood et al. found that the serum level of plasmalogens is significantly reduced in patients with AD and correlates with severity of dementia [200]. These data indicate that the circulating level of plasmalogens may be an indicator of the progression of AD.",
            "There is growing evidence suggesting improvement of cognitive deficits in both animals and humans with neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, scallop- and ascidian-derived plasmalogens can reduce the incidence of cognitive impairment in subjects with mild forgetfulness, AD and Parkinson’s disease due to an increase in the plasma ethanolamine plasmalogen (PlsEtn) levels [201,202,203,204]. Chicken-derived plasmalogens have similar effects in healthy people with mild memory problems [205]. Phosphatidylserine plasmalogen species attenuate cognitive disorders after cerebrovascular injury [206].",
            "The advantages of marine plasmalogens from ascidians, scallops, and sea cucumbers and the mechanisms underlying their beneficial effects on memory function are not well understood due to differences approaches in experiments, including dose, duration, and ethnicity of volunteers.",
            "In aged mice, marine plasmalogens ameliorate memory deficit via activation of neurogenesis [53]. Amyloid-mediated neuroinflammation is associated with a decrease in the brain PlsEtn levels leading to suppression of the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and reduced neurogenesis [207,208]. These changes promote the high expression of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) leading to neural death and neurite degeneration [207,209]. However, the administration of PlsEtn reduces Aβ depositions in the brain and tau hyperphosphorylation by attenuation of the p75NTR and PKCδ expression, which leads to reducing neuroinflammation [207,209,210].",
            "Chicken plasmalogens also enhance memory by attenuation of neuroinflammation [208,211]. However, marine PlsEtn enhances memory function better than chicken-derived plasmalogens, probably because marine PlsEtn is richer in DHA than the chicken derivative [208,210].",
            "It is noted that brain levels of PlsEtn containing DHA in the cortex correlate with cognitive abilities of rats with AD [197,212,213]. In vitro experiments have shown that PlsEtn bearing DHA exhibits strong suppression of neuronal inflammation, apoptosis, γ-secretase activity, and Aβ aggregation [212,213,214]. Interestingly, intravenously injected small-sized liposomes can increase the bioavailability of PlsEtn with DHA, enhancing their beneficial effects on locomotor activity in normal rats [215,216].",
            "Systemic administration of plasmalogens over 7 days reduces microglia inflammation induced by Aβ accumulation [217]. Longer treatment with scallop-derived plasmalogens over 15 months decreases both the expression of markers of inflammation and the protein kinase C-δ (PKCδ) involved in apoptosis [209]. Rothhaar et al. reported that murine plasmalogens reduce gamma-secretase activity in cell membranes isolated from post-mortem brain AD tissue [218].",
            "However, murine plasmalogens can be beneficial for AD and improvement of cognitive function due to an increase in the brain PlsEtn level and neurogenesis, leading to reducing amyloid accumulation, tau hyperpolarization attenuating neuroinflammation and neuron death (Figure 3).",
            "Current pharmacological therapy for AD includes use of cholinesterase inhibitors, anti-Aβ vaccine, and anti-neuroinflammation drugs [219,220,221]. Rivastigmine, galantamine, memantine, and donepezil are approved for treatment of AD [219,220,221]. However, these medications only partly improve quality of people with AD [222,223]. Monoclonal antibody anti-Aβ therapy, including aducanumab, lecanemab, and GV971, is a new strategy in therapy for AD in recent years. However, the safety and effectiveness of these drugs are still controversial, and these drugs are very expensive [224,225,226,227]. There are 43 new clinical drug trials registered in the National Library of Medicine database (ClinicalTrials.gov: accessed on 28 April 2024). However, the most common outcome was a lack of efficacy or only control of early symptoms of AD.",
            "Thus, no effective cure for AD currently exists, and available pharmacological strategies have shown limited effectiveness. Therefore, the search for new approaches to AD therapy is crucial to address the growing burden of this pathology. Medicinal herbs are a promising avenue for the treatment of AD [228,229,230,231,232,233]. Natural compounds were the first therapy used for AD [233]. Although the mechanisms of therapeutic effects of ayurvedic medicinal herbs remain largely unknown, extensive experimental and clinical studies on phytochemical actions have found a wide range of beneficial effects for AD within these plants [228,229,230,231,232,233]. There are several natural components exhibiting therapeutic effectiveness for AD, including flavonoids, polyphenols, sterols, alkaloids, triterpenes, lignans, and tannins with effects against to oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, amyloid deposition, and activity of cholinesterase.",
            "Here, we highlight the applications of various natural compounds as a novel treatment for AD (Figure 4).",
            "Turmeric is the root of Curcuma longa, and its main active ingredients are curcuminoids. The most important and most abundant of these curcuminoids is curcumin [234,235]. Curcumin has been approved by the FDA as a natural dietary supplement due to its safety and non-toxicity. Scientists’ interest in curcumin increased due to its unique molecular structure, which has multiple effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective actions [236]. It also has the ability to disaggregate tau proteins [237] and target amyloid plaques, which are one of the main causes of AD [238]. Studies have shown that among people aged 70–79, there is a 4.4-fold lower incidence of AD in India compared to the USA. This may be due to the fact that people in India consume more curry, which contains curcumin, and perform better on cognitive function tests [239].",
            "Piperine is an alkaloid found in black pepper (Piper nigrum) and long pepper (Piper longum) [239]. It has been found that piperine can increase the absorption of various drugs [240], and it has also been observed that when curcumin is taken with piperine, the absorption of curcumin increases by 154% in rats and 2000% in humans [241,242]. It has been shown to improve the solubility, stability, and absorption of curcumin. However, curcumin has a poor oral bioavailability. To improve oral curcumin delivery to the brain, self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (S-SNEDDS) have been developed using a nanotechnological approach [243]. In this study, the authors clearly demonstrate a significant dose-dependent therapeutic effect of combined curcumin with S-SNEDDS than drug alone in an AD model.",
            "Ginkgo biloba is commonly used in the treatment of AD cognitive impairment due to its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties [244,245]. Its leaves contain various essential components, such as flavonoids, steroids, organic acids, ginkgolides, and terpenoids. These compounds, including bilobalide and ginkgolide, are crucial for its therapeutic effects [246,247]. Flavone glycosides make up approximately 22–27% of the extract, while terpene lactones comprise about 5–7% [246]. Specific terpene lactone compounds include A, B, and C ginkgolides and bilobalide.",
            "Ginkgo biloba contains varies flavone glycosides, such as quercetin, isorhamnetin and kaempferol, that play a crucial role in preventing oxidative stress in AD [246]. The herb is thought to work through several mechanisms, including preventing apoptosis, reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting the formation of amyloid plaques, and scavenging free radicals. These actions help to prevent and treat AD. The plant extract also inhibits the neurotoxic effects of Aβ by regulating the activity of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. This helps to limit neuronal apoptosis, reduce the build-up of reactive oxygen species, and improve glucose uptake and mitochondrial function. It also prevents the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathways. There is convincing evidence that Ginkgo biloba can enhance cognitive function in patients with AD by improving oxygen supply to brain tissues and reducing the brain level of free radicals [246,247].",
            "Bacopa monnieri is a well-respected nootropic herb that has been used for centuries to treat neurological conditions. A chemical analysis of extract from Bacopa monnieri has revealed the presence of various bioactive compounds, including triterpenoids, alkaloids (such as nicotine, brahmine, and herpestine), saponins, glycosides, D-mannitol, herpaponin, monnierin, and alcohols. This plant also contains a variety of phytocompounds, such as bacosides A and B, bacosaponins A, B, C, bacosapeptides III to V, bacosapans D, E, F, jujubogenin, betulic acid, alkaloids, polyphenols, steroids, and sulfur compounds, all of which indicate its antioxidant properties. The antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of Bacopa monnieri make it a promising herb for AD. The main substances responsible for its neuroprotective effects are bacosides A and B due to their beneficial effects on the transmission of nerve signals and recovery of injured neurons [248]. The antioxidant activity of Bacopa monnieri also leads to an increase in various antioxidant molecules, including superoxide dismutase, thus reducing the harmful effects of H2O2-induced oxidative stress. In addition, this herb decreases lipoxygenase activity, assisting in the recovery from oxidative stress [249]. The diversity of bioactive compounds in Bacopa monnieri emphasizes its potential as a natural remedy for enhancing brain health and cognitive function.",
            "Salvia officinalis is a fragrant herb that is widely used in the treatment of AD [250,251]. Salvia contains more than 160 different polyphenolic compounds, including phenolic acids, and flavonoids. These include yunnaninic acid, lithospermum acids, salvianic acid, and others. It also contains flavonoids such as kaempferol, apigenin, and luteolin. In addition to these compounds, salvia is rich in terpenes such as alpha- and beta-thujones, 1,8-cineole, alpha-humulene, and camphor. These compounds can be found in the essential oils of the plant. Plants also contain significant quantities of diterpenes and triterpene acids, including tanshinones, carnosic acid, carnosol, and ursolic acid [249,250,251]. Salvia has great potential for promoting brain homeostasis and improving cognitive function. Indeed, Salvia officinalis has been shown to have anti-Aβ, anti-inflammatory and anxiolytic properties [249,250,251]. Salvia officinalis also demonstrates stimulating effects on the muscarinic and cholinergic pathways of the regulation of memory retention and formation, suggesting its supporting influences on cognitive properties.",

The extracts from Melissa officinalis are rich in beneficial substances, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and triterpenes. Thanks to these substances, the plant exhibits pronounced sedative, anti-depressant, and anti-inflammatory effects [254].",
            "Studies have shown that lemon balm has the ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase and exhibit antioxidant activity, making it valuable in preventing and treating AD [252,253,254,255,256,257]. In addition, lemon balm has anticholinesterase activity, binds to cholinergic receptors, and exhibits neuroprotective properties [256]. Some substances in lemon balm interact with muscarinic acetylcholine and nicotine receptors, leading to a decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity [256]. By modulating the cholinergic system, lemon balm is a promising treatment for AD, as it has been observed to reduce arousal and improve cognitive function in people with mild to moderate AD [252,253,254,255,256,257,258].",

            "MLVs play an important role in removal of wastes, metabolites, and toxins from the brain [44,45,46,47,48,49]. Therefore, MLVs are considered a promising target in therapy for brain diseases, including AD [43,44,45,46,47,48,49,128,129]. However, there are very limited pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods for augmentation of the MLV functions.",
            "Recently, it has been proposed to introduce VEGF-C into the cisterna magna as a new method of pharmacological stimulation of MLV function [43,44,118,119]. However, this method has several limitations: (i) it is an invasive and traumatic method; (ii) VEFG-C has different side effects; and (iii) there are only few positive results in clinical studies in this area [261].",
            "Herbal medicine has been proposed as alternative method in reducing lymphedema burden and drainage of different tissues [262,263]. Indeed, coumarin, juniper, black pepper, geranium, sage, and fennel are known to reduce swelling, and French oak wood extract containing robuvit leads to a sharp reduction in swelling [262]. Particular effectiveness of plant flavonoids has been shown in filarial lymphedema (edema of infectious origin) and in patients with breast cancer (edema of tumor origin) [264].",
            "It is assumed that plant substances can enhance the drainage function of the lymphatic system via activation of the mechanisms lymphoneogenesis, including the high expression of VEFG proteins. Thus, Panax pseudoginseng increases mRNA levels of VEGF-C and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3), leading to the stimulation and formation of new lymphatic vessels [265]. The stimulating effects on lymphangiogenesis have been found also for licoricidin, astragalus, and cinobufacini [263].",
            "Plant substances can also be used to improve the drainage function of MLVs. Borneol (C10H18O, molecular weight 154.25) can quickly penetrate the BBB and enter the brain after oral administration within 5 min and reaches maximum concentration in the brain within 1 h [266,267], with the most efficient accumulation in the cerebral cortex and slightly less in the hippocampus and the hypothalamus [268,269]. Some studies demonstrate the effectiveness of borneol in therapy for AD, stroke, and epilepsy [270,271,272,273,274]. Indeed, Borneol improves removal of amyloids from the brain due to activation of lymphangiogenesis leading to improvement of cholinergic regulation of memory function.",
            "The recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 amyloids can play a crucial role in COVID-19-exacerbated dementia. Once the virus has penetrated the brain, it stimulates production of amyloid deposits at both extracellular and intracellular spaces. The toxicity of the SARS-CoV-2 amyloids can directly damage the brain, leading to the development or the progression of AD dementia. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 amyloids may be targets for therapeutic approaches in prevention of COVID-19-mediated memory disorders and cognitive deficits. In this aspect, MLVs play a special role in the elimination of both amyloids and the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the brain [44,45,46,47,48,49,114]. It is actively being discussed whether increasing MLV functions will open a new page in the history of therapy for brain diseases associated with amyloidosis and lymphatic dysfunction, including AD, Parkinson’s disease, intracranial hemorrhages, brain trauma, and oncology [44,45,46,47,48,49,118,119,162,275,276]. However, this direction is in its infancy, which explains the limitation of technologies and pharmacological strategies for augmentation of MLVs to prevent or slow amyloidosis and MLV dysfunction. Among MLV stimulation technologies, the most promising is PBM because it is safe, without side effects, and approved by the FDA. There is emerging evidence suggesting that PBM effectively stimulates lymphatic removal of macromolecules, including Aβ and red blood cells from the brain as well as enhances brain’s drainage [153,154,155,156,157,162], leading to a significant improvement of memory function and cognitive properties in both healthy and AD subjects [128,157]. A pioneering direction is the development of portable technologies for PBM under the control of deep sleep. The animal and human data suggest that deep sleep is accompanied by strong activation of brain’s drainage and elimination of wastes and metabolites from the brain with the flow of brain fluids to the peripheral lymphatics [277,278]. It is obvious to assume that PBM of the MLV function and brain’s drainage will be most effective at the moment of their natural activation, i.e., during deep sleep [128,129]. Indeed, pilot results clearly show that PBM during deep sleep more effectively stimulates lymphatic removal of Aβ in an AD model and activates the brain’s drainage in both healthy mice and MLV-defective animals than PBM during wakefulness [45,128,129,151,157]. The use of PBM during sleep is also a promising direction in the treatment of brain tumors [279].",
            "Among the pharmacological strategies for increasing the MLV functions, the direction of increasing lymphangiogenesis by introducing VEGF-C into the cisterna magna is widely discussed [43,118,119]. However, this method has limitations due to its invasiveness, side effects, and unproven clinical effectiveness. Therefore, the development of new alternative strategies to stimulate the MLV functions and remove macromolecules from the brain is a priority in medicine. Plasmalogens are a unique class of phospholipids playing an important role in membrane structure and in neural functions. Interestingly, the level of plasmalogens in the brain is dramatically reduced in AD subjects and is one of key mechanisms responsible for AD. The growing evidence demonstrates that plasmalogens can help to prevent some of AD progression through suppression of amyloid and tau accumulation, reducing neuroinflammation and activation of neurogenesis leading to significant improvement of cognitive and memory properties [53,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218]. Plasmalogens also effectively increase resistance to chronic stress via activation of the immune system [280,281].",
            "Large families of medical herbs have emerged as promising avenues in the treatment of AD [234,235,236,237,238,239,240,241,242,243,244,245,246,247,248,249,250,251,252,253,254,255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274]. Although the mechanisms of their therapeutic action remain largely unknown, extensive studies have identified various beneficial compounds in their extracts, including flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, triterpenes with anti-inflammatory, anti-amyloidogenic, anticholinesterase, and antioxidant effects. These therapeutic effects suggest their potential as promising alternative treatments for AD and offer hope for addressing the difficulties posed by this incurable disease.",
            "Given the new challenges associated with the rapidly growing problems of brain damage by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, immediate solutions aimed at increasing the resistance of the brain and its immune system to the COVID-19-mediated brain injuries are required. Since it takes 10 to 15 years for new pharmacological drugs to appear on the market, non-pharmacological methods of treating brain dysfunction induced by COVID-19 infection, including the use of PBM, plasmalogens, and medicinal herbs, should be more actively studied to develop effective alternative strategies to help COVID-19 patients.",
            "Aβ is a normal product of neuronal metabolism eliminating from brain tissues through MLVs [44,45,128,129,151,157,277]. The conditions that can impair the function of lymphatic drainage processes, such as COVID-19 infection, or chronic sleep deprivation (less than 6 h), promote excessive accumulation of Aβ in brain tissues [3,4,29,30,128,129,282,283]. Recent findings have shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus-related accumulation of Aβ, which is identical to amyloids in AD, leads to the development of COVID-19-induced dementia [3,4,29,30]. Since virus-induced dementia develops quickly (in just a few weeks), it is logical to assume that this process may be reversible, as is the case with mild cognitive impairment [284,285,286,287,288,289]. Sleep deficiency over 20 years can lead to the development of dementia in 30% of cases, probably due to long-term Aβ deposition in brain tissues [283]. However, 70% of people experiencing chronic sleep deficiency do not develop dementia, indicating that they are either resistant to this process or it is reversible in them [283]. Thus, dementia and accumulation of Aβ in the brain associated with COVID-19 infection and sleep deficiency can be reversible and therefore treatable.",
            "There is evidence that the dissolved form of Aβ, located in the perivascular spaces, is most toxic to neurons and synapses [290]. Soluble Aβ is rapidly cleared from the human brain within 1–2.5 h [291]. However, this clearance is impaired in AD and other forms of dementia, leading to Aβ aggregation in the brain. Because MLVs play an important role in draining brain tissues and removing toxins and metabolites from the brain, future treatments for reversible forms of dementia are expected to involve stimulation of lymphatic drainage processes. Given the growing evidence of the existence of lymphatic vessels directly in the human brain [292,293,294,295], and not only in its meninges [296,297], technologies for activating lymphatic drainage processes will contribute to progress in the treatment of a wide number of brain diseases associated with dysfunction of the cerebral lymphatic system, such as AD, Parkinson’s disease, brain trauma and oncology [44,45,46,47,48,49,118,119,162,275,276].",
            "Recent animal studies have proposed PBM as an effective technology for stimulating the lymphatic clearance of Aβ and blood products [45,46,151,162,298,299]. However, PBM has limitations due to light scattering as it passes through the skull and the low doses used for photo-therapy [300]. Therefore, the use of PBM alone may not be sufficient to effective treat dementia, even if it is reversible. The alternative methods that could enhance the stimulatory effects of PBM may improve its therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we analyze the potential effectiveness of natural compounds, such as plasmalogens and medical herbs, to enhance lymphatic drainage processes in the brain. It is assumed that the combination of PBM and natural ingredients can become a reliable alternative in the treatment of various forms of reversible dementia.",
            "Unlike moderate dementia, dementia associated with AD is irreversible, and there are no prospects for the emergence of new methods for completely curing this disease. However, PBM has been shown to be effective in pilot clinical trials in controlling progression of AD [128,134,135,136,137,140,141,146,147,148,149,150]. It is expected that while the search for a reliable and safe pharmacological treatment for AD is underway, the combination of PBM with natural products will help prevent the rapid progression of the disease, as well as increase the brain’s resistance to the toxic effects of Aβ.",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is associated with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression. Once it enters the brain, the SARS-CoV-2 virus stimulates accumulation of amyloids in the brain that are highly toxic to neural cells. These amyloids may trigger neurological symptoms in COVID-19. The meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) play an important role in removal of toxins and mediate viral drainage from the brain. MLVs are considered a promising target to prevent COVID-19-exacerbated dementia. However, there are limited methods for augmentation of MLV function. This review highlights new discoveries in the field of COVID-19-mediated amyloid accumulation in the brain associated with the neurological symptoms and the development of promising strategies to stimulate clearance of amyloids from the brain through lymphatic and other pathways. These strategies are based on innovative methods of treating brain dysfunction induced by COVID-19 infection, including the use of photobiomodulation, plasmalogens, and medicinal herbs, which offer hope for addressing the challenges posed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",
            "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a brain disorder that is accompanied by a gradual decline in memory, thinking and behavior skills. According to world statistics, the global number of people over 65 years old with AD doubles every 5 years [1]. As estimated, the incidence of AD will triple by 2060 unless the effective therapy is found to prevent or slow AD [1,2]. AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States [2]. During the period of 2020–2021, the number of deaths from stroke, cardiovascular disease, and human immunodeficiency virus decreased, whereas the number of people who died from AD increased more than 145% [2]. There is growing evidence that such a significant increase in mortality from AD may be associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. COVID-19 is primarily known as a severe acute respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but it also affects the central nervous system (CNS) and other organs [18,19,20,21,22,23]. Many neurological symptoms, including memory loss, cognitive impairment, fatigue, brain fog, and insomnia are reported in up to 30% of cases and may appear long after the infection (long COVID) [18]. However, despite considerable evidence that there is a relationship between COVID-19 and AD, it remains unclear if the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself causes AD and/or if the SARS-CoV-2 infection exacerbates existing AD. The virus hypothesis for AD has been proposed for decades, and despite supportive evidence, virus etiology of AD is still controversial [7,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. On the one hand, many clinical observations indicate an increased risk for COVID-19 in people with AD [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes long-lasting neurological sequelae [18,19,20,21,22,23]. The key question, whether COVID-19 can trigger new-onset AD or only accelerate AD progression, is unclear.",
            "It was recently discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 virus proteome includes different sequences of amyloid-forming proteins [4,29,30]. It is assumed that amyloid-forming proteins from the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be involved in the development of neurological symptoms in COVID-19-infected patients [3,4]. The SARS-CoV-2 amyloid could have cytotoxic and neuroinflammatory effects similar to those of amyloids that are responsible for amyloid-related neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. Therefore, COVID-19-exacerbated AD could be a SARS-CoV-2 amyloid disorder. However, there is not enough evidence for this yet. Nevertheless, it has been noted that COVID-19 triggers systemic AA amyloidosis and upregulation of serum amyloid A protein [31]. On the other hand, amyloid beta (Aβ) has antiviral and antibacterial effects [32,33,34,35]. To this end, Aβ may be activated in the COVID-19-infected brain as a protective mechanism that can explain the proposed viral involvement in Aβ aggregation in the brain. However, despite the lack of a clear understanding of whether COVID-19 causes pathological amyloid accumulation in the brain or whether it aggravates already ongoing neurodegenerative processes, the indisputable fact is that the COVID-19 infection is accompanied by amyloid aggravation in the brain associated with the neurological disorders, including symptoms of AD and dementia.",
            "Medicines may improve or slow the progression of AD [36,37,38]. However, there is no promising treatment that cures AD and reduces the accumulation of amyloids in the brain. Clinical investigations have failed to show any effective pharmacological therapy for AD [39,40,41,42]. The latest clinical trials of aducanumab on 3285 patients with AD revealed significant consequences associated with immunotherapy, such as edema, microhemorrhage, nausea dizziness, headache, and confusion [42]. However, Aβ immunotherapy can be improved by modulation of functions of the meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) [43]. MLVs are now thought to be the major route for clearance of amyloids in AD [44,45,46,47,48,49]. Therefore, strategies for augmentation of lymphatic removal of amyloids from the brain can lay the foundation for the development of promising therapeutic approaches for AD [44]. MLV-based therapeutic strategies may be also useful for alleviating infection-induced neurological damage due to facilitation of virus clearance from the brain to the cervical lymph nodes [50].",
            "However, despite the emerging evidence suggesting that MLVs may serve as an efflux route for Aβ from the human and animal brain, confocal analysis of sinus-associated MLVs in patients who died from AD has not found Aβ deposits directly inside of MLVs [51]. This suggests the need to develop alternative strategies beyond MLV modulation to stimulate amyloid clearance from brain tissue. Approaches using natural compounds as inhibitors of Aβ aggregation in brain seem to be most promising [52,53].",
            "The focus of this review is to highlight new discoveries in the field of COVID-19-mediated amyloid accumulation in the brain associated with the neurological symptoms and the development of promising strategies to stimulate the clearance of amyloids from the brain through lymphatic and other pathways.",
            "Many proteins of viruses and bacteria have amyloid properties, which are thought to have an important role in the progression of infectious diseases [54,55,56,57]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has four main structural proteins, namely the spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins, as well as non-structural accessory proteins, including ORF6 and ORF10 [58,59] (Figure 1). The SARS-CoV-2 amyloids have been identified in the structural spike [60], the nucleocapsid [30], and the accessory ORF6/ORF10 proteins [4,61]. When the SARS-CoV-2 virus enters an infected cell, it creates many copies that are accompanied by an exponential increase in intracellular SARS-CoV-2 amyloids [62]. The spike proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus also bind to Aβ causing Aβ deposition in the brain [63,64,65] (Figure 1). The ORF10 protein causes mitochondrial dysfunction [66] mimicking AD-mediated metabolic disorders [4]. SARS-CoV-2 amyloids can be also released from infected cells into extracellular spaces, forming amyloid depositions leading to neurotoxicity and the pathophysiology of infection [4,30,60,62].",
            "If the SARS-CoV-2 virus contains amyloid-forming sequences in its genome, the question arises, what is their role? It is known that every component of the virus helps it to impede the host immune system and replicate. Therefore, there are several possible roles of SARS-CoV-2 amyloids. The simplest explanation is SARS-CoV-2 amyloids can be an inflammatory stimulus [67] leading to the high expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors on the surface of microglia, through which the virus enters the cell, and that increases intracellular transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus contains a lot of amyloidogenic sequences that may play an important role in RNA packing during virus replication [68,69,70]. It is also possible that SARS-CoV-2 amyloids might inhibit the host’s antiviral response, similar to other amyloids in other viruses [71].",
            "Recent studies have reported that COVID-19 is associated with structural changes in the brain [72,73,74,75,76]. Therefore, severe COVID-19 patients demonstrate a decrease in grey matter volume of the frontal lobe [77,78,79]. The grey matter in the CNS allows for the control of movement, memory, and emotions [80,81]. Memory deficits have been found in 19.2% of post-COVID patients [78]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can enter the hippocampus through invasion of the olfactory neurons [82,83]. Since the hippocampus plays a crucial role in regulation of episodic and spatial memory [84,85], hippocampal infection may lead to memory disorders in COVID-19 patients. Many forms of dementia are associated with deposition of different amyloids in the brain, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 amyloids might be involved in the development of COVID-19-mediated dementia and AD or contribute to their progression through an increase of amyloid toxicity and aggregation [4,29,30,63,86,87,88,89,90,91,92].",
            "There is also indirect mechanism of COVID-19-related AD dementia. COVID-19 as a respiratory diseases causes hypoxic changes to which the brain is highly sensitive [93,94,95,96]. It is noted that dementia and Aβ depositions are often accompanied by hypoxia of brain tissues [97,98,99,100,101,102,103]. This means that COVID-19-induced hypoxia might be an additional and independent factor promoting the development of dementia.",
            "In sum, it has been discovered that SARS-CoV-2 amyloids play a potential role in COVID-19-mediated AD dementia [3,4,29,30,60,62,63,64,65,66] (Figure 1). By causing respiratory infection and systemic inflammation, the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes the development of a cytokine storm leading to blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption [104,105,106,107,108,109]. We discussed the mechanism of COVID-19-related BBB damages in detail in our recent review [104]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can enter the different regions of the brain through the damaged BBB as well as penetrating into the hippocampus through invasion of the olfactory neurons [82,83,84,85,110,111]. In the brain, the SARS-CoV-2 virus stimulates production of amyloid deposits in both extracellular and intracellular spaces [3,4,29,30,60,62,63,64,65,66]. The toxicity of SARS-CoV-2 amyloids can directly induce brain changes and lead to the development or the progression of AD dementia [4,72,73,74,75,76,78,82,83,84,85,112,113]. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 amyloids can play a causative role in COVID-19-exacerbated dementia and may be the targets for therapeutic approaches in prevention of COVID-19-mediated memory disorders.",
            "Recent studies have demonstrated an important role of MLVs in the protection of the brain against pathogens and the development of neurodegenerative diseases [114,115,116,117]. Dysfunction of MLVs aggravates Aβ accumulation in the brain and significantly reduces the efficacy of immunotherapy against AD and brain tumors [43,44,118,119]. Several viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, herpes simplex virus 1, rabies virus, Zika virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus, can invade the brain and induce inflammation with meningitis and neurologic symptoms [120,121,122,123,124,125]. It is known that the brain is protected against viruses, bacteria, and toxins by the BBB. However, viruses can enter the brain through the olfactory and trigeminal nerves pathways, bypassing the BBB [82,83,123,126,127]. It is important to note that MLVs can transport viruses from the brain to the peripheral lymphatics [114]. Li et al. revealed that that viral infection in mice reduces brain drainage and lymphatic removal of macromolecules from the brain. Photo or surgical damages to MLVs increase neurological symptoms and mortality in virus-infected mice. However, vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) pretreatment promotes recovery of MLV functions against viral infection. These data indicate that MLVs facilitate lymphatic clearance of viruses, suggesting a promising MLV-based therapeutic approach against neurotropic viral infection [114]. Since MLVs play an important role in eliminating toxins and wastes from the brain, it is assumed that augmentation of MLV function could be a promising therapeutic target for preventing or delaying age-associated neurocognitive diseases, including COVID-19-mediated AD dementia [43,44,45,46,47,48,49,128,129].",
            "Thus, the development of effective methods for stimulation of MLV functions is highly relevant for medicine. Recently, non-invasive transcranial photobiomodulation (PBM) has been proposed as a novel alternative method for therapy for dementia and AD as well as a promising approach in the improvement of cognitive functions in healthy subjects [128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157]. It is believed that the therapeutic effects of PBM are based on reducing neuroinflammation and activation of anti-oxidant systems through the improvement of metabolism and microcirculation of the brain, leading to neuroprotection [133,138,139,141]. However, emerging evidence suggests that PBM can also stimulate MLV functions, providing lymphatic removal of wastes and metabolites, including Aβ, from the brain, leading to reduced AD progression [151,152,153,154,155,156,157]. Notably, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognized PBM as safe. The safe use of PBM is regulated by relevant standards, e.g., ANSI Z136 [158,159].",
            "The mechanisms of PBM-mediated improvement of cognitive function in healthy subjects and with AD are not clear, but it is most likely that it may be due to PBM stimulation of MLV function. Indeed, disruption of MLVs aggravates AD, leading to cognitive deficit and behavioral alterations [44,47,48,49,50,160,161]. Thus, MLV dysfunction might cause cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease due to aggregation of toxins in the brain, while PBM-stimulation of their lymphatic removal can improve the brain homeostasis, immunity and neuroprotection [43,44,46,47,48,49,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157].",
            "There is convincing evidence that PBM can modulate lymphatic contractility and pumping, improving drainage and removal of macromolecules from tissues (Figure 2a) [153,154,162]. The PBM-mediated increase in nitric oxide (NO) production could be one possible mechanism responsible for PBM-stimulation of the MLV functions. Indeed, PBM significantly increases NO generation in culture of isolated lymphatic endothelial cells [162]. The stimulating effects of PBM on MLVs are suppressed by the blockade of NO production [162]. How may NO promote contraction of lymphatic vessels? Traditionally, it is believed that NO suppresses lymphatic constriction. It is generally believed that NO causes relaxation of both blood and lymphatic vessels, suppressing their contractility. However, NO-related regulation of the lymphatic endothelium is much more complex than previously thought. It is known that the influx of fluid into the lymph vessel stimulates its contraction and NO production in the lymphatic endothelial cells increases in accordance with the intensity of vessel contractility [163]. Lymphatic constriction is accompanied by an elevated NO production in the lymphatic walls through an increased flow shear forces creating by coming fluids. In this case, NO causes dilation of the lymphatic endothelium after constriction, i.e., inhibits lymphatic pumping during high lymph flow. However, NO’s effects on different parts of the lymphatic vasculature are different. The lymphatic valves contain 50% more endothelial NO-synthase than tubular regions predominantly causing high NO production during the contraction of lymphatic vessels [163]. From a physiological perspective, during lymphatic constriction NO releases from the lymphatic valves into the lumen of the vessel and reaches tubular sites contributing their relaxation that is important for regulation of peristaltic pumping [163,164,165].",
            "The contraction phase of the lymphatic vessels depends on the opening of the Ca2+-channels, while the relaxation cycle is a component of local production of NO in the lymphatic endothelial cells that triggers by transiently elevated shear forces (Figure 2b). Ca2+ and NO cooperate in their regulation of lymph flow via mechanobiological mechanisms. During the contraction cycle, shear stress is increased and triggers activation of the endothelial NO synthase and NO production in the lymphatic valves. In this case, the elevated production of NO reduces intracellular Ca2+ concentration, leading to preparation of the lymphatic endothelial cells for subsequent relaxation. During the relaxation phase, due to the reduced fluid velocity in the now dilated vessel, NO production drops, which is accompanied by its rapid degradation. At this time, intracellular Ca2+ levels and membrane potentials are restored in preparation for another contraction of the vessels, which can be triggered by any signal able to initiate the opening of Ca2+ channels or Ca2+ flux from calmodulin (calcium-binding messenger protein) or through the gap junctions of neighboring cells (Figure 2b).",
            "We hypothesize that PBM can stimulate brain drainage and lymphatic clearance of macromolecules, including amyloids and viruses, from the brain due to PBM-mediated regulation of combination of mechanical and electrophysiological events associated with the pumping of the lymphatic vessels via PBM-mediated stimulation of NO production in the lymphatic endothelial cells (Figure 2c).",
            "Lipids play a crucial role in the structure and functioning of the brain. The brain contains the second highest amount of lipids after adipose tissue. However, the type of lipids found in the brain is different from that in adipose tissue, with phospholipids being the main component in the brain. The brain contains a significant amount of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid, arachidonic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid, which are mainly stored in phospholipids. These phospholipids are essential components of cell membranes and play a critical role in their proper functioning [166,167,168,169]. Cholesterol and phospholipids containing saturated fatty acids are concentrated in lipid rafts present in cell membranes. These rafts are involved in cell signaling. Membrane fluidity, supported by phospholipids consisting of unsaturated fatty acids, is crucial for membrane-associated functions. It includes the processing of amyloid precursor protein and plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of AD. The composition of phospholipids in cell membranes is involved in important neural functions, such as vesicular fusion and neurotransmitter release, which can be altered in AD [170,171,172,173].",
            "Among phospholipids, plasmalogens play an enormous role in maintaining brain homeostasis. They appear to be the missing link between the biochemical and functional abnormalities observed in AD and its pathological signs, such as the accumulation of Aβ in the brain [174,175,176,177].",
            "Plasmalogens are glycerophospholipids that are vital for brain function [178,179]. They are the primary structural components of lipoproteins, myelin, synaptic membranes, and cell membranes. Plasmalogens possess unique physicochemical characteristics that help regulate membrane fluidity, lipid packaging into lipoproteins, and interaction with nerve receptors and ion channels. These lipids are also necessary for synaptogenesis, myelination, and ion transport [180].",
            "Plasmalogens are synthesized in the peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum. The initial reaction involves the acylation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate by acyltransferase. Cells tightly regulate plasmalogen levels. Excessive levels of plasmalogens act as feedback inhibitors, reducing the levels of fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1. This reduction occurs by promoting the degradation of protein, which provides fatty alcohols in the synthesis [179,181]. Peroxisome biogenesis disorders affect the metabolism of lipids and reactive oxygen species, leading to symptoms such as hypomyelination due to low plasmalogen levels and increased inflammation. Cells with a deficiency in plasmalogen synthesis have low oxidation resistance, but adding alkylglycerol as a plasmalogen precursor can increase plasmalogen levels and enhance oxidative resistance [176].",
            "The emergence of age-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson’s disease, and AD are associated with oxidative stress and chronic neuroinflammation. The disruption of redox homeostasis leads to peroxisome malfunction and impaired plasmalogen production, which could be a mechanism of the development of age-related diseases [174,182,183].",
            "The level of plasmalogens in the brain increases until 30–40 years and then decreases sharply at about 70 years [184,185,186]. This age range coincides with the period of life when the incidence of AD increases exponentially [187,188,189]. Given the sharp decrease in brain plasmalogen levels with age and their critical role in maintaining brain homeostasis, it is not surprising that deficiency of plasmalogens in the brain is closely associated with the progression of aging-related neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and Parkinson’s disease [174,175,190].",
            "Oxidative cleavage of the vinyl ether bond by cytochrome C in the presence of H2O2 [191,192] is a potential mechanism of degradation of plasmalogens. A decrease in peroxisomal function combined with higher H2O2 levels potentially causes a permanent plasmalogen deficiency, which leads to membrane changes, signaling abnormalities, reduced neurotransmission, and suppressed antioxidant protection [193]. Oxidative stress associated with inflammation potentially exacerbates the degradation of plasmalogens by attacking the vinyl–ether bond, further reducing anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity of tissues and initiating an irreversible vicious circle that progresses to pathological abnormalities [175].",
            "During COVID-19 infection, the spike viral protein interacts with ACE2, which leads to the excessive production of angiotensin II and the activation of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. This subsequently leads to an increase in oxidative stress and release of inflammatory molecules [194]. Unlike other viral infections, COVID-19 infection severity is usually associated with age and may be linked to an imbalance in the redox system. This can cause an accumulation of oxidative damage and a decline in the antioxidant defense system, resulting in an increase in reactive oxygen species [195].",
            "Thus, plasmalogens, which reflect peroxisomes’ functional activity, can be used as biomarkers for diseases related to oxidative stress and aging, as well as a critical therapeutic target [182,196]. A study conducted by Yamashita et al. revealed that administration of Ascidian Viscera glycerophospholipid (EtnGpl), a plasmalogen-rich ethanolamine, to rats with an injected model of AD improves their learning ability and working memory through reducing oxidative stress in the brain [197]. Chronic injection of lipopolysaccharides in mice can lead to the activation of glial cells and accumulation of Aβ proteins in the brain that are associated with cognitive deficit. Hossain et al. clearly show that plasmalogens prevent neuronal cell death by activating protein kinase B and inhibiting caspase 3, improving neuronal survival [198,199]. Wood et al. found that the serum level of plasmalogens is significantly reduced in patients with AD and correlates with severity of dementia [200]. These data indicate that the circulating level of plasmalogens may be an indicator of the progression of AD.",
            "There is growing evidence suggesting improvement of cognitive deficits in both animals and humans with neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, scallop- and ascidian-derived plasmalogens can reduce the incidence of cognitive impairment in subjects with mild forgetfulness, AD and Parkinson’s disease due to an increase in the plasma ethanolamine plasmalogen (PlsEtn) levels [201,202,203,204]. Chicken-derived plasmalogens have similar effects in healthy people with mild memory problems [205]. Phosphatidylserine plasmalogen species attenuate cognitive disorders after cerebrovascular injury [206].",
            "The advantages of marine plasmalogens from ascidians, scallops, and sea cucumbers and the mechanisms underlying their beneficial effects on memory function are not well understood due to differences approaches in experiments, including dose, duration, and ethnicity of volunteers.",
            "In aged mice, marine plasmalogens ameliorate memory deficit via activation of neurogenesis [53]. Amyloid-mediated neuroinflammation is associated with a decrease in the brain PlsEtn levels leading to suppression of the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and reduced neurogenesis [207,208]. These changes promote the high expression of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) leading to neural death and neurite degeneration [207,209]. However, the administration of PlsEtn reduces Aβ depositions in the brain and tau hyperphosphorylation by attenuation of the p75NTR and PKCδ expression, which leads to reducing neuroinflammation [207,209,210].",
            "Chicken plasmalogens also enhance memory by attenuation of neuroinflammation [208,211]. However, marine PlsEtn enhances memory function better than chicken-derived plasmalogens, probably because marine PlsEtn is richer in DHA than the chicken derivative [208,210].",
            "It is noted that brain levels of PlsEtn containing DHA in the cortex correlate with cognitive abilities of rats with AD [197,212,213]. In vitro experiments have shown that PlsEtn bearing DHA exhibits strong suppression of neuronal inflammation, apoptosis, γ-secretase activity, and Aβ aggregation [212,213,214]. Interestingly, intravenously injected small-sized liposomes can increase the bioavailability of PlsEtn with DHA, enhancing their beneficial effects on locomotor activity in normal rats [215,216].",
            "Systemic administration of plasmalogens over 7 days reduces microglia inflammation induced by Aβ accumulation [217]. Longer treatment with scallop-derived plasmalogens over 15 months decreases both the expression of markers of inflammation and the protein kinase C-δ (PKCδ) involved in apoptosis [209]. Rothhaar et al. reported that murine plasmalogens reduce gamma-secretase activity in cell membranes isolated from post-mortem brain AD tissue [218].",
            "However, murine plasmalogens can be beneficial for AD and improvement of cognitive function due to an increase in the brain PlsEtn level and neurogenesis, leading to reducing amyloid accumulation, tau hyperpolarization attenuating neuroinflammation and neuron death (Figure 3).",
            "Current pharmacological therapy for AD includes use of cholinesterase inhibitors, anti-Aβ vaccine, and anti-neuroinflammation drugs [219,220,221]. Rivastigmine, galantamine, memantine, and donepezil are approved for treatment of AD [219,220,221]. However, these medications only partly improve quality of people with AD [222,223]. Monoclonal antibody anti-Aβ therapy, including aducanumab, lecanemab, and GV971, is a new strategy in therapy for AD in recent years. However, the safety and effectiveness of these drugs are still controversial, and these drugs are very expensive [224,225,226,227]. There are 43 new clinical drug trials registered in the National Library of Medicine database (ClinicalTrials.gov: accessed on 28 April 2024). However, the most common outcome was a lack of efficacy or only control of early symptoms of AD.",
            "Thus, no effective cure for AD currently exists, and available pharmacological strategies have shown limited effectiveness. Therefore, the search for new approaches to AD therapy is crucial to address the growing burden of this pathology. Medicinal herbs are a promising avenue for the treatment of AD [228,229,230,231,232,233]. Natural compounds were the first therapy used for AD [233]. Although the mechanisms of therapeutic effects of ayurvedic medicinal herbs remain largely unknown, extensive experimental and clinical studies on phytochemical actions have found a wide range of beneficial effects for AD within these plants [228,229,230,231,232,233]. There are several natural components exhibiting therapeutic effectiveness for AD, including flavonoids, polyphenols, sterols, alkaloids, triterpenes, lignans, and tannins with effects against to oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, amyloid deposition, and activity of cholinesterase.",
            "Here, we highlight the applications of various natural compounds as a novel treatment for AD (Figure 4).",
            "Turmeric is the root of Curcuma longa, and its main active ingredients are curcuminoids. The most important and most abundant of these curcuminoids is curcumin [234,235]. Curcumin has been approved by the FDA as a natural dietary supplement due to its safety and non-toxicity. Scientists’ interest in curcumin increased due to its unique molecular structure, which has multiple effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective actions [236]. It also has the ability to disaggregate tau proteins [237] and target amyloid plaques, which are one of the main causes of AD [238]. Studies have shown that among people aged 70–79, there is a 4.4-fold lower incidence of AD in India compared to the USA. This may be due to the fact that people in India consume more curry, which contains curcumin, and perform better on cognitive function tests [239].",
            "Piperine is an alkaloid found in black pepper (Piper nigrum) and long pepper (Piper longum) [239]. It has been found that piperine can increase the absorption of various drugs [240], and it has also been observed that when curcumin is taken with piperine, the absorption of curcumin increases by 154% in rats and 2000% in humans [241,242]. It has been shown to improve the solubility, stability, and absorption of curcumin. However, curcumin has a poor oral bioavailability. To improve oral curcumin delivery to the brain, self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (S-SNEDDS) have been developed using a nanotechnological approach [243]. In this study, the authors clearly demonstrate a significant dose-dependent therapeutic effect of combined curcumin with S-SNEDDS than drug alone in an AD model.",
            "Ginkgo biloba is commonly used in the treatment of AD cognitive impairment due to its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties [244,245]. Its leaves contain various essential components, such as flavonoids, steroids, organic acids, ginkgolides, and terpenoids. These compounds, including bilobalide and ginkgolide, are crucial for its therapeutic effects [246,247]. Flavone glycosides make up approximately 22–27% of the extract, while terpene lactones comprise about 5–7% [246]. Specific terpene lactone compounds include A, B, and C ginkgolides and bilobalide.",
            "Ginkgo biloba contains varies flavone glycosides, such as quercetin, isorhamnetin and kaempferol, that play a crucial role in preventing oxidative stress in AD [246]. The herb is thought to work through several mechanisms, including preventing apoptosis, reducing oxidative stress, inhibiting the formation of amyloid plaques, and scavenging free radicals. These actions help to prevent and treat AD. The plant extract also inhibits the neurotoxic effects of Aβ by regulating the activity of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. This helps to limit neuronal apoptosis, reduce the build-up of reactive oxygen species, and improve glucose uptake and mitochondrial function. It also prevents the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathways. There is convincing evidence that Ginkgo biloba can enhance cognitive function in patients with AD by improving oxygen supply to brain tissues and reducing the brain level of free radicals [246,247].",
            "Bacopa monnieri is a well-respected nootropic herb that has been used for centuries to treat neurological conditions. A chemical analysis of extract from Bacopa monnieri has revealed the presence of various bioactive compounds, including triterpenoids, alkaloids (such as nicotine, brahmine, and herpestine), saponins, glycosides, D-mannitol, herpaponin, monnierin, and alcohols. This plant also contains a variety of phytocompounds, such as bacosides A and B, bacosaponins A, B, C, bacosapeptides III to V, bacosapans D, E, F, jujubogenin, betulic acid, alkaloids, polyphenols, steroids, and sulfur compounds, all of which indicate its antioxidant properties. The antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of Bacopa monnieri make it a promising herb for AD. The main substances responsible for its neuroprotective effects are bacosides A and B due to their beneficial effects on the transmission of nerve signals and recovery of injured neurons [248]. The antioxidant activity of Bacopa monnieri also leads to an increase in various antioxidant molecules, including superoxide dismutase, thus reducing the harmful effects of H2O2-induced oxidative stress. In addition, this herb decreases lipoxygenase activity, assisting in the recovery from oxidative stress [249]. The diversity of bioactive compounds in Bacopa monnieri emphasizes its potential as a natural remedy for enhancing brain health and cognitive function.",
            "Salvia officinalis is a fragrant herb that is widely used in the treatment of AD [250,251]. Salvia contains more than 160 different polyphenolic compounds, including phenolic acids, and flavonoids. These include yunnaninic acid, lithospermum acids, salvianic acid, and others. It also contains flavonoids such as kaempferol, apigenin, and luteolin. In addition to these compounds, salvia is rich in terpenes such as alpha- and beta-thujones, 1,8-cineole, alpha-humulene, and camphor. These compounds can be found in the essential oils of the plant. Plants also contain significant quantities of diterpenes and triterpene acids, including tanshinones, carnosic acid, carnosol, and ursolic acid [249,250,251]. Salvia has great potential for promoting brain homeostasis and improving cognitive function. Indeed, Salvia officinalis has been shown to have anti-Aβ, anti-inflammatory and anxiolytic properties [249,250,251]. Salvia officinalis also demonstrates stimulating effects on the muscarinic and cholinergic pathways of the regulation of memory retention and formation, suggesting its supporting influences on cognitive properties.",
            "Melissa officinalis, also known as lemon balm, is a perennial herb with heart-shaped, bushy leaves that have a rough surface and grow upright [252,253]. The extracts from Melissa officinalis are rich in beneficial substances, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and triterpenes. Thanks to these substances, the plant exhibits pronounced sedative, anti-depressant, and anti-inflammatory effects [254].",
            "Studies have shown that lemon balm has the ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase and exhibit antioxidant activity, making it valuable in preventing and treating AD [252,253,254,255,256,257]. In addition, lemon balm has anticholinesterase activity, binds to cholinergic receptors, and exhibits neuroprotective properties [256]. Some substances in lemon balm interact with muscarinic acetylcholine and nicotine receptors, leading to a decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity [256]. By modulating the cholinergic system, lemon balm is a promising treatment for AD, as it has been observed to reduce arousal and improve cognitive function in people with mild to moderate AD [252,253,254,255,256,257,258].",
            "Huperzia A, an essential alkaloid extracted from H. serrata, can effectively cross the BBB and acts as a reversible and selective acetylcholine esterase inhibitor demonstrating anti-AD effects [259,260].",
            "MLVs play an important role in removal of wastes, metabolites, and toxins from the brain [44,45,46,47,48,49]. Therefore, MLVs are considered a promising target in therapy for brain diseases, including AD [43,44,45,46,47,48,49,128,129]. However, there are very limited pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods for augmentation of the MLV functions.",
            "Recently, it has been proposed to introduce VEGF-C into the cisterna magna as a new method of pharmacological stimulation of MLV function [43,44,118,119]. However, this method has several limitations: (i) it is an invasive and traumatic method; (ii) VEFG-C has different side effects; and (iii) there are only few positive results in clinical studies in this area [261].",
            "Herbal medicine has been proposed as alternative method in reducing lymphedema burden and drainage of different tissues [262,263]. Indeed, coumarin, juniper, black pepper, geranium, sage, and fennel are known to reduce swelling, and French oak wood extract containing robuvit leads to a sharp reduction in swelling [262]. Particular effectiveness of plant flavonoids has been shown in filarial lymphedema (edema of infectious origin) and in patients with breast cancer (edema of tumor origin) [264].",
            "It is assumed that plant substances can enhance the drainage function of the lymphatic system via activation of the mechanisms lymphoneogenesis, including the high expression of VEFG proteins. Thus, Panax pseudoginseng increases mRNA levels of VEGF-C and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3), leading to the stimulation and formation of new lymphatic vessels [265]. The stimulating effects on lymphangiogenesis have been found also for licoricidin, astragalus, and cinobufacini [263].",
            "Plant substances can also be used to improve the drainage function of MLVs. Borneol (C10H18O, molecular weight 154.25) can quickly penetrate the BBB and enter the brain after oral administration within 5 min and reaches maximum concentration in the brain within 1 h [266,267], with the most efficient accumulation in the cerebral cortex and slightly less in the hippocampus and the hypothalamus [268,269]. Some studies demonstrate the effectiveness of borneol in therapy for AD, stroke, and epilepsy [270,271,272,273,274]. Indeed, Borneol improves removal of amyloids from the brain due to activation of lymphangiogenesis leading to improvement of cholinergic regulation of memory function.",
            "The recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 amyloids can play a crucial role in COVID-19-exacerbated dementia. Once the virus has penetrated the brain, it stimulates production of amyloid deposits at both extracellular and intracellular spaces. The toxicity of the SARS-CoV-2 amyloids can directly damage the brain, leading to the development or the progression of AD dementia. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 amyloids may be targets for therapeutic approaches in prevention of COVID-19-mediated memory disorders and cognitive deficits. In this aspect, MLVs play a special role in the elimination of both amyloids and the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the brain [44,45,46,47,48,49,114]. It is actively being discussed whether increasing MLV functions will open a new page in the history of therapy for brain diseases associated with amyloidosis and lymphatic dysfunction, including AD, Parkinson’s disease, intracranial hemorrhages, brain trauma, and oncology [44,45,46,47,48,49,118,119,162,275,276]. However, this direction is in its infancy, which explains the limitation of technologies and pharmacological strategies for augmentation of MLVs to prevent or slow amyloidosis and MLV dysfunction. Among MLV stimulation technologies, the most promising is PBM because it is safe, without side effects, and approved by the FDA. There is emerging evidence suggesting that PBM effectively stimulates lymphatic removal of macromolecules, including Aβ and red blood cells from the brain as well as enhances brain’s drainage [153,154,155,156,157,162], leading to a significant improvement of memory function and cognitive properties in both healthy and AD subjects [128,157]. A pioneering direction is the development of portable technologies for PBM under the control of deep sleep. The animal and human data suggest that deep sleep is accompanied by strong activation of brain’s drainage and elimination of wastes and metabolites from the brain with the flow of brain fluids to the peripheral lymphatics [277,278]. It is obvious to assume that PBM of the MLV function and brain’s drainage will be most effective at the moment of their natural activation, i.e., during deep sleep [128,129]. Indeed, pilot results clearly show that PBM during deep sleep more effectively stimulates lymphatic removal of Aβ in an AD model and activates the brain’s drainage in both healthy mice and MLV-defective animals than PBM during wakefulness [45,128,129,151,157]. The use of PBM during sleep is also a promising direction in the treatment of brain tumors [279].",
            "Among the pharmacological strategies for increasing the MLV functions, the direction of increasing lymphangiogenesis by introducing VEGF-C into the cisterna magna is widely discussed [43,118,119]. However, this method has limitations due to its invasiveness, side effects, and unproven clinical effectiveness. Therefore, the development of new alternative strategies to stimulate the MLV functions and remove macromolecules from the brain is a priority in medicine. Plasmalogens are a unique class of phospholipids playing an important role in membrane structure and in neural functions. Interestingly, the level of plasmalogens in the brain is dramatically reduced in AD subjects and is one of key mechanisms responsible for AD. The growing evidence demonstrates that plasmalogens can help to prevent some of AD progression through suppression of amyloid and tau accumulation, reducing neuroinflammation and activation of neurogenesis leading to significant improvement of cognitive and memory properties [53,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218]. Plasmalogens also effectively increase resistance to chronic stress via activation of the immune system [280,281].",
            "Large families of medical herbs have emerged as promising avenues in the treatment of AD [234,235,236,237,238,239,240,241,242,243,244,245,246,247,248,249,250,251,252,253,254,255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274]. Although the mechanisms of their therapeutic action remain largely unknown, extensive studies have identified various beneficial compounds in their extracts, including flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, triterpenes with anti-inflammatory, anti-amyloidogenic, anticholinesterase, and antioxidant effects. These therapeutic effects suggest their potential as promising alternative treatments for AD and offer hope for addressing the difficulties posed by this incurable disease.",
            "Given the new challenges associated with the rapidly growing problems of brain damage by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, immediate solutions aimed at increasing the resistance of the brain and its immune system to the COVID-19-mediated brain injuries are required. Since it takes 10 to 15 years for new pharmacological drugs to appear on the market, non-pharmacological methods of treating brain dysfunction induced by COVID-19 infection, including the use of PBM, plasmalogens, and medicinal herbs, should be more actively studied to develop effective alternative strategies to help COVID-19 patients.",
            "Aβ is a normal product of neuronal metabolism eliminating from brain tissues through MLVs [44,45,128,129,151,157,277]. The conditions that can impair the function of lymphatic drainage processes, such as COVID-19 infection, or chronic sleep deprivation (less than 6 h), promote excessive accumulation of Aβ in brain tissues [3,4,29,30,128,129,282,283]. Recent findings have shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus-related accumulation of Aβ, which is identical to amyloids in AD, leads to the development of COVID-19-induced dementia [3,4,29,30]. Since virus-induced dementia develops quickly (in just a few weeks), it is logical to assume that this process may be reversible, as is the case with mild cognitive impairment [284,285,286,287,288,289]. Sleep deficiency over 20 years can lead to the development of dementia in 30% of cases, probably due to long-term Aβ deposition in brain tissues [283]. However, 70% of people experiencing chronic sleep deficiency do not develop dementia, indicating that they are either resistant to this process or it is reversible in them [283]. Thus, dementia and accumulation of Aβ in the brain associated with COVID-19 infection and sleep deficiency can be reversible and therefore treatable.",
            "There is evidence that the dissolved form of Aβ, located in the perivascular spaces, is most toxic to neurons and synapses [290]. Soluble Aβ is rapidly cleared from the human brain within 1–2.5 h [291]. However, this clearance is impaired in AD and other forms of dementia, leading to Aβ aggregation in the brain. Because MLVs play an important role in draining brain tissues and removing toxins and metabolites from the brain, future treatments for reversible forms of dementia are expected to involve stimulation of lymphatic drainage processes. Given the growing evidence of the existence of lymphatic vessels directly in the human brain [292,293,294,295], and not only in its meninges [296,297], technologies for activating lymphatic drainage processes will contribute to progress in the treatment of a wide number of brain diseases associated with dysfunction of the cerebral lymphatic system, such as AD, Parkinson’s disease, brain trauma and oncology [44,45,46,47,48,49,118,119,162,275,276].",
            "Recent animal studies have proposed PBM as an effective technology for stimulating the lymphatic clearance of Aβ and blood products [45,46,151,162,298,299]. However, PBM has limitations due to light scattering as it passes through the skull and the low doses used for photo-therapy [300]. Therefore, the use of PBM alone may not be sufficient to effective treat dementia, even if it is reversible. The alternative methods that could enhance the stimulatory effects of PBM may improve its therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we analyze the potential effectiveness of natural compounds, such as plasmalogens and medical herbs, to enhance lymphatic drainage processes in the brain. It is assumed that the combination of PBM and natural ingredients can become a reliable alternative in the treatment of various forms of reversible dementia.",
            "Unlike moderate dementia, dementia associated with AD is irreversible, and there are no prospects for the emergence of new methods for completely curing this disease. However, PBM has been shown to be effective in pilot clinical trials in controlling progression of AD [128,134,135,136,137,140,141,146,147,148,149,150]. It is expected that while the search for a reliable and safe pharmacological treatment for AD is underway, the combination of PBM with natural products will help prevent the rapid progression of the disease, as well as increase the brain’s resistance to the toxic effects of Aβ.",

The SARS-CoV-2 virus can enter the brain through the damaged BBB and bind the ACE2 receptor. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can enter the hippocampus through invasion of the olfactory neurons. Once it enters the brain, the SARS-CoV-2 virus promotes the accumulation of amyloids both in the extracellular space due to the spike protein binding to Aβs, and intracellularly by forming the SARS-CoV-2 amyloids from the structural (the spikes, envelop, membrane and nucleocapsid) and the accessory (ORF6 and ORF10) proteins.

            "SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, which has claimed millions of lives. This virus can infect various cells and tissues, including the brain, for which numerous neurological symptoms have been reported, ranging from mild and non-life-threatening (e.g., headaches, anosmia, dysgeusia, and disorientation) to severe and life-threatening symptoms (e.g., meningitis, ischemic stroke, and cerebral thrombosis). The cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme that belongs to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). RAS is an endocrine system that has been classically associated with regulating blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte balance; however, it is also involved in promoting inflammation, proliferation, fibrogenesis, and lipogenesis. Two pathways constitute the RAS with counter-balancing effects, which is the key to its regulation. The first axis (classical) is composed of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin (Ang) II, and angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) as the main effector, which -when activated- increases the production of aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone, sympathetic nervous system tone, blood pressure, vasoconstriction, fibrosis, inflammation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Both systemic and local classical RAS’ within the brain are associated with cognitive impairment, cell death, and inflammation. The second axis (non-classical or alternative) includes ACE2, which converts Ang II to Ang-(1–7), a peptide molecule that activates Mas receptor (MasR) in charge of opposing Ang II/AT1R actions. Thus, the alternative RAS axis enhances cognition, synaptic remodeling, cell survival, cell signal transmission, and antioxidant/anti-inflammatory mechanisms in the brain. In a physiological state, both RAS axes remain balanced. However, some factors can dysregulate systemic and local RAS arms. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 causes the internalization and degradation of this enzyme, reducing its activity, and disrupting the balance of systemic and local RAS, which partially explain the appearance of some of the neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19. Therefore, this review aims to analyze the role of RAS in the development of the neurological effects due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, we will discuss the RAS-molecular targets that could be used for therapeutic purposes to treat the short and long-term neurological COVID-19-related sequelae.",
            "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which mainly exhibits respiratory and cardiovascular complications and a range of neurological manifestations ranging from mild and non-life-threatening (e.g., headaches, anosmia, dysgeusia, and disorientation), to severe and life-threatening symptoms (e.g., meningitis, ischemic stroke, and cerebral thrombosis). Studies show that up to 80% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 present neurological complications during and even after the infection is overcome (Bauer et al., 2022). Potentially these complications are -partially- due to an imbalance in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) since, to infect the host cells, SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme belonging to non-classical RAS (Harapan and Yoo, 2021).",
            "RAS is one of the most complex hormonal systems regulating blood pressure, fluid, and electrolyte balance. However, it has recently been associated with multiple cellular mechanisms, including inflammation, proliferation, lipogenesis, and fibrogenesis. RAS consists of two regulatory pathways, the classical and non-classical, alternative, or protector pathway, which have opposing effects, being this the key to its function. Depending on the site of action, RAS can be either peripheral or local. Each of these systems has components that make them unique and play a critical role in health and disease.",
            "In COVID-19, the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 reduces this enzyme’s activity and disrupts the balance of RAS, therefore, the accumulation of Ang II leads to harmful effects. In that sense, the binding of Ang II to AT1R in the brain promotes the activation of pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant signaling pathways leading to endothelial dysfunction, thrombo-inflammatory processes, and reduction of cerebral irrigation, resulting in cerebrovascular complications (Tsivgoulis et al., 2020), which could partially explain the appearance of some of the neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19. Thereby, this review aims to analyze the role of RAS in the development of the neurological manifestations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and will discuss the RAS-molecular targets that could be used for therapeutic purposes to treat the short and long-term neurological COVID-19-related sequelae with particular emphasis on angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).",
            "Studies related to systemic RAS began in 1898 when renin was identified as a substance that increases blood pressure; however, it took about 50 years to identify all components of the classical RAS (Paul et al., 2006).",
            "Two pathways constitute RAS. The classical axis is composed of ACE, Ang II, and AT1R as the main effector that mediates the biological actions of Ang II (Campbell, 2014; Vargas Vargas et al., 2022). Renin, the first enzyme of RAS, is produced in the juxtaglomerular cells of the afferent renal arteriole in response to glomerular hypoperfusion. Circulating renin cleaves its substrate, angiotensinogen, to form the decapeptide Ang I, which is converted to Ang II by ACE (Campbell, 2014). The classical RAS axis contributes to pathophysiological changes, including excessive renal sodium reabsorption, abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell contraction, inappropriate cardiovascular responses, and excessive aldosterone secretion (Silva et al., 2017). The aldosterone can stimulate and recruit immunological cells such as monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells, favoring an inflammatory state and a T-cell response.",
            "The non-classical axis comprises ACE2, which acts mainly on Ang II and converts it into Ang-(1-7). ACE2 converts Ang-(1-7) from Ang II or can metabolize Ang I into Ang-(1-9); subsequently, Ang-(1-9) can then be transformed into Ang-(1-7) by the action of ACE. In parallel, the endopeptidases neprilysin, prolyl endopeptidase, and thimet oligopeptidase form Ang-(1-7) from Ang I (Chappell et al., 2014; Chappell, 2016; Rukavina Mikusic et al., 2021). Ang-(1-7) activates MasR, causing vasodilator, antiproliferative, antifibrotic, and anti-inflammatory effects (Campbell, 2014). Moreover, ACE2 hydrolyses non-RAS-derived plasma-borne and tissue-derived peptides, for instance: apelin-36, apelin-17, apelin-13, [Pyr1]apelin-13, kinetensin (1-9), dynorphin A 1-13, des-Arg9-bradykinin and neurotensin to apelin (1-35), apelin (1-16), apelin (1-12), [Pyr1] apelin (1-12), kinetensin (1-8), dynorphin A (1-12), des-Arg9-bradykinin (1-8) and [Pyr1] neurotensin (1-7) (Zhang et al., 2021). The apelin family comprises short-life peptides with anti-senescence, antithrombotic, and angiogenesis homeostasis properties. Moreover, peptides such as des-Arg9-bradykinin, neurotensin, dynorphin, and kinetensin are involved in inflammatory response (Zhang et al., 2021).",
            "More than three decades ago, researchers began to describe a specific RAS in many tissue types denominated tissue RAS (tRAS) or local RAS, whose imbalance is involved in the progression of various human pathologies (Saravi et al., 2021). It has been demonstrated that specific organs and tissues present a tRAS, such as kidneys, lungs, adipose tissue, liver, and brain (Paul et al., 2006). Thus, local RAS has been defined as “tissue-based mechanisms of Ang peptide formation that operate separately from the circulating RAS” (Campbell, 2014). Hence, local RAS can operate in an autocrine, paracrine, and intracrine manner and exhibit multiple physiological effects at cellular and tissue levels.",
            "In addition to hemodynamic actions, local RAS have multiple functions, including regulating cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), tissue inflammation and fibrosis, and hormone secretion. In that sense, the local RAS have alternative pathways regulated by biologically active peptides (e.g., Ang IV, Ang A, alamandine, and angioprotectin), additional specific receptors (e.g., pro-renin receptor), and alternative pathways for the generation of Ang II (e.g., renin-independent mechanisms of Ang peptide generation from Ang- (1-12) (Campbell, 2014). Furthermore, evidence suggests that local RAS may operate independently of the circulating RAS and play a pathogenic or protective role.",
            "Furthermore, it is essential to mention that both local and peripheral RAS show sex-related differences. This may partly stem from a differential balance in the classical and alternative axes of the RAS. In males, the ACE/AngII/AT1R pathways are enhanced due to testosterone influence, whereas, in females, the balance is shifted toward the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR and AT2R pathways by the influence of 17β-estradiol and/or progesterone (Hilliard et al., 2013). Evidence suggests that “premenopausal women, as compared to aged-matched men, are protected from renal and cardiovascular disease, and this differential balance of the RAS between the sexes likely contributes. On the other hand, ACE2 is located on the X chromosome in regions that usually escape the X chromosome inactivation; consequently, XX cells may over-express the gene encoding ACE2” (Gagliardi et al., 2020).",
            "This review will further describe the brain’s local RAS to analyze its association with the COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations.",
            "The brain has both peripheral and local RAS. Peripheral RAS from the forebrain pathway consists of capillaries that allow the access of RAS components to the brain at circumventricular organs, which lacks the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Fry and Ferguson, 2007). The evidence of local brain RAS (brain RAS) is the expression of RAS components such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), AT2R, and MasR in neurons and glia. Furthermore, brain RAS seems to be mediated by the third level of regulation since the neurons express their own organelle-specific RAS components (intracrine RAS or iRAS) (Labandeira-Garcia et al., 2021), and the brain has an exclusive isoform of renin named b-renin (Shinohara et al., 2016). Besides that, it has been demonstrated that the levels of renin are low in the brain; however, there are higher levels of secreted precursor form that provides catalytic properties like those of renin named prorenin, which can bind to prorenin receptors (PRRs) that are abundant within the brain (Grobe et al., 2008). Thus, local synthesis of RAS is essential, and astrocytes play a pivotal role in producing almost 90% of the brain’s angiotensinogen, secreted for conversion into Ang and then cleaved into various neuroactive peptides (Bodiga and Bodiga, 2013). There are four main neuroactive angiotensin-derived peptides within the brain: Ang II, Ang IV, Ang-(1-7), and alamandine (Jackson et al., 2018), as shown in Figure 1.",
            "Renin-Angiotensin-System in the brain. The cleavage of cerebral angiotensinogen produces four main neuroactive peptides: Ang II, Ang IV, Ang-(1-7), and alamandine. The upregulation of ACE leads to the hyperactivation of AT1R by Ang II conducing to brain vasoconstriction associated with cognitive impairment, cell death, and inflammation. In contrast, the binding of Ang II to AT2R, the bind of Ang IV, Ang-(1-7), and alamandine to AT4R, MasR, and MrgDR respectively, are related to enhancing cognition, synaptic remodeling, cell survival, cell signal transmission, and antioxidant/anti-inflammatory mechanisms leading to improvement of cognition.",
            "As in systemic RAS, in the brain RAS, Ang II results from angiotensinogen cleavage by renin to Ang I, then processed by ACE. This neuroactive peptide binds to AT1R, located on neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia of the cortex, and astrocytes. The upregulation of ACE leads to the hyperactivation of AT1R by Ang II, conducting to brain vasoconstriction associated with cognitive impairment, cell death, and inflammation (Labandeira-Garcia et al., 2017). AT1R promotes inflammation by the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of microglia; this activation also produces oxidative stress that activates programmed cell death in specific regions with cognition functions such as the cortex and hippocampus, conducing to cognition impairment (Wu et al., 2022; Figure 1). These effects are due to the increment in the ROS by the induction of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) and NOX4 axes (Peng et al., 2013). Contrary to the binding of Ang II to AT1R, the binding of Ang IV, Ang-(1-7), and alamandine to their respective receptors are related to enhancing cognition, synaptic remodeling, cell survival, cell survival, and cell signal transmission, and antioxidant/anti-inflammatory mechanisms (Figure 1).",
            "Ang IV is a product of the processing of Ang II by consecutive actions of aminopeptidase A and N to generate Ang III and subsequently Ang IV (Jenkins et al., 2007). This neuroactive peptide binds to angiotensin type 4 receptor (AT4R) and when in high concentrations, binds to AT1R (Wang et al., 2018). AT4R is restricted to neurons, an insulin-regulated aminopeptidase located in the basal ganglia, cortex, and hippocampus (Abrahão et al., 2019). Studies performed in animal models demonstrated that the Ang IV interacts with the brain hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met receptor system leading to improved cognition and increased hippocampal synaptic connectivity (Wright et al., 2015). Moreover, the intervention of Ang IV in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) contributes to the recovery of memory and cerebrovascular deficits (Royea et al., 2020).",
            "ACE2 is a critical enzyme in the role of vasodilation, cognition improvement, antiproliferative, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects within the brain producing Ang-(1-7) and alamandine [also known as (Ala1)-Ang-(1-7)] that bind to MasR and Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor of the type D (MrgD), respectively. Evidence suggests that the Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis shows favorable effects on cerebrovascular disease in animal models. For instance, the interaction between Ang-(1-7) and nitric oxide or bradykinin provides an antithrombotic activity that reduces the risk of ischemic stroke, mainly in older animals (Zheng et al., 2014). On the other hand, alamandine has a high affinity to MrgD; it is a neuroactive peptide formed by the decarboxylation of Ang-(1-7) and alternatively by the cleavage of angiotensin A (also known as [Ala1]-Ang II obtained by decarboxylation of aspartate to alanine on Ang II molecule) by ACE2 (Cosarderelioglu et al., 2020). The intervention of alamandine in in vitro and in vivo brain ischemia models protects from cellular damage, excitotoxicity, and cell death, showing its neuroprotective role (Gonçalves et al., 2022). Furthermore, in transgenic rats TGR (ASrAOGEN)680 with low brain angiotensinogen, the administration of alamandine induced an antidepressant-like effect measured by the immobility time in the forced swim test (Almeida-Santos et al., 2017). Moreover, cortex and hippocampal expression of Ang (1–7), MasR, and neuronal NO synthase is controlled by female sex hormones (Cheng et al., 2015), which may explain why premenopausal women have a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke when compared to men (Nakagawa and Sigmund, 2017).",
            "All the angiotensin receptors are expressed in neurons; however, it has been a matter of debate whether ACE2 is expressed in all types of neurons or not (Brann et al., 2020). Furthermore, neurons have their own intracellular or iRAS; at mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear levels. Neurons express RAS components such as AT1R, AT2R, and MasR. Interestingly, renin-b is an intracellular isoform of renin expressed only in the brain proposing the possibility of a third level of RAS exclusively for this organ (Shinohara et al., 2016). However, the deleterious or beneficial effects of iRAS and renin-b are unclear (Labandeira-Garcia et al., 2021).",
            "Although it has been barely explored, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has a particular profile of RAS. For instance, there is experimental evidence that angiotensinogen expression in the brain may be regulated independently of the peripheral angiotensinogen (produced by the liver), as it has been observed that chronic blockade of ACE decreased angiotensinogen levels in plasma but not in the CSF of spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar Kyoto rats (Schelling et al., 1983). Furthermore, in vitro, and in vivo measurements of CSF RAS components have revealed that Ang I is not generated in the CSF as renin appears unmeasurable within CSF. Accordingly, in this study, Ang I concentrations were low in CSF, while Ang II levels were comparable to those measured in plasma under control conditions (Schelling et al., 1980). In contrast, angiotensinogen and ACE were high. Furthermore, a recent study conducted by Kehoe et al. (2019) has revealed that an imbalance in the CSF RAS components is associated with disease pathology in AD. This observational study indicates that CSF ACE activity is elevated in AD and positively correlated with CSF ACE2 (Kehoe et al., 2019).",
            "Interestingly, CSF ACE2 activity was positively associated with normal aging. Moreover, authors found in AD patients moderately strong associations between CSF ACE activity and platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor (sPDGFR), a marker of pericyte damage, and between CSF ACE2 activity and CSF albumin levels, a marker of BBB leakiness (Kehoe et al., 2019). On the other hand, in a study conducted by Xu et al., it was observed that ACE2 is the main enzyme converting Ang II into Ang-(1-7) in human CSF; also, the authors found that ACE2 is elevated in the CSF of hypertensive patients and that its levels correlated with systolic pressure (Xu et al., 2017).",
            "Although there are few studies on the RAS components in the CSF, the evidence suggests that this fluid has specific characteristics that must be regulated since an -acute or chronic- imbalance of its components favors the classic RAS axis, which is associated with impairment of the BBB, which can lead to the development of neurological diseases. In this sense, specific components of RAS could serve as biomarkers in the CSF that help diagnose and treat neurological disorders associated with COVID-19.",
            "In addition, the complexity of the RAS in the brain increases because, even when the ACE2 expression has been reported in several organs, including the human brain, the cell-specific expression pattern is still unknown. According to transcriptome meta-analysis, ACE2 is expressed in several brain regions, from the stratium (choroid plexus to paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus) to the cortex (the middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex) (Kabbani and Olds, 2020). Recent studies show that the higher expression of ACE2 is in the pons and medulla oblongata in the human brainstem (Lukiw et al., 2022). In contrast, in vitro studies using human CD31+ brain endothelial cells show that the expression of ACE2 is below the threshold of detection; however, the expression increases under fluid shear stress in the 3D model system, and this increment favors the SARS-CoV-2 infection through spike protein. Therefore, the ACE2 expression could be variable due to the differences in an arterial or venous steady flow in the brain in a specific manner determining the individual risk for neurological complications during or after the infection by SARS-CoV-2 (Kaneko et al., 2021).",
            "SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus belonging to the same subgenus as the SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Cascella et al., 2022). SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, non-segmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome of 30 kilobases that encodes 7,096 aminoacids that constitute four structural proteins [spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N)], and 15 non-structural proteins (NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5, NSP6, NSP7, NSP8, NSP9, NSP10, NSP12, NSP13, NSP14, NSP15, and NSP16), and eight accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8b, 9b, and ORF14) (Lamptey et al., 2021; da Silva Torres et al., 2022).",
            "SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV, ACE2; however, the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for ACE2 is about 20 times higher than that of SARS-CoV, which partially explains its higher transmissibility (Huo et al., 2020). The entry route for SARS-CoV-2 into host cells is through the Spike (S) protein, which binds to ACE2 on host cells. The S protein is a homotrimer composed of monomers of an N-terminal S1 subunit (responsible for binding to the receptor) and a C-terminal S2 subunit (responsible for fusion with the host cell membrane). On the other hand, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of protein S directly interacts with ACE2 (Huo et al., 2020). The S protein is initially prefused where the S1 domains cover the top of S with the RBD located at the tip. The RBD is predominantly in an “inactive” state. The receptor-binding site is inaccessible; however, it undergoes conformational changes that cause it to rotate with a hinge-like motion, thus transiently presenting the ACE2 receptor-binding site (Huo et al., 2020). When ACE2 is blocked, it keeps RBD “up,” so the S1 layer becomes destabilized. This possibly favors conversion to a post-fusion form, in which S2, through massive conformational changes, drives its domain from upward fusion to dock with the host membrane (Huo et al., 2020). After fusion occurs, type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2), present on the host cell surface, removes ACE2 and activates receptor-bound S proteins; this will cause conformational changes that allow the virus to enter cells (Astuti and Ysrafil, 2020). After entering cells, SARS-CoV-2 releases its genomic material into the cytoplasm, where the viral replication process will begin (Astuti and Ysrafil, 2020; Pastrian-Soto, 2020).",
            "The incubation period of COVID-19 goes from 5 to 6 days but can be up to 14 days. During this period (“pre-symptomatic” period), the infected individuals can be contagious and transmit the virus to healthy individuals in the population. After this time frame, many COVID-19 patients manifest a range of signs and symptoms such as fever, body aches, breathlessness, malaise, and dry cough; on the other hand, patients may present with asymptomatic, mild, moderate, or severe disease (Parasher, 2021). Furthermore, some patients also experiment neurological complications, which include confusion, stroke, and neuromuscular disorders, that generally appear during acute COVID-19. However, more severe symptoms such as impaired concentration, headache, sensory disturbances, depression, and even psychosis may persist for months after infection, causing “long COVID” neuropsychiatric syndromes (Zubair et al., 2020). The pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood, although evidence implicates immune dysfunction, including non-specific neuroinflammation and antineuronal autoimmune dysregulation. Also, dysregulation of systemic and brain RAS has been pointed out as a possible cause of the neurological COVID-19 manifestations.",
            "Interestingly, it has been reported that there are some sex- and gender-related differences linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Prinelli et al., 2022). Male patients frequently have severe COVID-19 symptoms such as fever and pneumonia, leading to worse disease progression. However, females are more likely to present atypical symptoms characterized by sore throat/rhinorrhea, gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, conjunctivitis, and palpitations that are associated with less severe outcomes (Prinelli et al., 2022). These sex differences rely on the disparities in immune responses throughout life, which are influenced by age and reproductive status. It seems that females are less susceptible to infections than their male counterparts. Female hormones (estrogens and progesterone) suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which are associated with the COVID-19 cytokine storm.",
            "Furthermore, high estrogen concentrations in premenopausal women might lead to an overexpression of ACE2 in females, protecting them by inducing anti-inflammatory responses. On the contrary, low estrogen levels in males may contribute to higher disease susceptibility and death rates (Prinelli et al., 2022). “Androgens could also promote the transcription of the TMPRSS2 gene facilitating viral entry into the cells and decreasing the antibody response to viral infections” (Prinelli et al., 2022).",
            "SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the respiratory system (Chen et al., 2020). Nevertheless, increasing evidence confirms that it also invades the central nervous system (CNS), detecting neurological involvement among several cases of SARS-CoV-2, with an incidence of 36.4% (Mao et al., 2020). Although neurological manifestations are primarily seen in severe cases of COVID-19, it was shown that CNS involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection could be observed in non-severe patients because a CNS invasion can occur in both the initial and late phases of SARS-CoV-2 disease (Baig et al., 2020).",
            "Several studies suggest that the neurological symptoms result from the virus outside the CNS because of the inflammatory mediators that this infection triggers. However, new evidence confirms that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may also enter the brain through different pathways (Zhou et al., 2020).",
            "The CNS infection by SARS-CoV-2 can be direct or indirect through several routes: (1) retrograde axonal transport and trans-synaptic viral spreading, (2) via hematogenous considering the leakage of the BBB, (3) by the brain lymphatic drainage system (“Trojan horse” mechanism), and 4) through circumventricular organs that lack the BBB. In the following sections, we will briefly describe these mechanisms (Figure 2).",
            "Neurological symptoms as consequence of classical RAS upregulation in COVID-19 patients. The lack of Ang II processing by ACE2 and its subsequent binding to AT1R can cause a local pro-inflammatory state that activates neuronal programmed cell death and the consequent dopaminergic neuronal loss leading to cognitive problems. Accumulating evidence indicates that brain areas unaffected by the virus show a low AT1R expression accompanied by high AT2R expression. Then, Ang II can bind to AT2R with high affinity, triggering protective mechanisms such as neuronal survival. Although previous information suggested that peripheral sensory neurons did not express ACE2, recent evidence indicates that these cells express low ACE2 levels, which may favor viral entry and infection. Subsequently, the infection leads to altered expression of genes associated with chemosensory functions, such as the olfactory neuronal markers, fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein (FLRT3), drebrin 1 (DBN1), taste 2 receptor member 31 (TAS2R31), chemosensory regulatory factors Yin Yang 1 (YY1), and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1). Moreover, the musculoskeletal symptoms in COVID-19 patients could be related to Ang II upregulation that orchestrates protein degradation and skeletal muscle cell apoptosis, possibly leading to loss of skeletal muscle fibers.",
            "Some viruses (e.g., adenovirus and α-herpes viruses) can migrate by infecting sensory or motor nerve endings, achieving retrograde or anterograde neuronal transport with the support of motor proteins (e.g., dynein and kinesins), which move along microtubules. Therefore, it has been proposed that SARS-CoV-2 could also have these transportation mechanisms to invade the CNS (Bodro et al., 2021). Since the olfactory nerve communicates the nasal epithelium and the olfactory bulb, viruses may enter the CNS this way (Swanson and McGavern, 2015; Meinhardt et al., 2020). Experimental data have demonstrated that coronaviruses can anterogradely reach the nervous system by crossing the neural-mucosal interface through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone (Rhea et al., 2020). In this context, SARS-CoV-2 can spread from the olfactory epithelium along the olfactory nerve to the olfactory bulb via the transcribral route, where it reaches the brain and might infect adjacent structures (Rhea et al., 2020). Retrogradely, the droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 particles that get in touch with nasal mucosa are moved along the microtubules back to neuronal cell bodies through trans-synaptic transport or via the fast axonal transport mechanism of vesicle transport (Zubair et al., 2020). Once the virus has crossed through the cribriform plate to reach the brain parenchyma, it might continue being transported to many other areas, such as the olfactory cortex of the temporal lobe to the hippocampus, and the amygdala or hypothalamus (Cheng et al., 2020). It can also penetrate the medulla oblongata’s cardiovascular control center (Meinhardt et al., 2020). The axonal transport and neuronal trans-synaptic propagation could be from olfactory, gustatory, trigeminal, and vagal nerves, allowing the virus to infect the brainstem in the early stages of infection (Pacheco-Herrero et al., 2021). In this pathway, primary sensory neurons communicate with the mitral cells, which have projections toward the ventricle and the medulla, leading to the spread of the virus from the CSF into the lymphatic system within the CNS and toward the peripheral nervous system (Dey et al., 2021). The trigeminal nerve branch could play a critical role, as it innervates the nociceptive cells in the nasal cavity and sensory fibers in the conjunctiva. Furthermore, the trigeminal nerve branch can carry out drug transportation, thus demonstrating the ability to endocyte, move, and exocyte proteins from a nerve ending, using the motor proteins kinesin and dynein in a retrograde way to reach the CNS (Lochhead et al., 2019).",
            "Hematogenous spread occurs because of the BBB leakage, which favors the entrance of viral particles into the CNS. The BBB integrity is primarily composed of junctional complexes containing tight adherents and gap junctions, which, when damaged, cause an increase of the permeability mainly through paracellular via (Luissint et al., 2012). The mechanisms of BBB disruption are diverse. Regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, hypoxia, ischemia, and oxidative stress are common mechanisms associated with active disease (Rojas et al., 2020), which are reported to easily affect the intercellular junctions, leading to the disruption of the BBB (Sántha et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2018; Halder and Milner, 2020). At the same time, some cytokines are characterized to increase paracellular permeability per se (Pan et al., 2007). Blood-borne cytokines can directly cross the BBB to interact with CNS tissue (Hsuchou et al., 2012; Erickson et al., 2020). In this context, cytokines and acute phase reactants produced during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-17, IFN-γ, and acute-phase protein CRP have been experimentally proven to increase the BBB permeability (Hsuchou et al., 2012; Erickson et al., 2020).",
            "Furthermore, the entry of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain can lead to microglial activation and proliferation that can fragment endothelial tight junction protein, further disrupting BBB’s integrity (John et al., 2003; Shigemoto-Mogami and Hoshikawa, 2018). The disruption of the BBB could, then, create tissue inflammation and release more pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, resident nervous system cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, release these pro-inflammatory cytokines (Van Wagoner et al., 1999; Libbey and Fujinami, 2011; Welser-Alves and Milner, 2013). Thus, creating a self-perpetuation neuro-inflammatory milieu (Dantzer, 2018).",
            "Moreover, it has been proposed that SARS-CoV-2 can attack via ACE2 receptors in the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the brain, disrupting the BBB and increasing the BBB permeability (Keyhanian et al., 2021). This mechanism is supported by the fact that viral-like particles of SARS-COV-2 have been found in Post-mortem brain endothelial capillary pericytes of COVID-19 patients (Bocci et al., 2021).",
            "Additionally, to the BBB, SARS-CoV-2 can infect the CNS by disrupting the CSF barrier (BCSFB). The CSF constantly exchanges fluids with the blood and the interstitial fluid in a pulsatile movement throughout the brain (Brinker et al., 2014). Moreover, the BCSFB cells could activate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to BCSFB permeability that provokes the free transit of immune cells that potentially are infected, as occurs in the mentioned “Trojan horse” mechanism, which will be reviewed below.",
            "It has been confirmed that when SARS-CoV-2 is in an adequate milieu, it can live in human macrophages and dendritic cells from the periphery of germinal lymph nodes and peripheral blood (Yang et al., 2020; Meidaninikjeh et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2021). Post-mortem examination of airway tissue confirmed that viral particles and antigens of SARS-CoV-2 are present in alveolar macrophages (Junqueira et al., 2021). Through the lymphatic drainage system, monocytes and macrophages become a viral pool that might diffuse the virus toward the CNS (Desforges et al., 2007). In the case of the macrophages, it is well known that the virus might convert these cells into long-living macrophages and promote their migration to become a viral reservoir and a vector to successfully transport the virus to hard-reachable places, including the brain (Nikitina et al., 2018; Badierah et al., 2020).",
            "A potential way of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS is by binding to ACE2, which has been reported to be expressed on various brain cells and cerebral parts such as the subfornical organ, paraventricular nucleus, nucleus of the tractus solitarius, and rostral ventrolateral medulla, as well as in non-cardiovascular areas such as the motor cortex and raphe (Jakhmola et al., 2020). Some of these areas lack BBB, especially those close to the third and fourth ventricles that comprise circumventricular organs, hypothalamus, and brainstem, constantly exchanging fluids with the blood and the CSF (Quarleri and Delpino, 2022).",
            "The effects of the RAS dysregulation surpass the renal and cardiovascular systems to encompass other body tissues and organs, including the brain (Noureddine et al., 2020). Thus, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2-infected patients can have a significant functional impairment of RAS (Osman et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022a), which is a consequence of the binding of SARS-CoV-2’ RBD of the viral S protein, precisely, the S1 subunit to the ACE2 enzyme in human cells. As a result of this interaction, ACE2 is shedded by A disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), releasing it into circulation as the soluble form of ACE2 (sACE2) (Gonzalez et al., 2021). In that sense, it has been observed that sACE2 levels increase for at least 14 days in patients with COVID-19 infection, particularly in critically ill subjects, and are higher in males than in females (Fagyas et al., 2022). However, it is essential to mention that most of these were hypertensive patients, which could represent a significant bias. Moreover, Wang et al. reported that the levels of sACE2 significantly “decreased in survivors but increased in patients who died due to COVID-19” (Wang et al., 2022). On the other hand, it has been reported that COVID-19 patients show a prominent downregulation of ACE2 expression in the vascular endothelium, accompanied by immune infiltration and myocardial fibrosis (Bois et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022a).",
            "Furthermore, it has been suggested that because of an impaired ACE2, dysregulation in the balance of the levels of its substrates and products in both plasma and tissues may occur (Osman et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022). For instance, due to the decreased ACE2 hydrolytic activity, Ang II increases over Ang-(1-7), therefore overstimulating the AT1R and over activating the classical axis of RAS, which can eventually translate into hypertension, thrombosis, lung edema, fibrosis, and hyper−inflammatory reactions (Pucci et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). The AT1R overactivation also exacerbates inflammatory response by the microglia conducing to the release of glutamate from nerve cells, increasing the production of ROS and NOS, which produce BBB permeability and the consequent neutrophil and T cell infiltration to the ischemic region leading to sepsis and neurotoxicity (Kaushik et al., 2020).",
            "Ang II has hydrophilic features; therefore, it does not cross the BBB. Although, elevated circulating levels of Ang II in certain pathologic conditions, such as hypertension, provoke disruption of the BBB integrity, allowing access to circulating Ang II (Katsi et al., 2020). Evidence “suggests that peripheral and local RAS, via disruption of the BBB may promote exacerbated sympatho-excitatory activity and neurogenic hypertension” (Katsi et al., 2020). Another molecule crucially involved in the RAS is aldosterone. Besides being produced in the adrenal gland, evidence suggests that extra-adrenal tissues may synthesize aldosterone as it occurs with the brain. Brain tissue from mice exposed to a high-sodium diet shows an increased CYP11B2 expression, indicating that sodium could regulate the expression of aldosterone in this organ (Geerling and Loewy, 2009; Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2010). Currently, few studies have demonstrated the relationship between aldosterone and the severity of COVID-19; it is known that high levels of aldosterone in elderly patients could increase the risk of mortality from cardiovascular complications due to its proinflammatory and atherosclerotic functions (Campana et al., 2022).",
            "Human brain pericytes, critical components of the BBB, have been shown to express both AT1R and AT2R, with a predominant expression of AT1R (Noureddine et al., 2020). Both receptors mediate the response of pericytes to Ang II, characterized by increased production of Nox4, accompanied by an elevation of ROS. ROS increase BBB permeability by impeding the expression or function of the tight junction proteins; it also contributes to adverse vascular remodeling and vessel rarefaction that disturbs blood flow (Noureddine et al., 2020). Furthermore, Ang II might trigger pericyte loss and promote BBB impairment (Noureddine et al., 2020). The BBB leakiness leads to the accumulation of serum proteins, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) activation, endothelial transcytosis, microglial activation, and aberrant TGF-β/Smad2 signaling activation, which together provoke brain damage (Sun et al., 2021). Also, BBB damage could make it more permeable to SARS-CoV-2 SNC invasion.",
            "Moreover, Ang II is considered one of the primary atherosclerotic mediators. It regulates the expression of adhesion molecules (e.g., VCAM-1, ICAM-1, P-selectin), cytokines, chemokines, and the secretion of growth factors within the arterial wall (Montecucco et al., 2009). On the other hand, RAS can regulate the activation of the complement system in both atherosclerosis and renal injury (Montecucco et al., 2009). Hosomi et al. (2005) demonstrated that intravenous infusion of Ang II increases cerebral edema and mortality after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (Hosomi et al., 2005). These results suggest that the accumulation of Ang II leads to endothelial dysfunction, which could produce severe cerebrovascular manifestations such as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), ischemia stroke (IS), and hemorrhagic stroke (HS) (it is calculated that the combined prevalence of cerebrovascular diseases in COVID-19 patients is ranging between 0.5 and 5%) (Tsivgoulis et al., 2020).",
            "Another group of peptides that ACE2 metabolizes is apelins’. It has been reported that parental apelins induce the internalization of the apelin receptor (APLNR), which is mediated by β−arrestin signaling (Zhang et al., 2021). On the other hand, metabolized apelins signal toward the Gi pathway of the APLNR rather than the β−arrestin−induced internalization pathway. There is increasing evidence that ACE2 down−regulation derived from COVID−19 causes higher concentrations of parental apelin peptides and lower levels of metabolized apelins, thus interfering with “the beneficial anti−senescence, antithrombotic and angiogenesis homeostasis effects of the apelinergic system” due to the internalization of the APLNR (Zhang et al., 2021). Instead, the dysregulation of systemic apelins levels favoring parental apelins may cause some effects in the SNC, such as loss of structure or function of neurons, pro-inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, Ca2+ signaling, apoptosis, and autophagy (Luo et al., 2020).",
            "Likewise, the peripheral accumulation of des−Arg9−bradykinin after ACE2 down-regulation in COVID-19 may provoke “neutrophil infiltration and inflammation, and increased fluid permeability into tissues causing edema” (Seltzer, 2020; Zhang et al., 2021). Also, kinetensin may exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 infection, inducing mast cell degranulation characterized by the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators that increase vascular permeability, causing edema. Recently, an in vitro study of the BBB carried out in “human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells” revealed that the BBB permeability is increased in response to neurotensin and bradykinin (Karamyan, 2021). Hence, in the COVID-19 context, these two peptides increase, making BBB prone to damage.",
            "Once again, concerning COVID-19-associated neurological symptoms, it has been widely reported that females show a higher number of long-term persistent physical, cognitive, neurological, and neuropsychiatric symptoms than males (Jensen et al., 2022). Besides the underlying mechanisms that explain these sex disparities, authors have proposed that they rely on immune and RAS mechanisms, as well as age, as mentioned in previous sections. However, the biological and molecular explanations should be studied in more depth.",
            "As shown in this section, various studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes deregulation of the systemic RAS that favors the classical axis of this system. Likewise, evidence has been presented that this type of imbalance in RAS could affect the integrity of the BBB and cause oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and autophagy, which cause brain damage that can have acute clinical manifestations. If the balance in the RAS is not restored, this could develop neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, regulating RAS might be a new therapeutic target to protect SNC from neural diseases. However, it is essential to note that these are still hypotheses as most of the available results derive from measurements in plasma and are only stratified by sex; thus, more studies are needed to determine the molecular mechanism in a tissue-specific manner, in this case in the brain.",
            "The infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been deeply associated with neurological symptoms, possibly due to brain RAS imbalance (Harapan and Yoo, 2021).",
            "As mentioned before, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dysfunction of alternative RAS, contributing to the accumulation of Ang II and favoring the classical signaling pathway regulated by Ang II/AT1R. The lack of Ang II processing by ACE2 favors the binding of this peptide to AT1R, which can cause a local pro-inflammatory state that activates neuronal programmed cell death and the consequent dopaminergic neuronal loss, which could have some consequences as cognitive problems in patients recovered from COVID-19 as is shown in Figure 2 (Khezri and Ghasemnejad-Berenji, 2021). Besides the increment of inflammation, the upregulation of Ang II could elevate the oxidative stress levels leading to an impairment in the brain endothelial function, which could produce difficulties in learning and memory (Quarleri and Delpino, 2022). Classical studies in animal models show that the microinjection of losartan (an AT1R inhibitor) and Ang II unilaterally and bilaterally in the CA1 hippocampal area improves memory and learning in shuttle-box and step through behavioral test compared to control animals (Tashev and Stefanova, 2015). Though controversial, authors say that these observations may be explained by the fact that Ang II can bind both AT1R and AT2R; therefore, the blockade of AT1R would enhance the binding of Ang II to AT2R and, consequently, its activation, leading to the beneficial effects.",
            "Although controversial, several studies show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect brain endothelial cells inducing vascular endothelialitis. Once the virus infects the endothelial cells of large cerebral arteries, it may induce a pathological activation of ADAM17. This may potentiate inflammation and diminish ACE2-mediated tissue protection through proteolytic shedding, preventing the Ang II processing within the brain tissue (Wang et al., 2022). Hence, Ang II triggers a thromboinflammatory process by incrementing ROS, pro-inflammatory cytokines expression, and vasoconstriction by the decrease in blood vessel diameter. This vasoconstriction reduces cerebral microcirculation, which could decrease cerebral irrigation, conducing to brain damage (El-Arif et al., 2021). A low expression of AT1R characterizes brain areas unaffected by the viral infection. Contrary, in these areas, AT2R is upregulated; thereby, Ang II can bind to this receptor with high affinity, triggering protective mechanisms such as neuronal survival (Figure 2; Fajloun et al., 2022).",
            "Less urgent but more prevalent neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are anosmia and dysgeusia; the calculated prevalence for smell and taste disturbances varies according to the study ranging from 38.5–85.6% and 35.8–88.0%, respectively (Harapan and Yoo, 2021). Studies using human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived peripheral neurons show that these disturbances may be due to the direct infection of SARS-CoV-2 to peripheral sensory neurons, which were thought not to express ACE2; however, it has been determined that ACE2 expression is low but not zero in these cells. Furthermore, this study determined that the infection leads to the deregulation in the expression of genes associated with chemosensory functions, such as the olfactory neuronal marker genes fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein (FLRT3), debrin 1 (DBN1), Taste 2 receptor member 31 (TAS2R31), chemosensory regulatory factors Yin Yang 1 (YY1), cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1), among others as is shown in Figure 2 (Lyoo et al., 2022).",
            "Headache is considered a non-specific symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, COVID-19 patients who had never suffered from recurrent headaches before experience persistent incapacitating frequent headaches due to the virus infection (Harapan and Yoo, 2021). The co-localization of Ang II in the rat neurons and the human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) with substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) proposes the regulation of Ang II in nociception (Patil et al., 2010). However, the mechanism involved in headaches due to SARS-CoV-2 has still not been elucidated (Dos Anjos de Paula et al., 2021).",
            "Finally, myalgia, arthralgia, and fatigue are common musculoskeletal symptoms in COVID-19 patients (Tuzun et al., 2021). The relationship between these neurological manifestations and the classical RAS axis can be given by the induction of wasting skeletal fiber through the increment in protein degradation, the triggering of apoptosis, and the decrement of protein synthesis regulated by Ang II. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that Ang II inhibits satellite cell proliferation (muscle stem cells) and prevents skeletal muscle regeneration (Figure 2; Yoshida et al., 2013). An upregulation of Ang II has been proved in muscle pathologies such as sarcopenia and cachexia (Bahat, 2020).",
            "According to the evidence above, the RAS is one of the main therapeutic targets in the battle against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, studies encompassing genetic and pharmacological manipulation of RAS components suggest that targeting this system may be beneficial by slowing or reversing neurological dysfunctions secondary to COVID-19. As in any new disease, before we can develop new treatments and therapies, we must first deploy a “drug repurposing strategy” according to the available information. In that sense, several existing drugs target the different members of the RAS, modifying the balance mentioned above between the anti- and pro-inflammatory pathways controlled by the RAS. Of these drugs the ones that received particular attention in the initial months of the current pandemic were ACE inhibitors and ARBs (Arcos et al., 2020; Leclézio et al., 2020; Murray et al., 2021). ACE inhibitors commonly treat hypertension, heart failure, and myocardial infarction (Ooi and Ball, 2009). As their name implies, these drugs inhibit the conversion of Ang I to Ang II by ACE, reducing blood pressure, sodium retention, and cell growth (Messerli et al., 2018).",
            "Moreover, Ang-(1-7) can be metabolized by ACE to Ang-(1-5). Therefore, the blockage of ACE would increase Ang-(1-7) levels. Also, shunting Ang I processing to Ang-(1-7) via neprilysin or thimet oligopeptidase would increase this peptide in the brain (Chappell, 2019).",
            "On the other hand, ARBs directly antagonize Ang II at the AT1 receptors; these were developed as an alternative for patients unable to tolerate the adverse effects of ACE inhibitors, such as persistent cough (Momoniat et al., 2019). Since ACE inhibitors and ARBs increased the expression of ACE2, which acts as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, there was increasing concern by some researchers that their use could lead to an increase in SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms and mortality (Fang et al., 2020; Patel and Verma, 2020). However, this does not seem to be the case, as new evidence showed that these do not affect the patient’s prognosis (Nouri-Vaskeh et al., 2021; Tleyjeh et al., 2022). Some researchers even proposed that the increase in ACE2 expression might be beneficial, thinking that one of the leading causes of severe symptoms is the downregulation of ACE2, caused by its internalization induced by SARS-COV-2 attachment to this receptor (Kow et al., 2020). As mentioned above, this process modifies the delicate equilibrium of the RAS, promoting vasoconstriction and pro-inflammatory response by Ang II. The increased concentration of ACE2 by ACE inhibitors and ARBs might return the RAS to balance, reducing the damaging inflammatory response (Tleyjeh et al., 2022).",
            "Furthermore, ARBs have shown neuroprotective effects in different in vivo disease models, including that traumatic brain injury, stroke, dementia, and AD (Noureddine et al., 2020). However, it is essential to take into account that BBB-crossing ARBs (e.g., telmisartan, candesartan) or ACE inhibitors (e.g., captopril, lisinopril, fosinopril, perindopril, ramipril, trandolapril) (Glodzik and Santisteban, 2021) may show better results in neurologic, cognitive and memory impairments caused by COVID-19. The meta-analysis of several clinical studies reveals that using ARBs in COVID-19 patients is associated with reducing mortality (Guo et al., 2020). Moreover, the treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs favored the reduction of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels in patients with COVID-19 and hypertension (Cheng et al., 2020). For these reasons, ARBs and ACE inhibitors are currently approved as alternative treatments against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Kulkarni et al., 2022).",
            "Another drug that affects the RAS is the renin inhibitor aliskiren. It inhibits the ability of renin to form angiotensin I by blocking the RAS at its origin (Wal et al., 2011). Being rarely prescribed, there is not enough information about the possible therapeutic role of this drug. However, molecular docking analysis suggests that aliskiren can block SARS-CoV-2 main protease Mpro, which is essential for viral replication (Aly, 2020), although further clinical evaluation is necessary. Likewise, it has been reported that aliskiren upregulates cell viability and reduces inflammatory damage and apoptosis induced by Aβ accumulation in in vivo AD models (Chen et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2021).",
            "Another strategy is enhancing the Ang-(1-7)/MasR pathway instead of the Ang II/AT1R pathway. Firstly, Ang (1–7) increases oxygen delivery to the brain through the cerebral microvessels by stimulating angiogenesis and enhancing blood flow via the upregulation of NO production (Noureddine et al., 2020). In a study by Xiao et al., it was observed that Ang-(1-7) suppressed Ang II-induced pro-apoptotic activity, ROS overproduction, and NO reduction in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (Xiao et al., 2015). In another study, infusion with Ang (1–7) promoted brain angiogenesis, enhanced cerebral blood flow, and reduced infarct volume and neurological deficits after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats (Jiang et al., 2014). However, the results of these in vitro studies should be taken with caution and tested in clinical studies to prove their safety and effectiveness.",
            "Another interesting therapeutical approach is directly increasing the soluble form of ACE2 (sACE2), which promotes the expression of Ang-(1-7). There seems to be a correlation between sACE2 and the probability of recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection (El-Shennawy et al., 2022); it has been demonstrated that the transfection of exosomes of endothelial progenitor cells with lentivirus containing human ACE2 cDNA (ACE2-EPC-EXs) has a protective effect on hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced injury in cultured aging brain endothelial cells. Also, it was observed in a mouse DOCA-salt hypertension model that the overexpression of ACE2 in the brain “reduces oxidative stress and COX-mediated neuroinflammation, improves anti-oxidant and nitric oxide signaling, and thereby attenuates the development of neurogenic hypertension” (Sriramula et al., 2015).",
            "Concerning the delivery mechanism, in recent years, there has been an increased interest in using nanoparticles or nanomaterials to deliver drugs in a more controlled way (Zhou et al., 2021). The use of nanoparticles is complex but has numerous advantages over the traditional methods, including but not limited to high stability, incorporation of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances alike, variable routes of administration (Patil et al., 2020), and control of the local RAS at the brain, the capacity to travel across the BBB by different methods (depends on the nature of the nanoparticle) (Zhang et al., 2016; Song et al., 2021). Although some research groups have developed ACE2-enriched nanoparticles that “trap” the SARS-CoV-2, inhibiting the viral attachment to target cells (Cai et al., 2020; Mesias et al., 2021), nanoparticles can be used to deliver any drug or peptide that modifies the RAS in favor of the patient. Lastly, we believe there is a molecule type with untapped potential, not only as a therapeutic target but also as a treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 infection: the micro-ARNS (miRNAs). MiRNAs are small (averaging 22 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. They can recognize specific messenger RNAs and regulate their repression and degradation (O’Brien et al., 2018). Some miRNAs are upregulated in patients’ severe symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, and inhibiting these miRNAs could help the patient’s prognosis (Ying et al., 2021). Likewise, miRNAs targeting specific pro-inflammatory peptides (like cytokines and chemokines) could be used as a therapy to regulate the exacerbated inflammatory response presented in some patients (Naser et al., 2022). In theory, they could target any member of the RAS system with precision, depending on the needs of the patients. Moreover, miRNAs are small and stable enough to be used inside simple nanocarriers, like liposomes and micelles, with specific receptors or transporters to cross the BBB. This is fundamental if the objective is the local RAS in the brain or spinal cord (Poustforoosh et al., 2022).",
            "Inhibition of the RAS pathway has brought to light the concern that ACE inhibition could increase ACE2 as observed in animal models, enhancing SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could lead to a form of the most severe disease. However, these findings have not been confirmed in humans. However, the serum increase in ACE2 could be beneficial since the virus could bind to this soluble ACE2, and its entry into host cells could be inhibited, thus avoiding its replication and dissemination. In addition, an increase in ACE2 could favor the processing of Ang II to other cytoprotective peptides. Hundreds of clinical studies have been conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of these inhibitors, primarily in patients with hypertension, diabetes, renal and cardiovascular disease. Recent meta-analyses conclude that both the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs are safe and do not increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, nor does it increase the severity of COVID-19 (need for intensive therapy, use of mechanical ventilation, and death) (Lee et al., 2022). However, more studies are needed to determine the tissue-specific effect of RAS inhibitors, moreover, the use of micro-RNA needs deep investigations since important molecules of the RAS present single nucleotide variants (SNVs), which could modify the intervention by microRNAs. The use of RAS inhibitors, although it seems to be safe, should be taken with reservation because RAS modifications could enhance changes in other signaling pathways such as the kallikrei-bradykinin system, causing probable adverse effects (Schieffer and Schieffer, 2022).",
            "SARS-CoV-2 was initially identified as a respiratory virus, although it is now known to affect the whole body, even the nervous system. COVID-19-associated neurological symptoms include loss of taste and smell, headaches, stroke, delirium, and brain inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect the CNS; however, the neurological effects may be caused by immune activation, neuroinflammation, and damage to brain blood vessels, which could probably be a consequence of the dysregulation of both local and brain RAS, as a result of the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2.",
            "The disruption of ACE2 and the consequent accumulation of Ang II and other peptides (kinetensin, parental apelins, des−Arg9−bradykinin, and neurotensin), and the overactivation of AT1R, could lead to vasoconstriction dysregulation in blood pressure, pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant states conducing to brain damage. Therefore, the brain ACE2 expression levels and the pattern of this expression might be important for the individual risk, potential symptoms, and treatment outcomes of the neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "In addition, important sex-related differences in the neurological COVID-19-associated symptoms have been reported. In that sense, women seem to be more prone to develop physical, cognitive, neurological, and neuropsychiatric symptoms compared to males. This phenomenon could be closely related to the RAS profile disparities between males and females. However, this is an open field to explore in more depth.",
            "As discussed in this review, controlling the balance of systemic and brain RAS is promising to prevent or treat short and long-term neurological COVID-19-associated symptoms (Figure 3). However, the safety and benefits of using RAS inhibitors are still under debate, so more studies are needed and their use should be treated with caution.",
            "RAS-mediated therapeutic approaches against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The therapeutic approaches involve using ARBs (Angiotensin II receptor blockers) to inhibit the binding of Ang II to AT1R (red lines) or virus entry blocking by using the ACE2 soluble form or embedded in nanoparticles.",

            "Phylogenetically, the chemical sense of smell is the oldest of all sensory modalities in terrestrial and aquatic organisms. For most non-human species in the wild, it is essential like other senses for survival because it aids nutrition, detection of environmental threats, and mating. In contrast to other senses, olfaction holds some unique properties: vertebrates, humans, and other mammals can distinguish many thousands of different odors due to genetically determined specific odorant receptors which have a lifespan of about 1 month and then are continuously replaced by neuroneogenesis in the olfactory epithelium. From a historical perspective, fragrances and perfumes played a significant role in the most influential ancient cultures, Egypt, Greece, and China. Most important was the belief in the magic power of fragrances—which were classified as “pleasant” or “unpleasant”—for medical treatment, religious or funeral rituals, e.g., preparing the bodies of the deceased for the assumed life after death, purification and divine favor. Further perfumes were used to cover natural body odor, for personal grooming, or to offer a potential hedonic odor in sexual selection. In contemporary medicine, the potential diagnostic value of olfactory loss as a biological marker for an impending neurodegenerative disorder such as Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, or estimating the inflammatory activity in Multiple Sclerosis is increasingly recognized. The regeneration of odorant receptors and inhibitory interneurons provide the basis for long-term recovery of loss of olfaction due to respiratory infections, for example in pandemics like COVID-19 or after a head trauma. Imaging disorders of olfaction disclosed clinically relevant structural changes of the brain network of olfaction and the intimate reciprocal interaction with other networks to subserve higher cortical functions such as an impressive specific odor memory, quality of life, emotion, cognition, selection of food, social interaction, stress, and depression. The latter higher olfactory functions often remain undetected by both patients and their doctors. A more intensive implementation of olfactory function and clinical testing should be considered in medical training.",
            "From an evolutionary perspective, smell is the oldest sense, as experimentally shown by Nijland and Burgess (2010) who found a behavioral response to odorant molecules sensed by airborne volatile metabolites in Bacillus licheniformis. However, one should distinguish between so-called micro-and macrosomatic species. Bacteria, single-celled microorganisms, belong to the group of prokaryotes without cognitive functions. In later phylogenesis, it is remarkable that the sense of smell comparatively shows little development and alterations. In most non-human species, olfaction is essential for survival for three major functions: (1) nutrition (foraging and testing edibility), (2) detection of serious threats that may go undetected by other senses (avoidance of environmental danger), (3) mating (finding the right partner for reproductive purposes).",
            "In humans and other mammals, the sense of smell, in contrast to other senses, holds unique structural and functional properties:",
            "Mammals and humans can distinguish many thousands of different odors, the majority of which cannot be identified by name, but others can be recognized for life after a few exposures in childhood, characteristic of a precise often emotionally linked smell memory.",
            "The ability to distinguish many thousands of odor qualities is based on similar specific odorant receptors, the molecular structure of which was first disclosed by the Nobel laureates Buck and Axel (1991). They discovered a large gene family, comprised of some 1,000 different genes, equivalent to the olfactory receptor types (Press Release, 2024).",
            "The huge number of different smell receptors stands in an unexplained contrast to the cooperative sense of taste with only six receptors for the flavors of sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami, and licorice (Brandt et al., 2024).",
            "The mean lifespan of olfactory receptor neurons is about 1 month with a replacement by mitotic generation from basal stem cells in the olfactory epithelium, an example of an adult neurogenesis over the entire lifespan in animals (Lledo and Valley, 2016) and humans (Glezer and Malnic, 2019; Franco et al., 2025). This recovery is beneficial for the frequent loss of olfactory function in infectious diseases such as COVID-19 (Li et al., 2024).",
            "A loss of olfactory function may be an early indicator of an impending neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson’s disease or Alzheimer’s disease (Marin et al., 2018).",
            "The central network of the olfactory system must be extensive to subserve higher cortical functions such as quality of and satisfaction with life, emotion, cognition, social interactions, dietary choices, stress, and depressive symptoms (Bratman et al., 2024).",
            "When other sensory systems, especially vision, are impaired, the sense of smell takes on a particularly important compensatory role. Odor thresholds and discrimination of dangerous decomposing food have been shown to be superior in blind subjects to those of controls (Çomoglu et al., 2015; Guducu et al., 2016; Kolarik and Moore, 2024).",
            "In the following review, we will focus on some aspects of the human sense of smell whose importance is often underestimated in today’s society, although well recognized in the animal world and easy to observe in the behavior of our pets. The review includes facets of phylogenetic evolution, antique sources on functions and applications of fragrance in various cultures, the development and usage of perfumes, and the neurology of smell disorders.",
            "Phylogenetic evolution refers to the development of biodiversity and how different organisms from bacteria, worms, and insects to vertebrates, mammals, and primates are related and have evolved from common ancestors over time. The research findings are extensive and involve molecular, genetical, biological, or clinical disciplines. Starting from a genetic radiation in reptiles 200 million years ago, terrestrial vertebrates can differentiate millions of odorants and in the mammalian genome the olfactory receptor gene family is the largest, comprising 1% of all genes (Hoover, 2010). Amniotes originated on land but some became aquatic and therefore had to adapt their sense of smell to underwater olfaction which created amphibious species with both capabilities, aquatic amniotes (Kishida, 2021). The separation of two main chemical senses, olfaction and gustation, remained largely preserved and independent of the aquatic habitat in which most ancestral and numerous vertebrates, fish, live (Derby and Caprio, 2024). With a view to neuroethological principles, the study of insect olfaction revealed how the ecological environment and other selective pressures forced the fascinating diversity of this large group of species (Hansson and Stensmyr, 2011). On the contrary, the general features of the olfactory system are remarkably consistent across vertebrates, e.g., with respect to the vomeronasal system (Eisthen, 1997). The nasal cavity, which serves olfaction and respiratory air-conditioning, shows a development with anatomical reduction of the vomeronasal system in both cetaceans and primates (Van Valkenburgh et al., 2014). A correlated transformation affected olfaction, mastication, head movements, and ventilation as derived from mammalian fossils and called ortho-retronasal olfaction (Rowe and Shepherd, 2016). As summarized by Ache and Young (2005), “There are striking similarities between species in the organization of the olfactory pathway, from the nature of the odorant receptor proteins, to perireceptor processes, to the organization of the olfactory CNS, through odor-guided behavior and memory.” Finally, the frequently heard opinion that humans have a poorer sense of smell than other mammals is contradicted by some scientists who even emphasize that humans can discriminate a similar range of odors and are more sensitive to some odors than rodents or dogs (Mc Gann, 2017).",
            "Ancient natural philosophy also included attempts to systematically name odors and their associated emotional components. Different positions (Wöhrle, 1987) have been taken: Plato (427–347 BC) mentions in ‘Timaeus’ that only “the pleasant” and “the unpleasant” odors can be individually distinguished without further specification. His concept was based on the assumption that the elements themselves are odorless and that smell arises from certain transformation processes that occur in the transition from water to air and from air to water as smoke or mist. Aristotle (384–322 BC) takes a somewhat different view, especially in his ‘De Anima’ and ‘De Sensu’. He writes that smelling takes place through a medium, air or water. The air inhaled through the nose and the pneuma that flows in from the heart via the brain vessels mix in the ‘poroi’, the canal-like pathways between the nose and the brain. In ‘De Sensu’ he writes that the olfactory organ is located in the brain (Jütte, 2000). He described the difficulty in determining the properties of odors because of the limited competence of the human sense of smell, which therefore only allows a rough emotional distinction. According to Aristotle, smell and taste seem to behave analogously, with the types of taste corresponding to those of smell. He assumed specific odors that can only be named accordingly if they are parallel to taste, such as a sweet, sharp, tart, pungent, oily, or sour odor. Both authors attribute the accompanying affects to the biological needs of humans. An odor is perceived as pleasant if it restores the natural state of the body or if it is beneficial to this state (Wöhrle, 1987; Jütte, 2000; Jütte, 2012). Theophrastus (371–287 BC), a student of Aristotle, notes that there are seven types of smell, although he does not specifically list these odors. He is more cautious about the terminology and emphasizes that one should not speak of a bitter, salty, oily, or sour odor. Galen (ca. 129–216 AD) also divided odors into those that smell good and those that smell bad, stating that unpleasant odors differ from each other not considerably. In contrast to Aristotle and Theophrastus, he excluded the tart smell (Wöhrle, 1987). In ‘De placitis Hippocraticis et Platonis’ Galen writes: “Incidentally, the organ of smell is not located in the nasal cavities, as most people assume, but in the outermost sections of the anterior ventricles of the brain, where the nasal passages extend. It is in this section that the ventricles contain the most air” (Jütte, 2000). This anatomical conception contributed to the fact that for centuries the physiological process of sensory perception via the nerve stimulus and the transmission of stimuli to perception in the brain was misjudged. The Arab scholar Avicenna alias Ibn Sinai (980–1037 AD) summarized Aristotelian and Galenic knowledge in his doctrine of the senses. He also explained the smelling process by inhaling air that has absorbed the odor from a smelling body. This air then comes into contact with the frontal part of the brain and is detected by the olfactory system. He raised the theory of perception to a new level and brought memory into play. In his work ‘Risala fi n-nafs’ (‘On the Soul’) he writes: “Perception is either external—the five senses—or internal—the common sense, imagination, judgement and memory” (Jütte, 2000). The memory serves to retain the thoughts or concepts with which one has sensually grasped the objects. The power of imagination restores what is blurred in the memory, the power of judgment distinguishes what the imagination considers to be correct or incorrect before it is transferred to the memory (Jütte, 2000). It was not until around 1500 AD that ‘fila olfactoria’ were recognized as olfactory nerves on the basis of cadaver studies (Jütte, 2012).",
            "In ancient Greece and Rome, reference is made to the importance of the sense of smell for susceptibility to and treatment of seasickness. In numerous descriptions of seasickness, two factors are repeatedly mentioned: first, the current status of the mental condition and stability; and second, the significance of pleasant or unpleasant odors (Huppert et al., 2016). The unfamiliar odor of the sea and inside the ship causes nausea and vomiting, in contrast to the familiar smell of drinkable river water. Plutarch mentions in ‘Aitiai Physikai’ (‘Questiones naturales’; ‘Natural phenomena’) (Plutarch, 1965) that unpleasant odors induce seasickness in susceptible persons. He writes: “Is it because, among the sensory perceptions, odour and, among the emotions, fear cause the most seasickness? But on the sea they feel aversion to the odour because of its unfamiliarity and are afraid because they distrust the present situation and the future.” ‘Sentina’, the ship’s slop or bilge water is also mentioned as a provoking factor. Caesar writes in ‘Bellum civile’ (Caesar (Caius Julius), 1914) that sentina, the dirty water in the bilge, a foul-smelling broth, the odor of which was constantly noticeable in the lightly built wooden antique ships, caused seasickness among the recruits. In addition, the bilge served as a lavatory in stormy weather and probably also collected the vomit of seasick persons who were not on deck. In ‘Circulio’ Plautus uses ‘sentina’ together with the term ‘nautea’ for indisposition and nausea, which makes an etiological connection between ‘nausea’ and ‘nautea’ likely (Plautus, 1963). Laena, an old drinker, sings the praises of wine: “For the scent of all ointments is nautea, compared to yours, you are myrrh to me, you cinnamon, you rose, you saffron and cassia, you most precious ointment, for where you are poured out, there I would like to be buried.” ‘Nautea’ becomes the cause of ‘nausea’ through the mediation of the sense of smell. The linguistic relationship between the two words proves the close connection between the sense of smell and the development of nausea and vomiting in the consciousness of the ancient world. Juvenal writes in ‘Satura’ about the sickening smell of bilge water (Juvenal, 1928): “… Then the wake (‘sentina’) is nauseating, then the firmament turns (‘tunc summus vertitur aer’).”",
            "Aromatic scents were also used to prevent and treat seasickness. Recommendations were to smell pleasant odors, such as thyme, mint or quince, then to inhale other pleasant scents, such as fennel, rose petals, boiled in wine or mint. Athenaios writes in ‘Deipnosophistae’ (Athenaios, 2012) how Aphrodite sent aromatic scents to seasick people on the ship after they had already given up hope of survival. Other recommendations are to drink wormwood, fast during the sea voyage, or impose a certain diet such as dried or cooked lentils with mint and bread, powdered in fragrant wine. An example of this is the story of the merchant Herostrat and the statue of Aphrodite that he had bought in Cyprus and wanted to take home with him. “When suddenly a storm broke over him as he was approaching Egypt, and it was impossible to tell where in the world they were, they all took refuge with the statue of Aphrodite and begged her to save them. The goddess now—since she was fond of the Naucratites—suddenly saw everything lying beside her, abundantly sprinkled with fresh myrtle, and filled the ship with the most pleasant fragrance, while the travelers had already given up hope of rescue because of the severe seasickness that prevailed and because of all the vomiting. And as the sun shone forth, they saw the anchorages and reached Naukratis.” The miracle that Aphrodite performs here can be seen as a causal therapy using the scent of myrtle. Aemilius Macer in ‘De viribus herbarum’ (Macer, Aemilius (pseudonym), 1932) reports about four remedies for ‘nausea’ (used here synonymously with seasickness), the satureis shrub (‘satureia’), dill (‘anethum’), fennel (‘feniculum’), pennyroyal (‘pulegium’). These plants are particularly strongly scented species, some of which contain essential oils. So in antiquity, therapy and prophylaxis with fragrances appeared to be useful. Further examples are found in Plinius ‘Historiae Naturales’ (Plinius (The Elder), 1951), where he recommends various strongly scented plants such as mallow (‘malva’), rose leaves boiled in wine, and pole mint (‘puleium’) as a therapy against ‘nausea’ (not clearly labelled here as seasickness). Oreibasios in ‘Synopsis ad Eustathium’ (Oreibasios, 1926) also gives therapeutic recommendations against vomiting during sea voyages using various foods by fragrant substances: “… or polei and water with very fine barley flour or small, fragrant wine with water and also very fine flour. But to counteract the unpleasant odours in the ships, you have to smell either quinces from Kedonya or thyme or polei.” So, the dietary suggestions all contain fragrant substances, presumably because the unpleasant odor on board was thought to be partly responsible for the occurrence of seasickness.",
            "Wormwood and mint, which were rubbed into olive oil and fragrant wine vinegar, were also to be applied to the nostrils repeatedly. This was intended to mask the unpleasant odors, especially the unfamiliar smell of salt water and the ‘sentina’. Seneca in ‘Ad Lucilium epistoles’ (Seneca Minor (Seneca the Younger), 1979) anoints himself with fragrant oil to refresh himself: “… As soon as I was in order with my stomach, which, as you know, does not get rid of seasickness as soon as I leave the sea, and had refreshed my body with anointing oil, I began to think about it …”",
            "The general differentiation of odor into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ is a characteristic of many cultures. This was also the case in ancient Egypt. The hieroglyphic script in various written sources (including papyrus scrolls, wall inscriptions, engravings in stone) shows the signs of fish and birds as prototypes of odor in ancient Egypt, and these were signs of a collective olfactory value. There are no references to individual olfactory perceptions in the ancient sources. Fish and birds lived in the natural environment in Egypt, the swamps of the Nile delta in the north of Egypt, and this stank. On the other hand, the city of Theben is described as clean and home to families. It is associated with myrrh, has the odor of perfume and the inhabitants are dressed in fresh garments. The ancient Egyptians believed in two concepts: ma’at und isfet. Ma’at is the world of order and justice, isfet that of chaos and evil. The king embodied ma’at, while the world’s natural state is that of isfet, a state of chaos, evil, lies, injustice and stench. The world smelled naturally bad, isfet smelled like fish and birds. The king’s task was to banish the stench of fish and birds and to establish ma’at. Then the people could go back to their cities, to the sweet odors, as written sources describe. Thus, sweet odors were synonymous with the result of the king’s efforts for society, allowing people to live in peace surrounded by good smells (Goldsmith, 2019). Egyptians also used scents in temples to honor various deities and perform mummification of the Pharaohs. Common fragrance ingredients were incense and myrrh. Ingredients were mainly imported from abroad and were expensive, which is why the best fragrances were allowed to use only the rich up to the king (Goldsmith, 2019). Pictorial grave decorations show scenes in which women smell fragrant bottles or flowers (Figure 1).",

            "The fact that odors have been connoted with geographic areas referring to ma’a’ or isfet could be explained how odor- and context-dependent memory seem to work in the brain. Olfactory memory is one of the strongest types of memory. Olfactory information is processed quickly and is retained longer as compared to other memories. Experiments showed that olfactory memory does not or very slowly declines over time—it is largely the same after 5 min and a year later (Engen, 1982). When olfactory memory is combined with contextual memory (Herz and Engen, 1996) or cross-modal paired-association it is strong and effective (Hamzeloo et al., 2025).",
            "From antiquity to the present day, perfumes have been used in most cultures to cover individual body odor or to provide a positive, attractive and interesting impact, or a smell that characterizes a certain social group (Capparuccini et al., 2010). In the 17th century, a guild of glove makers and perfumers was founded in France (Figure 2).",
            "An engraving by Nicolas de Larmessin (1638–1694), a French engraver, depicting a parfumeur in his typical costume.",
            "The potential hedonic role of olfaction in sexual selection was investigated in a contemporary behavioral study which revealed that non-pheromonal olfactory cues were involved in mate choice with strong hedonic responses that could dominate visual aspects in a cross-modal interaction (Capparuccini et al., 2010). Essential oils, a mixture of natural aromatic volatile oils extracted from plants, were widespread in Egyptian, Greek, Persian, and Chinese cultures and are still common today as complimentary remedies in medicines, aroma and massage therapies and food products (Sattayakhom et al., 2023). Today’s eau de toilette and perfume articles sometimes refer to the ancient roots by naming their products “Egyptian rose” (botanical name: Scabiosa atropurpurae) or “Etruscan water” for perfumes emphasizing a spicy-woody smell. In a review, Sattayakhom et al. (2023) included 70 studies and concluded that essential oils showed beneficial effects including antistress, antianxiety, analgesic, cognitive, and autonomic effects, which led them to recommend it as an alternative therapy. In traditional Chinese medicine, inhalation in the forms of smoke, steam vapor, medicated pillows and aromatic sachets have been widely used for treatment of respiratory diseases since antiquity but only a few aromatic inhalation products have been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (Miao et al., 2015). The fragrant camphor tree (botanical name: Cinnamomum camphora) was used as a fumigant in the era of Black Death (Chen et al., 2013), a pandemic outbreak throughout Europe and Asia that killed half of the population. Camphor has been used in cosmetics, in household cleaners, and as food flavoring with biological properties such as insecticidal, antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticoccidial effects; however, it is quite toxic a substance which significantly limits its use (Chen et al., 2013). Before we focus on the use of fragrances and perfumes as medical substances, some still used in the present day, we will first compile historical sources from different ancient cultures.",
            "Good odors played a major role in ancient Egyptian society. Egypt was famous for its perfume among other ancient civilizations. Perfume was mainly produced in Alexandria, which was also a famous marketplace for several Egyptian products such as myrrh. Mendes, the ancient Egyptian city of Djedet (today Arabic تل الربع Tall al-Rubˁ) in the eastern Nile Delta, was also famous for its perfume. The manufacture of perfumes is depicted in several ancient Egyptian temples. Perfume recipes are inscribed on the walls of the laboratories of the Ptolemaic temples. The manufacturing process of the fragrances consisted of three techniques. The substances were powdered, mixed together and then heated over a fire, several herbs and plants such as iris were used to make perfume. Iris root or balsam was the base for perfumes; the most fragrant oils in ancient Egypt were myrrh, frankincense and lily, which were mixed with other essentials from flowers, fruits and herbs (Fadel, 2020). Various words were used that referred to perfume such as “ndm.st” for pleasant and “rdw” for the jar containing the substance (Fadel, 2020). Different types of perfume, stored in elaborate vessels, as well as fragrant flowers were offered to the deities, which is depicted in the art of ancient Egypt (Byl, 2012). Perfume bottles in the shape of a monkey have survived from the new Kingdom (Figure 3 left).",

            "Large quantities of incense, perfume, and scented flowers were used in the temples to please the deities (Fadel, 2020). The temple ritual of the cult statue was a central element of this and was performed every morning on the principal cult statue in every Egyptian temple, by anointing the cult statues with precious oils and unguents. Especially in the temples of the Ptolemaic period, illustrations show how perfume as well as cloth were offered to various deities. The blue lotus flower was considered the perfume of the sweat of the good Ra. In the temple of Hathor at Dendera, there is a scene in which the king offers the ‘horizon of lotus’ cloth to the goddess Isis which is said to be soaked in lotus scent (Fadel, 2020; Byl, 2012).",
            "Ointments and perfumes were widely used in antiquity either as part of everyday life and personal hygiene or on special occasions such as funeral rites or religious rituals in preparing the bodies of the deceased for the assumed life after death, purification, and divine favor. They were first established in Mesopotamia, further developed in Egypt, and then spread to Greece and the rest of the Mediterranean area. The people of antiquity believed that good odors were associated with deities and had a positive effect on health and well-being, as well as having a positive effect on social contacts. The quality of the perfume and its use frequently described a certain social status. Many ancient Greek and Roman writers such as Theophrastus, Plinius, Hippocrates, or Aristotle provided some details about the ancient odors (Voudouri and Tesseromatis, 2015). A connection between divine power and odor can be found in the earliest literature. Good-smelling substances such as myrrh, cassia, and saffron were already mentioned in the Iliad (around 700 BC). Frankincense became established in rituals at the end of the archaic period. Incense was probably brought westwards via Cyprus and burnt in the temple of Aphrodite, for example (Potter, 1999). The association of odor with divine power in the Hellenic world is also found in other states in the rest of the Mediterranean area and the Middle East. However, the choice of specific odors and substances for characteristic sacred acts differed among cultures.",
            "In the Roman world, attitudes toward aromatic scents were very ambivalent. Pliny, for example, had little good to say about them, writing that perfumes were the most superfluous form of luxury and that the early Romans managed without these substances. He describes, for example, how the ruler Caligula sprinkled the walls of his bathhouses or bathtubs with scents. Perfume was considered a luxury, representing moral decay, and even associated with state problems. However, these views on the use of perfume in Rome had no significant influence in real life. Evidence that men used perfume, which was considered feminine, is found in the social elite at that time (Potter, 1999).",
            "The ancient civilization of the Etruscans in Italy between the 9th and 1st centuries BC, i.e., before the Roman Empire, had a tradition of personal grooming and religious rituals, in which perfumes also played an important role (Barker and Rasmussen, 2000; MacIntosh Turfa, 2013). This is reflected by iconographic representations on ceramics and frescoes. Perfume vessels (Figure 3 right), especially alabastrons, aryballoi, and amphorae were either imported from the Eastern Mediterranean or later locally produced to store scented oils and perfumes from the natural ingredients, myrrh, saffron, or resin. Etruscans, obviously inspired by Greek customs, used private perfume vessels as a status symbol of an elite social life, which held their unguents and perfumes. Favorite vessels were inspired by nature and took the form of birds, such as cocks and ducks. These vessels, found in tombs, indicate that the Etruscans were as fond of the luxury of unguents and perfumes as were the Romans in later times (Norton, 1881).",
            "Despite all this use of good odors, there is no doubt that the urban air of the Roman Empire stank from the burning of meat and other food smells, waste, and dead bodies. This was also the case in the Middle Ages—medieval cities stank and foul odors were associated with diseases such as the plague (Jørgensen, 2013). In the Middle Ages, herbs, and certainly fragrant or essential herbs, were used as remedies, and most monasteries developed herb gardens to produce these herbal remedies. The success of these remedies was attributed to their effect on the humors—medieval medicine was based on the theory of humoral pathology. It was said that each person has four humors to which fluids, the black bile, yellow bile, phlegm and blood, were assigned. The balance was decisive for a person’s health; an imbalance of bodily fluids leads to illness. Hildegard von Bingen (1098–1179) a wise abbess, learnt this doctrine developed by Hippocrates; for her, illnesses were embedded in a cosmic context, God and the devil played a role, and demons also brought plagues and death. She wrote texts on natural history and medicine, which we know today from two works, ‘Physika’ (natural history) and ‘Causa et cura’ (medicine). In these works, she discusses the potential benefits of each ailment or herbal remedy, assigning their healing effects to different organs (Bizzarri, 2018). Herbal books from the Middle Ages contain long lists of indications for each plant, most of which are no longer approved today and often even lack the current indication. In this respect, these traditional indications should be used with caution (Uehleke et al., 2012). Fragrancies have been used as a medicine for patients with dementia and behavioral problems, for example, but it has been shown that this therapy cannot change the behavior of patients with dementia (Gray and Clair, 2002). Another application of fragrancies is described for migraines. Here, the use of aromatic oils such as lavender oil, peppermint oil, or rose oil was tested. These oils were said to work through mechanisms that act on vasodilation, inhibition of neurogenic inflammation, and reduction of central pain sensitization, interpreted as a possible non-invasive alternative treatment that can be used additively (Abo-Elghiet et al., 2025).",
            "Olfactory dysfunctions are certainly among the most clinically overlooked sensory symptoms, although impairment of the sense of smell leads to a reduced quality of life. There are two reasons why they may be undetected in the clinical examination: on the one hand, slowly developing minor disturbances may not be noticed by the patients; on the other hand, clinicians often judge the function based on the patient’s self-assessment rather than applying a time-consuming smell test. The most commonly used tests in clinical and scientific studies are (Devere, 2012) the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and the Sniffin’ Sticks Test (SST) or its shorter version SST-12 for screening purposes (Schepens et al., 2024).",
            "In case of a pronounced reduction of odor function, the main complaints are impaired ability to perceive and recognize smoke or spoiled foods, distinguish pleasant scents including pheromones, and overcome taste disorders associated with decreased appetite. This can lead to unexplained weight loss and depression (Devere, 2012). Current tests of the sense of smell such as that established by Henkin therefore include detection, recognition, thresholds, magnitude estimation, and hedonic ratings as parameters (Hernandez et al., 2024). A so-called microbiome-gut-brain axis has been described in animals for regulation of the hippocampal serotonergic system for maintenance of homeostasis (Clarke et al., 2013). This “gut-brain axis” seems to control dietary decisions by collaboration of homeostatic and hedonic processes including multisensory input of smell, taste, and sight for regulation of appetite, satiety, and eating behavior (Clarke et al., 2024). Olfaction plays a key role in food appreciation and selection as well as in obesity with brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and substrate utilization (López et al., 2023).",
            "Since the many terms used to describe olfactory dysfunctions such as hyposmia (reduced sense of smell), anosmia (loss of smell), hyperosmia (heightened sense of smell), dysosmia (altered sense of smell) or parosmia and phantosmia are currently not uniformly defined. A group of experts (Hernandez et al., 2023) proposed a standardization of the various terms used in clinical and scientific settings. Parosmia, for example, is an often unpleasant distorted quality of smell due to a mismatch between the memory and the actual experience elicited by a specific odor stimulus (Xu et al., 2025), possibly caused by an inadequate regeneration of olfactory neuronal processing. Phantosmia means a hallucination as sensory perception without an odor stimulus as the trigger.",

            "A long-term follow-up study by London et al. (2008) revealed that about 50% of the patients with an initial total smell loss after a head trauma exhibited mild to moderate or complete improvement. Regeneration is based on the continuous replacement of damaged odorant receptors from stem cells in the epithelium’s basal region (Glezer and Malnic, 2019). This process is complex and probably also involves the activity of local inhibitory interneurons (Lledo and Valley, 2016). In central lesions, gene expression profiles of neuroblasts’ migration in the peri-injured cortex have been found (Miyamoto et al., 2025).",
            "Olfactory dysfunctions have been described as a marker of the inflammatory activity and progression in MS (Bsteh et al., 2019); a meta-analysis of a total of 1,099 MS cases found a pooled prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in 27.2% (Mirmosayyeb et al., 2022).",
            "Olfactory dysfunction is a clinical marker for early stages, disease progression, and cognitive decline in neurodegenerative disorders (Marin et al., 2018); in mild cognitive impairment it can predict Alzheimer’s disease at follow up (Devanand et al., 2000) and Parkinson’s disease (Jankovic, 2008; Alonso et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2023). In Parkinson’s disease multiple sensory disturbances of vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch occur which affect the patient’s quality of life beyond the motor disorder (Ma et al., 2023).",
            "More than 4,000 patients suffering from COVID-19 who were assessed by an international questionnaire self-reported the quantity and quality of three distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and chemesthesis); the results showed that the impairment was not limited to smell but also affected taste and chemesthesis (Parma et al., 2020). Chemesthesis is not a sensory system on its own but reflects an inadequate stimulation of preferably trigeminal sensors such as the coolness of menthol in mouthwashes or the burning sensation watering eyes when cutting onions; the diagnostic accuracy of screening Sniffin’ Sticks Tests (SST-12) is slightly lower as compared to the validated longer version (Schepens et al., 2024). The pathogenesis of COVID-19 anosmia may be caused by inflammation of the olfactory clefts and damage to the epithelium or the central nervous network (Meng and Pan, 2024). Post-acute central and peripheral sequela of the infection are complex and still not fully understood (Saxena and Mautner, 2024). The presence of parosmia seems to predict persistent quantitative olfactory dysfunction often for years (Gary et al., 2023).",
            "Anosmia can sometimes be a key symptom of a congenital condition. The prototypical example of this is the rare Kallmann syndrome, a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by the combination of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with delayed puberty and diminished or absent sense of smell (Fechner et al., 2008; Stamou and Georgopoulos, 2018; Yadav et al., 2025). Congenital ciliopathies can also present with various clinical features and anosmia (Green and Mykytyn, 2010). Brain structural characteristics in congenital and acquired anosmia are altered differently (Manan et al., 2022).",
            "Olfactory training may be an effective and affordable option in the treatment of olfactory dysfunction in patients with head trauma or infections of the respiratory tract but requires adherence to the prescribed training regimen (Li et al., 2024). However, olfactory training should not be seen as a universal therapy for anosmia, given the variability of results (Moura et al., 2025).",
            "Our sense of smell not only distinguishes countless pleasant and unpleasant fragrance qualities by comparing them with the memory of previous smells, but also simultaneously influences quality of life, emotions, cognition, social interactions, dietary choices, stress, anxiety, and depression (Bratman et al., 2024). An appetizing smell triggers saliva secretion, a foul unpleasant odor, on the other hand, triggers nausea and vomiting. These different odor-dependent behaviors require an extensive central network of olfaction with structural and functional reciprocal interconnections between all sensory systems, memory, the limbic system, attention, and spatial orientation to name just a few. The olfactory-auditory sensory convergence in the basal forebrain of mice may serve as an example. In vivo electrophysiological recordings from the olfactory tubercle revealed single units which responded to odors and auditory tones with cross-modal modulation (Wesson and Wilson, 2010). This multimodal convergence allows assignment and identification of two different sensory inputs from a related source at an early stage of odor processing (Wesson and Wilson, 2010), e.g., anticipating the actions of others and, thereby shaping social interactions (Aglioti and Pazzaglia, 2011).",
            "The central network of olfaction is diverse and complex due to its intimate integration in various higher cortical functions. The olfactory bulb projects via the lateral olfactory tract to the anterior olfactory nucleus, the olfactory tubercle, amygdala, piriform and entorhinal cortex. The anterior commissure connects the bilateral anterior olfactory nuclei; the piriform cortex is involved in the categorization of odors and has projections to the thalamic complex, hippocampus, amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex which is supposed to consciously perceive the particular odor. Emotional and autonomic responses are assigned to connections between the entorhinal cortex and the amygdala; the hippocampal complex and the limbic system are involved in the remarkable long-term-memories and associated emotions. Olfaction is still the least understood sensory modality and its central organization in networks is less precise than that of other sensory systems (Figure 4) (Purves et al., 2001). Since the olfactory networks consist of peripheral sinonasal and central neuronal pathways CT scans are paramount for detecting peripheral bony causes while MRI allows for a detailed assessment of the soft tissue of both the peripheral and central components of the olfactory structures and thus enables the detection and localization of the pathological causes (Lie et al., 2021).",

            "Numerous imaging studies using EEG, MRT, or single-neuron representations of odors have disclosed these anatomic and functional task-dependent olfactory functions and disorders of smell (Olofsson and Freiherr, 2019). Intracranial EEG has been used to investigate context-dependent timing and sequence of neuronal oscillations in different structures of the olfactory system (Mignot et al., 2024). Using a similar Intracranial EEG technique, volitional respiratory maneuvers such as active sniffing and apnea were compared (Granget et al., 2025). Preparation of sniff maneuvers and short apnea involved low-frequency bands in the posterior insula and temporal regions extending to amygdala. In MRI studies, functional connectivity showed that sensory cortices converge to central hubs in the association cortices, e.g., the default-mode network. Menelaou et al. (2024) found evidence for two distinct pathways: one from the anterior olfactory nucleus and olfactory tubercle to the orbitofrontal cortex for processing reward, the other from the piriform cortex involving the anterior insula, intermediate frontal sulcus, and parietal operculum. In another fMRI study, lemon fragrance inhalation caused higher levels of alertness in healthy participants which was associated with increased global functional connectivity in the thalamus but decreased activity in other regions (Martial et al., 2023). Graph theory analysis revealed an increased network integration of olfaction and emotion. With fMRI it was also possible to visualize prediction errors of listening to spoken words which were not matched by the expected odor, a paradigm which is mediated by the anterior cingulate cortex (Pierzchajlo et al., 2024). Another fMRI study addressed the question of the differential neuronal basis of lower-and higher-order olfactory functions such as passive smelling, odor encoding, and in particular odor recognition memory (Eek et al., 2023). Successful recognition of familiar odors was associated with neural suppression of regions including the anterior insula, posterior cingulate gyrus, dentate and middle frontal gyrus, amygdala, and piriform cortex; the hippocampus and posterior cingulate were involved in a postrecognition process. Odors also affect the working memory by an inverse correlation between regions associated with olfaction and working memory (Heidari et al., 2024). The latter finding may be relevant with respect to animal experimental behavioral studies which showed that exposure to chemosignals produced by stressed mice were sufficient to impair memory retrieval in unstressed male mice (Gómez-Sotres et al., 2024). This was interpretated as bulb astrocytes providing a link between social odors and the corresponding behavioral performance. New methods allow recordings of single-neuron activity in the piriform cortex and temporal lobe in awake humans performing odor rating and identification tasks (Kehl et al., 2024). This disclosed that piriform neurons preferably encode chemical odor identity and hippocampal activity reflects odor perception, supporting a multimodal role of the human piriform cortex.",
            "Imaging will play a more relevant clinical role in diagnostics of disorders of smell in the future. Although patients with idiopathic olfactory dysfunction in a systematic review uncommonly exhibited MRI structural pathologies such as olfactory meningiomas or neuroblastomas, patients with mixed etiologies showed reduced olfactory bulb and gray matter volumes (Hura et al., 2022). A comparison of olfactory-related brain tissue changes in patients with congenital versus acquired anosmia revealed that acquired olfactory loss led to reduced volumes and thickness of the gyrus rectus, medial orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum (Manan et al., 2022). Congenital anosmia, however, showed larger volumes and higher thickness in parts of the olfactory network. Temporal lobe epilepsy involves structures of the primary and secondary olfactory cortex such as the piriform and entorhinal cortex, the amygdala and the hippocampus. Accordingly, this condition is characterized by an increased olfactory dysfunction of secondary olfactory structures connected to the limbic system (Schmidt et al., 2024). In patients with paroxysmia, resting state MRI scans exhibited a reduced information flow between memory decision centers, and primary and secondary olfactory areas (Thaploo et al., 2023). In de novo Parkinson’s disease, diffusion MRIs at the baseline visit compared with a 48-month follow-up visit revealed structural connectivity changes associated with apathy in patients with dysfunction of smell (Martinez-Nunez et al., 2022). A resting-state fMRI study describes different olfactory network alterations in patients with Parkinson’s disease and mild cognitive impairment (Cieri et al., 2024). On the other hand, in early blind humans increased odor processing performance was found which was associated a significantly higher olfactory bulb volume (Rombaux et al., 2010) and which was associated with an activation of the occipital cortex during odor processing tasks in functional MRI (Renier et al., 2013).",
            "One goal of the selective discourse on the mysterious sense of olfaction was to show that fragrances and perfumes were more significant in the authoritative ancient cultures than in today’s society. In antiquity, the Egyptians, Greeks, Etruscans, Chinese, and Persians believed in the magic power of odors for personal grooming, medical treatment and religious or funeral rituals such as perfuming their dead for the assumed life after death to make the gods friendly. In today’s world smell seems to play a more subordinate role compared to other sensory modalities, although molecular, systemic, and behavioral studies clearly prove how our quality of life, the state of mind, and social interactions still depend on sometimes not consciously perceived memories of smells shaping our behavior. In medicine, the diagnostic importance of olfactory disorders is increasingly recognized as a biological marker. However, the implementation in medical training is very hesitant. The latter statement is hard to believe, but it is supported by clinical studies. An international, cross-sectional survey of current practice in the assessment of olfaction from 18 countries revealed the lowest rates from Japan (1.4%) and the highest from Greece (72.5%). Most UK clinicians do not perform psychophysical smell testing during any of the presented clinical scenarios. Reasons for this clinical deficit were related to service provision such as time and funding limitations (Whitcroft et al., 2024a). There is little standardization of clinical practice and many professionals across specialties were dismissive toward olfactory dysfunction and lacked appropriate knowledge of both its pathophysiology and effects (Whitcroft et al., 2024b). Some of the most important experimental studies in the future will include those of the mechanisms of olfactory receptors in neural regeneration, not only for restoration of smell, but also as a model for central nervous system neuroneogenesis (Franco et al., 2025). In this way, olfactory receptors could serve as potential therapeutic targets to accelerate neuronal repair processes and functional recovery in central nervous system injuries, brain and spinal cord. Another important topic for future research on the olfactory system is the combination of electrophysiological and new imaging techniques such as connectivity studies to elucidate the intimate interaction of the widely distributed central olfactory network with cognition, memory, and emotions. This also involves investigating the dependence of higher order olfactory cognitive functions and the triggering or amplification of depressive disorders (Yuan and Slotnick, 2014).",

            "The outbreak of the novel and highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in hundreds of millions of infections and millions of deaths globally. Infected individuals that progress to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) experience upper and lower respiratory complications that range in severity and may lead to wide-spread inflammation and generalized hypoxia or hypoxemia that impacts multiple organ systems, including the central and peripheral nervous systems. Since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, multiple reports continue to emerge that detail neurological symptoms, ranging from relatively mild (e.g., impaired taste and/or smell) to severe (e.g., stroke), suggesting SARS-CoV-2 may be neurotropic and/or contribute to nervous system injury through direct and/or indirect mechanisms. To gain insight into the types of neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their possible relationship with age, sex, COVID-19 severity, and comorbidities, we performed a systematic review of case reports and series published in 2020 – April 4, 2021 of infected patients with neurological manifestations. Meta-analyses were conducted using individual patient data from reports where these data could be extracted. Here, we report neurological injury occurs across the lifespan in the context of infection, with and without known comorbidities, and with all disease severities, including asymptomatic patients. Older individuals, however, are more susceptible to developing life-threatening COVID-19 and cerebrovascular disease (CVD), such as stroke. A mild but inverse correlation with age was seen with CNS inflammatory diseases, such as encephalitis, as well as taste and/or smell disorders. When reported, increased age was also associated with comorbid cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lipid disorders, but not with obesity. Obesity did correlate with development of critical COVID-19. Discussion into potential pathophysiological mechanisms by which neurological symptoms arise and long-term consequences of infection to the nervous system is also provided.",
            "Infectious disease, ranging in severity from symptoms of a mild cold to severe acute respiratory distress are attributed to coronaviruses (CoV)s. The majority of this large family of viruses are transmitted among non-human species, however, occasional zoonosis has resulted in seven known CoV strains that infect and cause disease in humans. Of these, three human CoVs (huCoVs) strains have emerged over the past two decades that can promote severe disease and even death. Severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, emerged in 2003 and 2012, respectively, causing significant global illness and mortality (Drosten et al., 2003; Memish et al., 2013). In December 2019, a novel CoV strain, now designated SARS-CoV-2, was first reported to infected humans and cause severe disease, termed CoV disease-19 (COVID-19). While most individuals with COVID-19 experience mild to moderate symptoms, others develop more severe disease, leading to death in a subset of these patients. Rapid transmission of the virus has resulted in a global pandemic resulting in hundreds of millions of infections and millions of deaths, worldwide, that remains on-going at the time of this review (Huang et al., 2020; WHO, 2021).",
            "Although primarily considered a virus impacting the respiratory system, an increasing number of case studies have highlighted substantial neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) lists new confusion or the inability to arouse as indicators of severe COVID-19 presentation, necessitating emergency medical attention (CDC, 2020). Early reports from Wuhan, China alerted the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, as multiple patients developed headache and dizziness, anosmia, and/or ageusia, which were often reported as initial symptoms of infection and disease (Chen N. et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). In addition, acute onset of more serious neurological symptoms, including altered mental status (encephalopathy), meningoencephalitis, demyelinating diseases, and stroke are increasingly reported in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (Al-Olama et al., 2020; Farhadian et al., 2020; Lodigiani et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Scullen et al., 2020; TunÇ et al., 2020). Many reports that reveal the age of the subjects studied suggest that patients older than 50 years are more likely to experience severe neurological complications, however, varying new onset neurological manifestations have also been reported among younger individuals and appear to be a common complication of COVID-19. As such, there is a critical need for investigating the impact of COVID-19 on the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we present evidence for a direct or indirect role of SARS-CoV-2 in promoting neurological disease in individuals across the lifespan via a systematic review of the literature and meta-analyses. We also discuss potential pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2-associated CNS injury and the potential for long-term neurological complications of infection in recovered patients, including the potential impact of disease on pathological brain aging.",
            "A systematic review was conducted for the purposes of identifying the population of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with new onset neurological condition(s) during the disease course. This review was designed and organized in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al., 2009). The database PubMed-NCBI was systematically searched for peer-reviewed literature presenting original clinical data of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with a neurological condition. The search of PubMed-NCBI alone is considered comprehensive and reliable, as over 90% of MEDLINE is covered by this database, thus the search of additional databases was deemed unnecessary (Williamson and Minter, 2019). Manuscripts published from 2019 to April 4, 2021 were interrogated using the following search terms: (“COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2”) AND (“Brain” OR “Neuro” OR “Stroke” OR “Seizure” OR “Anosmia” OR “Ageusia” OR “Guillain-Barré” OR “Headache” OR “Dizziness” OR “Confusion” OR “Impaired Consciousness” OR “Seizure” OR “Encephalopathy” OR “Meningitis”) NOT “review.” The search was restricted to full text peer-reviewed reports available in English containing original clinical data. Preprint articles were not included. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the type and incidence of neurological complications of COVID-19 in relation to age. As such, only published articles with original clinical data containing the following criteria were included: (1) age of patient(s) featured in the study, (2) a diagnosis of new onset neurological manifestations, and (3) laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Exclusion criteria included: (1) any known pre-existing neurological conditions, (2) known co-current viral or parasitic infection, and/or (3) opinions, viewpoints, personal anecdotes, and reviews. Seizure was reported in a SARS-CoV-2 positive 6-week-old male (Dugue et al., 2020), however, this case was excluded from analysis because a history of seizure could not be ruled out, due to the young age. An 80-year-old woman with Alzheimer’s dementia, who developed stroke (Xiong et al., 2020) and a 52-year-old HIV-infected woman with posterior reversible encephalitic syndrome (PRES) (Anand et al., 2020a) were also excluded from analyses, as these comorbidities could not be ruled-out as significant confounders to the development of neurological disease in the context of COVID-19.",
            "Articles vetted for inclusion were independently reviewed by BNS and TF, and the following information was extracted for analysis: age, gender, neurological manifestation, COVID-19 symptom severity, comorbidities, and presence of virus in CSF or autopsied brain. All data were captured and maintained in a Microsoft Excel workbook. Any disagreement regarding inclusion was resolved by discussion.",
            "To reduce the effects of heterogeneity among the case reports, neurological diagnoses/symptoms were evaluated and categorized as cerebrovascular disease (CVD), peripheral neuropathy, encephalopathy, demyelinating disease, smell and/or taste disorder, and CNS inflammatory disease. The category “other” was included to capture patients who exhibited neurological symptoms, but the underlying cause was not determined or identified. This is expanded in Supplementary Table 1. Dichotomous outcomes were created for each category of CNS disease for statistical tests. Reported comorbidities were also reduced to dummy variables for assessing potential relationships with hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), lipid disorder, obesity, none, and other. This is expanded in Supplementary Table 2. For analyses, comorbidities were scaled based on their overall relationship with CVD, which had the strongest association with age and COVID-19 severity. Scores were designed as follows: None = 0, other = 1, obesity = 2, lipid disorder = 3, DM = 4, HTN = 5. This allowed for the inclusion of multiple reported comorbidities by synthesizing a “comorbidity score” for each patient equal to the sum of the individual scores. For example, a patient with HTN and DM would have a comorbidity score = 9. “None” includes only reports that specifically stated no comorbidities. Reports that did not include comorbidities were excluded from analyses that required these data. COVID-19 severity was converted to ordinal variables as follows: asymptomatic = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2, severe = 3, critical = 4.",
            "Statistical tests were performed using Prism 9 for MacOS (v9.1.1) and the on-line statistics software, Intellectus Statistics (2021)1. Graphs were constructed with Prism and Microsoft Excel. Summary statistics for individual patient data were calculated for each variable. A general assessment of the relationship between age and each neurological disease category was conducted through simple linear regression using dummy coding (dichotomous outcomes) for the neurological disease category. Pearson correlation matrices were constructed to assess pair-wise relationships between variables. Cohen’s standard was used to evaluate the strength of the relationships, where coefficients between ±0.10 and ±0.29 represent a small effect size, coefficients between ±0.30 and ±0.49 represent a moderate effect size, and coefficients of ±0.50 and above indicate a large effect size (Cohen, 1998). The result of the correlations was examined using Holm corrections to adjust for multiple comparisons based on α = 0.05. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to assess if there were significant differences in COVID-19 severity or comorbidities score between the levels of neurological disease category. Tukey pairwise comparisons were conducted for all significant effects based on α = 0.05. For each statistical test, only data from patients with all variables investigated were included. Cases with missing data were excluded from analysis. As such, the n for each test or summary is reported.",
            "Of an initial 4,611 records retrieved, 4,372 were excluded as per our exclusion criteria (Figure 1). A total of 239 articles were included in an overall assessment for the prevalence of neurological conditions reported in all patients with confirmed COVID-19 (n = 2,307) (Figure 2). The prevalence of COVID-19 patients with neurological conditions were assessed by age (years) from a total of 230 articles (n = 584) in which individual ages could be extracted (Table 1). Patient diagnoses were categorized under the following general neurological conditions: cerebrovascular disease (CVD), peripheral neuropathies, encephalopathies, demyelinating diseases, smell and/or taste disorders, and CNS inflammatory diseases. An additional category of “other” was ascribed to patients who exhibited neurological symptoms, but the underlying cause was not determined or identified (Figure 2). Smell and/or taste disorders were the most prevalent neurological manifestation with 1,303 cases identified, or 56.5% of the total. CVD, including stroke and microhemorrhages, was seen less frequently, but impacted approximately one quarter of the total (n = 584). Each of the remaining neurological conditions comprised less than ten percent of the total reported with encephalopathy and “other” accounting for 5.3% (n = 122) and 6.8% (n = 156), respectively. Less prevalent, but nonetheless significant neurological conditions also reported include peripheral neuropathy [e.g., Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and critical illness neuromyopathy (CIM)], CNS inflammatory disease (e.g., encephalitis and myelitis), and demyelinating disease [e.g., multifocal demyelinating lesions and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)], constituting a respective 3.3% (n = 75), 2.1% (n = 49), and 0.8% (n = 18) of the total subjects.",

When possible, sex, COVID-19 severity, comorbidities, and the presence of detectable virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were also captured. As described above, neurological diagnoses were broadly categorized under CVD, CNS inflammatory disease, demyelinating disease, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, taste/smell disorders, and other. Frequencies and percentages of individual diagnoses included under these categories are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The most frequently reported CVD was stroke of various types (n = 230, 89%). Among CNS inflammatory diseases, meningoencephalitis was most frequently observed (n = 22, 47%). Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) was the most frequently reported demyelinating disease (n = 9, 60%). Within the category of encephalopathy, a diagnosis of various types of encephalopathy were reported with the highest frequency (n = 47, 83%), while different manifestations of GBS were the most frequently observed peripheral neuropathy (n = 54, 84%). Loss of smell (anosmia) was the most frequent complication of taste/smell disorders (n = 11, 31%) and various manifestations of headache (n = 18, 49%) were the most frequently reported neurological manifestation categorized as “other,” which includes neurological manifestations for which the underlying cause was not identified.",

Risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, and hyperlipidemia, were the most frequent comorbidities among COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations (Supplementary Table 2). To assess the association of the stated comorbidities with neurological manifestations, comorbidities were limited to HTN, DM, obesity, and lipid disorders, which includes hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia.

Summary statistics for individual patient data were calculated for each variable, and frequencies and percentages were split by sex and reported in Table 3. Frequencies and percentages were only calculated on available data (n/a = not available excluded). This is reflected in the n reported for each variable. The most frequently observed neurological disease category for all patients regardless of sex, specified or not, was cerebrovascular disease (n = 257, 50% of total). Moderate COVID-19 severity was most often reported for all male and female subjects, however, patients for which sex was not specified (n = 57), severe COVID-19 was most frequently reported.

More specific details relating the number and percent of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with neurological conditions are stratified by decade of age and included in Table 1. Overall, patients 60–69 years showed the greatest population with neurological conditions (n = 154) and those less than or equal to 9 years of age had the least (n = 7) (Table 1 and Figure 4).

In contrast, taste/smell disorder was associated with decreased age, F(1,508) = 28.73, p < 0.001, r2 = 0.05, indicating that approximately 5% of the variance in this category is explainable by age (Figure 5F). A mild, but nonetheless statistically significant inverse relationship between age and CNS inflammatory disease or other was also observed. Approximately 1% of the variance in observation of COVID-19 patients with CNS inflammatory disease [F(1,508) = 7.19, p = 0.008, r2 = 0.01] or other [F(1,508) = 6.70, p = 0.01, r2 = 0.01] is also explainable by decreased age (Figures 5D,G).

            "In agreement with the linear regression analyses, a significant positive correlation between age and CVD was seen (p < 0.001) with a coefficient (rp) of 0.24, indicating a small effect size (Figure 6A). Small effect size was also observed with age and CNS inflammatory disease (rp = −0.12, p = 0.008), smell and/or taste disorder (rp = −0.23, p < 0.001), and other (rp = −0.11, p = 0.01), all of which show a negative correlation with age (Figure 6A).

Although the relationship between age and “other” was found to be statistically significant with a small effect size (rp = 0.12, p = 0.023), the wide variety of conditions included in this category do not point to any one condition as being significant.",

Age retained the strongest relationship with CVD, however, a significant positive correlation of CVD with HTN (rp = 0.16, p = 0.002), DM (rp = 0.13, p = 0.014), lipid disorders (rp = 0.19, p < 0.001), and severe COVID-19 (rp = 0.19, p < 0.001) were also seen. Encephalopathy correlated positively with severe COVID-19 (rp = 0.18, p = 0.001) and was seen most frequently among individuals with comorbid conditions categorized as “other” (rp = 0.11, p = 0.033). CNS inflammatory disease showed a positive correlation with moderate COVID-19 severity (rp = 0.17, p = 0.002), as well as patients without comorbid disease (rp = 0.17, p = 0.001). No significant relationship between comorbidities and demyelinating disease was observed, however, it did correlate with critical COVID-19 (rp = 0.22, p < 0.001). These results, however, may be less reliable due to a low number of patients within this neurological disease category (n = 12). There appears to be a small positive relationship between demyelinating disease and obesity, however, this did not reach statistical significance. Like demyelinating disease, obesity had a positive association with critical COVID-19 (rp = 0.30, p < 0.001). Peripheral neuropathy correlated with mild COVID-19 (rp = 0.19, p < 0.001) but not with any comorbid condition. Interestingly, impaired taste/smell only reached significant positive associations with asymptomatic COVID-19 (rp = 0.19, p < 0.001) and no comorbidities (rp = 0.24, p < 0.001). Although the reason for this is unclear, in the absence of more critical symptoms, impairments in taste and/or smell may be more discernable by patients.",

            "In addition to age, COVID-19 severity and comorbidities appeared to associate with the observance of specific neurological disease (Figure 7). Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) to assess if there were significant differences in the linear combination of COVID-19 severity and comorbidities score between the levels of neurological disease category after controlling for age were attempted, however, these tests failed assumptions of homogeneity of covariance and covariate-independent variable independence. As such, ANOVAs were performed separately to assess whether there were significant differences in COVID-19 severity or comorbidities score by neurological disease category. This demonstrated significant differences in the mean COVID-19 severity and comorbidities score among the different neurological disease categories (Figure 8). Demyelinating disease, CVD, and encephalopathy had the highest mean COVID-19 severity and comorbidities score, while loss of taste/smell had the lowest for both, demonstrating a relationship between disease severity and comorbid conditions. To aid viewing, neuronal disease categories were reordered by increasing mean of the two variables (Figure 8).",

Loss of taste/smell had the lowest mean COVID-19 severity and comorbidities score. Data were derived from the same subjects. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001.",
            "Neurological manifestations are a significant complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Although many anecdotal and case study reports have suggested relationships between neurological complications of disease with age, disease severity, and comorbid conditions, significant associations among these variables remain unclear. Through a systematic review of peer-reviewed, published patient reports spanning the entirety of 2020 through April 4, 2021, and meta-analyses, we report that while smell and/or taste disorders are the most common neurological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, CVD, manifesting almost entirely as stroke, is a major neurological complication of infection, affecting just over a quarter of individuals in this study. Other clinically significant CNS complications, broadly categorized as encephalopathy, CNS inflammatory disease, demyelinating disease, and peripheral neuropathy have been reported less frequently. Other symptoms, including headache, seizure, aphasia, and ataxia have also been reported in connection with infection without identification of the underlying cause and are categorized as “other” in this report.",
            "When investigating a potential relationship between the type of neurological disorder and age, smell and/or taste disorders remained the most common neurological complication affecting infected individuals 50 years of age and younger. For infected individuals over 50, however, CVD became the most common neurological injury, where it was observed in over half of individuals in this age group. Linear regression analysis, however, suggests only 6% of the variance in CVD is explainable by age. Known risk factors for vascular disease, HTN and DM, as well as critical COVID-19, showed a positive correlation with CVD but with a small effect size. Additionally, stroke affected individuals across the lifespan, including individuals with reported no comorbidities and/or asymptomatic disease. Together, this suggests other factors, which may include virus and/or the host’s response to infection, contribute to the development of CVD.",
            "Although there is currently no clear indicator as to which patients will suffer stroke, several risk factors for stroke in aged individuals have been reported in COVID-19 patients, such as coagulopathy, elevated D-dimer levels, and vascular endothelial dysfunction. A large retrospective study evaluating risk factors for mortality of COVID-19 patients found coagulopathy to be a significant indicator, affecting ∼50% of non-survivors (Zhou et al., 2020). Additionally, marked elevation (<0.5 μg/L) of D-dimer, a by-product of blood clotting that is often elevated in response to acute vascular disease, has been reported in COVID-19 patients and found to be predictive of severe disease and mortality (Gao et al., 2020; Han et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).",
            "Endothelial cell infection and/or injury may also contribute to increased risk for CVD with COVID-19. ACE2, the principal receptor used for viral entry, is reportedly expressed by endothelial cells throughout the body, including brain (Hamming et al., 2004; To and Lo, 2004), indicating the potential for viral infection in the endothelium in the CNS. In support of this notion, a post-mortem investigation reported the presence of endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis across the vascular beds of several organs (Varga et al., 2020). Although the brain was not evaluated in this study, the presence of endothelial infection of multiple organs reveals the potential for widespread disruption of vascular homeostasis, increasing the susceptibility of infected patients to CVD. Interestingly, endotheliopathy without evidence of infection has been reported in a cohort of COVID-19 patients (mean age = 62 years), which was associated with severe disease (Goshua et al., 2020). This suggests that the host response to infection may sufficiently promote endothelial cell inflammation and injury, without direct involvement of the virus.",
            "In agreement with endotheliopathy in the CNS, several autopsy and neuroimaging reports demonstrate the presence of brain microvascular lesions and microhemorrhages in COVID-19 patients (Conklin et al., 2020; Fitsiori et al., 2020; Kremer et al., 2020b; Lee et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020; Radmanesh et al., 2020; Shoskes et al., 2020). Autopsy findings reveal intact endothelium, suggesting that microbleeds may form due to inflammation of endothelial cells that allows for extravasation of red blood cells into the brain parenchyma (Goshua et al., 2020; Pugin et al., 2020). Cerebral microhemorrhages are associated with age and systemic disease, increasing the risk for microhemorrhage development in older patients with COVID-19. Moreover, the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) decreases with age and is posited to precede and contribute to the development of CVD (Li et al., 2018). The mechanisms of BBB dysfunction in aging are not completely clear; however, small atheromatous plaques, HTN, and endothelial cell inflammation are believed to play a prominent role and may help explain why individuals with underlying comorbidities, including DM and HTN, appear to be at greater risk for developing more severe COVID-19. Additionally, chronic, subclinical inflammation is a common feature of aging that increases the susceptibility of individuals to age-related disease (Franceschi et al., 2000). Chronic inflammation can induce cellular stress and injury that weakens tissues and reduces the ability of cells to counter additional insults. It is reasonable, therefore, that aging-associated inflammation promotes endotheliitis and endotheliopathy, leading to increased “leakiness” of the vasculature that is made more severe with COVID-19.",
            "In addition to CVD, more frequent observations of clinically significant encephalopathy and peripheral neuropathy are also seen in patients over 50 years. Patients with encephalopathy, which is broadly characterized as disease or damage to the brain that affects brain function, present with altered mental status ranging from mild confusion to more severe dementia or coma. Several case reports detail infected patients presenting with acute encephalopathic episodes, irrespective of COVID-19 severity, including acute necrotizing encephalopathy and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Encephalopathy accounted for only 5.3% of the total population of COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations and 10.4% of those over 50 years of age. It is highly probable, however, that due to the strong inflammatory response to infection in the periphery, which can negatively impact the CNS, encephalopathy among infected individuals occurs more frequently but not widely reported in case studies.",
            "Peripheral neuropathy, including Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and critical illness neuromyopathy, have emerged as one of the more serious neurological complications of COVID-19 infection. GBS is a neuromuscular disorder defined as an acute paralytic neuropathy, often preceded by an infection, and clinically characterized by symmetric weakness of the limbs (Yuki and Hartung, 2012). This disease is considered, primarily, to be an affliction of the peripheral nerves that has a 5% fatality rate and results in the severe disability of up 20% of GBS patients (Hughes et al., 2007; Yuki and Hartung, 2012). Critical illness neuromyopathy is characterized by muscle wasting and paralysis and often culminates into a severely disabling weakness of the muscles and/or paralysis (Latronico et al., 2007; Guarneri et al., 2008). In this review, we found that peripheral neuropathy was most frequent among older adults (6.6%, n = 44), with zero cases of critical illness neuromyopathy reported in patients younger than 60 years of age.",
            "Less frequent observations of CNS inflammatory disease, demyelinating disease, and smell and/or taste disorders was seen among older adults, as compared to younger adults and patients under 19 years of age (children). CNS inflammatory disorders, which includes encephalitis, myelitis, and meningitis, was most frequently reported among patients under 19 years, while demyelinating disease was similar in frequency among the three age categories. Interestingly, the demyelinating disease, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), which is a rare but serious complication of viral infection most commonly affecting young children, was seen more frequently in older adults (72.8%, n = 8), as compared to younger adults (18.1%, n = 2) and children (9.1%, n = 1), in this review. Impaired smell and/or taste was seen at a high frequency in all age groupings but was the principal manifestation affecting children and young adults and the second most common complication among individuals over 50 years.",
            "How SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes the development of neurological complications is unclear and may involve several factors (Figure 9). Brain autopsy and CSF analyses seldom report detectable virus in the CNS compartment, however, the neuroinvasive character of other huCoVs suggest SARS-CoV-2 may also infect the CNS (Arbour et al., 2000) and has been demonstrated in a limited number of infected individuals (Filatov et al., 2020; Moriguchi et al., 2020; Poyiadji et al., 2020; Schurink et al., 2020). While the presence of virus in the CNS compartment and mechanism of entry is not fully elucidated, it is highly likely that SARS-CoV-2 is able to gain access to the brain through nasal epithelial cells. ACE2 is highly expressed in nasal epithelium, pointing to the olfactory bulb as a probable point of entry (Sungnak et al., 2020). Infected olfactory epithelial cells may then transfer virus to closely situated olfactory neurons, allowing for retrograde axonal transport into the CNS compartment. In support of this, unilateral oblation of the olfactory bulb prior to intranasal inoculation of a neurotropic coronavirus prevented CNS entry and viral spread in mouse brain (Perlman et al., 1990).",
            "COVID-19 pathology in the CNS: primary impacts and potential mechanisms. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 primarily impacts the lungs, often leading to a hypoxic state and resulting in a robust increase in proinflammatory cytokine production. This may ultimately cause a “cytokine storm” and/or activate glia in the brain. Should such events occur, there is potential for hypoxemia or hypoxia, exacerbated “cytokine storm,” and/or infiltration of peripheral immune cells through endothelial cell infection to occur within the brain; any of which can result in significant brain injury to the infected patient. Although currently unclear, if SARS-CoV-2 can establish a productive or even non-productive infection within the CNS compartment, persistent inflammation and/or impaired cell function may result, increasing the potential for serious injury of the brain and/or pathological brain aging. Created with BioRender.com.",
            "Hematological entry of virus into the CNS also cannot be ruled out. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in endothelial cells throughout the body of infected subjects and, given the prevalence of endothelial ACE2 expression, SARS-CoV-2 may be found in brain endothelium (Hamming et al., 2004; Varga et al., 2020). Post-mortem analyses of human and non-human primate brain revealed hCoV-299E in brain endothelial cells (Cabirac et al., 1995). Viral infection of the endothelial cells by coronavirus has been found to cause inflammation of the endothelial cells which disrupts vascular homeostasis and coagulation, suggesting an increased risk for CVD, as a result (Cabirac et al., 1995; Varga et al., 2020).",
            "Even in the absence of direct neuronal or neural cell infection, hypoxia/hypoxemia, coagulopathy, and uncontrolled inflammation or “cytokine storm” can also negatively impact the CNS and cognition (Figure 9). Indeed, most clinical evidence suggests neurological complications of COVID-19 are due to secondary effects of infection, including reduced O2 and hyperimmune responses, often referred to as “cytokine storm.” Serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [e.g., interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)] in COVID-19 patients are significantly predictive and/or correlative to the severity of infection and mortality (Chen T. et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Previously, SARS-CoV patients with severe disease were found to have elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and reduced levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), in comparison to patients with mild disease (Chien et al., 2006). Indeed, virus-associated diseases of the nervous system, such as acute necrotizing encephalopathy, are associated with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum and CSF. As such, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum of severe COVID-19 patients may promote inflammation in brain and contribute to the neurological manifestations of disease (Kansagra and Gallentine, 2011; Sun et al., 2019).",
            "The long-term consequences of COVID-19-associated nervous system injury and/or dysfunction is currently unknown, however, reports continue to emerge describing persistent symptoms of disease months after resolution of infection, including impaired smell and/or taste, chronic fatigue, and impaired cognition. Long-term complications of infection are referred to as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or Long COVID and evidence for this complication is seen with other viruses that induce neurological disease, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), West Nile virus, and multiple herpes- and picornaviruses. It is not entirely clear if SARS-CoV-2 directly infects neurons and/or non-neuronal cells of the CNS and, if so, whether virus is eradicated from these sites with recovery of COVID-19. The significance of this important consideration is seen in a single case report of a 78-year-old woman who recovered from COVID-19 but succumbed to a sudden cardiac arrest prior to hospital discharge (Yao et al., 2020). Although this individual had three consecutive SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative nasopharyngeal swabs, postmortem investigation of multiple tissues, excluding brain, revealed residual virus in lung (Yao et al., 2020). These findings suggest that the virus may not be completely cleared in some patients that appear to have recovered and raises the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may evade immune surveillance, at least to some degree. It is important to note that replication-competency of virus found in lung of this patient was not determined and remains an important scientific and clinical question. This would have major implications for the brain if replication-competent virus persists in the CNS compartment after recovery. Even an abortive infection, if present, could negatively impact cell function and impair brain homeostasis. Alternatively, or in addition to direct viral involvement, chronic neuroinflammation can contribute to impaired brain homeostasis through production of soluble factors that directly and/or indirectly impair neuronal function. Clinical follow-up and prospective observational studies are critical for assessing long-term neurological outcomes of patients recovered from COVID-19. While this is a likely standard for follow-up of individuals who were diagnosed with serious neurological manifestations, functional and cognitive decline may continue after recovery among COVID-19 patients for whom neurological disease was not identified. There is significant evidence that supports the notion that these individuals, particularly those recovered from severe COVID-19, may have difficulty performing critical functions long after recovery, including reduced job performance and/or ability to attend to activities of daily living, that may worsen over time.",
            "Limited studies are available that investigate the long-term neurological consequences of COVID-19 and do not include neurological assessments but have relied on neuropsychological testing and self-reports. A large cross-sectional study involving cognitive assessments of subjects who had recovered from COVID-19 demonstrated impairment in a variety of cognitive domains and a lower global cognitive performance score, with worsening performance associated with the severity of respiratory disease (Hampshire et al., 2020). This may suggest irreversible injury to the brain due to reduced oxygen and/or chronic subclinical unresolved neuroinflammation, two factors that play a major role in pathologic brain aging. Importantly, minor deficits were even seen among individuals who had experienced only mild respiratory symptoms. Additional follow-up of these individuals is needed to assess the course of symptoms with increased recovery time. It is important to note that testing was performed on-line, rather than by a board-certified neuropsychologist. In a separate assessment of self-reports from subjects at 6-month post-infection, sleep difficulties, anxiety, and depression were the most commonly reported complaints, in addition to fatigue and muscle weakness (Huang et al., 2021).",
            "Evidence of injury at the level of the CNS is very limited at this time, however, a functional imaging study of patients with persistent anosmia following recovery of SARS-CoV-2 infection displayed reduced metabolism in bilateral limbic cortices and the insular cortex of the left hemisphere, as compared to controls (Donegani et al., 2021). This suggests brain involvement in SARS-CoV-2-associated anosmia that may also impact cognitive function, as these brain regions are involved in multiple cognitive processes, including learning and memory, word, face, and body recognition, and consciousness. The insular cortices are also involved in taste, which is often impaired in SARS-CoV-2 infection, alone or concurrent with impaired smell, which may implicate injury within in this region among individuals suffering loss of taste and/or smell. With the potential for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with the world-wide introduction of multiple vaccines, more comprehensive follow-up of recovered patients is likely to become an urgent public health concern, including neurological work-up and neuropsychological and/or psychiatric assessments.",
            "This systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis has demonstrated that neurological manifestations are a common complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 that effects individuals across the lifespan, with all severities of COVID-19, and with or without comorbidities. Consistently emerging case reports and retrospective studies detailing the neurological impact of COVID-19, point to the necessity for investigating the impact of hyperimmune responses and/or reduced oxygen more thoroughly on neuronal injury. In addition, the neuroinvasive potential of the virus should not be ruled outs, as neurological conditions may be seen as a presenting symptom of infection and arise in the absence of respiratory disease. Further, as SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to devastating neurological diseases irrespective of age, sex, or comorbidities, targeted studies of the COVID-19 population are imperative to better understand and elucidate the true impact of COVID-19 on the CNS. COVID-19 patients need to be followed for potential long-term neurological sequelae after recovery from infection, including pathologic brain aging, that likely plays a key role in PASC. With multiple vaccines now available, we may continue to see a reduction in new cases and/or disease severity, however, the potential for CNS complications remains a major clinical and public health concern.",

            "Persistence of symptoms beyond the initial 3 to 4 weeks after infection is defined as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). A wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms like anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep disorders and cognitive disturbances have been observed in PACS. The review was conducted based on PRISMA-S guidelines for literature search strategy for systematic reviews. A cytokine storm in COVID-19 may cause a breach in the blood brain barrier leading to cytokine and SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain. This triggers an immune response in the brain by activating microglia, astrocytes, and other immune cells leading to neuroinflammation. Various inflammatory biomarkers like inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, acute phase proteins and adhesion molecules have been implicated in psychiatric disorders and play a major role in the precipitation of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Impaired adult neurogenesis has been linked with a variety of disorders like depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, and dementia. Persistence of neuroinflammation was observed in COVID-19 survivors 3 months after recovery. Chronic neuroinflammation alters adult neurogenesis with pro-inflammatory cytokines supressing anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines favouring adult neurogenesis. Based on the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms/disorders in PACS, there is more possibility for a potential impairment in adult neurogenesis in COVID-19 survivors. This narrative review aims to discuss the various neuroinflammatory processes during PACS and its effect on adult neurogenesis.",
            "The first case of COVID-19 caused by SARS-COV-2 virus was reported in Wuhan, China on 31st December 2019 and since then the disease has spread to 228 countries throughout the globe (Worldometer, 2022). The incubation period of the SARS-COV-2 virus ranges between 5.1 and 11.5 days with most people developing symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine (Lauer et al., 2020). The severity of this disease has a wide range with symptoms like fever, cold, cough, breathing difficulty, pneumonia, other body systems failure and even death has been noted in very severe cases of COVID-19 (WHO, 2022). People with younger age mostly act as asymptomatic carriers whilst the older age group is the most vulnerable group with high severity and mortality (Nuzzo et al., 2021). People with older age (greater than 60 years), pregnancy, chronic pulmonary disease conditions, diabetes and hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and health care workers are high-risk groups for COVID-19 (Ceriello, Stoian & Rizzo, 2020; Huang et al., 2020; WHO, 2022; Wiersinga et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).",
            "Acute COVID-19 has been defined as the period that extends from the onset of symptoms to 3 to 4 weeks. Any symptoms persisting beyond this period are categorized as post-acute COVID-19, where the SARS-COV-2 virus is not detectable (Nalbandian et al., 2021). Similar patterns of persistence of symptoms have been noted previously during the SARS epidemic and MERS outbreak (Ahmed et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2005). A thorough understanding of this phenomenon is vital for the prognosis of the patients as well as to equip healthcare settings to aid in diagnosis and treatment. The post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) involves multiple organ systems (Nalbandian et al., 2021) and the pathophysiology is held to be different from that of acute COVID-19 (Dixit et al., 2021). Garg et al. (2020) state that PACS is the persistence of symptoms which is sought to be linked with residual inflammation from the convalescent phase of viral replication, organ damage, extended ventilation, or idiopathic (nonspecific) effects of hospitalization. PACS is observed not only in those who had severe forms of COVID-19 but also in outpatients (Montani et al., 2022).",
            "Neuropsychiatric symptoms during the acute stage as well as post-acute COVID-19 are not uncommon ranging from cognitive impairment, delirium, mood changes, and extreme fatigue (Rubin, 2020; Woo et al., 2020). Incidences of dementia, anxiety, and insomnia were noted even after 3 months post-infection (Czeisler et al., 2020). Various studies that assessed the neuropsychiatric symptoms, 14 days to 6 months following acute COVID-19, noted a higher prevalence of symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and PTSD (Montani et al., 2022). There is conflicting evidence concerning the association between disorders. Several studies showed the relation between the two while several others could not replicate this result (Montani et al., 2022). Though the etiology for such long-lasting effects on the neuropsychiatric facet is still being studied and ever evolving, a few intricate mechanisms have been postulated in the literature. Some of them include biological and environmental factors (Nakamura et al., 2021), virus-induced autoimmunity (Achar & Ghosh, 2020), coagulopathy leading to multi-organ system failure (Achar & Ghosh, 2020), and direct viral infiltration into the nervous system through ACE2 receptor (Gupta et al., 2021; Saikarthik, Saraswathi & Al-Atram, 2021). In an interesting study by Yapici-Eser et al. (2021), it was proposed that SARS-COV-2 proteins mainly the non-structural protein group (NSP) and spike protein mimic various growth factors, such as FGF (1, 2, 4 types), VEGF2, GDNF, IGF, etc. It was hypothesized that such protein mimicking interactions could potentially be associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and variation in risk factors could trigger different pathways presenting with different phenotypes of the disease (Yapici-Eser et al., 2021).",
            "Several mechanisms have been proposed previously in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the neuropsychiatric symptoms in PACS and their impact is believed to have long-term consequences which is not much explored. Neuroinflammation has been known to affect cognition, behaviour by means of disrupted BBB, neurotransmission and also by means of impaired neurogenesis (Klein et al., 2021). This narrative review reviews the available literature to address the possible mechanism of COVID-19-induced neuroinflammation as a cause for the various neuropsychiatric symptoms and also to explore the plausible association of impaired neurogenesis in PACS. This timely summary of recent developments would provide a definitive path to researchers, to better understand the pathophysiological basis which would aid in managing the neuropsychiatric symptoms during PACS.",
            "This study used the narrative review method along with PRISMA-S, which is an extension of PRISMA guidelines for reporting literature search strategies in systematic reviews (Rethlefsen et al., 2021). Due to the scarcity of studies on the effect of COVID-19 on adult neurogenesis, as well as lack of homogeneity in the already published literature, a narrative review style was chosen (Harvey, Schofield & Williden, 2018). Electronic searches were made in databases such as Pubmed, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, Google scholar, and ResearchGate as well as preprint databases such as medRxiv and Research Square. General Google searches were done to report the latest number of COVID-19 cases globally. Being a narrative review, multiple combinations of words were used as search strategies. Some of the words that were used included “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “adult neurogenesis”, “adult hippocampal neurogenesis”, “neuroinflammation”, “hippocampus”, “neuropsychiatric symptoms”, “neuropsychiatric disorders”, “Post-Acute COVID-19 syndrome”, “long COVID-19”, etc. A combination of these words were also used, for example, “neuroinflammation and COVID-19”, “neurogenesis and SARS-CoV-2”. In addition, author names and a list of references were used for search of related references. The last search in the above-mentioned databases was made on 15.06.2022. After reading the abstracts those articles that did not match the requirements of this narrative review were excluded. Articles and preprints in the English language in both clinical and pre-clinical studies were included in this narrative review. Any duplication of articles was removed using the EndNote reference manager (Version 20).",
            "Survivors of earlier infections caused by other coronaviruses like MERS and SARS presented with an increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders like anxiety, depression, and PTSD (Hopkins et al., 1999; Rogers et al., 2020). Cognitive decline, decreased mental processing speed, and impairment in memory, attention, and concentration were observed in SARS survivors 1 year after the onset of the disease (Hopkins et al., 1999). A comprehensive systematic review by Rogers et al. (2020) found that out of the 20 neurological and neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19 that were studied, non-specific symptoms like headache (20.7% (16.1–26.1%)) and anosmia (43.1% (35.2–51.3%)) and core psychiatric disorders of depression (23% (11.8–40.2%)) and anxiety (15.9% (5.6–37.7%)) were found to be highly prevalent. The non-specific symptoms like anosmia, dysgeusia, weakness, and fatigue were the most common, occurring in more than 30% of the patients (Rogers et al., 2020). Many of these complications are capable of becoming a chronic condition and many of the symptoms in PACS could be a continuation of those from the acute phase of the disease (Carfì, Bernabei & Landi, 2020). Survivors of critical illness after discharge from the hospital were found to have a higher prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders like depression, anxiety, and PTSD (Nikayin et al., 2016; Parker et al., 2015; Rabiee et al., 2016). Most of the neuropsychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 were found to be common in patients with milder forms of the disease (Rogers et al., 2020). Thus, the neuropsychiatric symptoms/disorders are observed in survivors of COVID-19 irrespective of the disease severity which can become chronic.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus, a positive sense single stranded RNA virus. Its surface is enveloped with crown-like spikes like other coronaviruses. The spike protein which is responsible for host specificity and tissue tropism is a type-1 glycoprotein. It includes two subunits, S1 for host receptor binding and S2 for the fusion of viral and host cell membrane (Gallagher & Buchmeier, 2001). The cell receptor through which SARS-CoV-2 binds to the host is the ACE2 receptor. The S1 subunit binds with the ACE2 receptor followed by the fusion of S1 to the cell membrane which is mediated by S2. Priming/cleavage of the S1 and S2 subunits is performed by TMPRSS2, a serine protease that is a member of the Hepsin/TMPRSS subfamily (Hoffmann et al., 2020).",
            "SARS-CoV-2-associated central nerve system (CNS) disease has complex and varied pathogenesis. The propensity of the virus to enter the CNS is widely studied. There are three possible routes of viral entry into CNS viz. transmucosal invasion, hematogenous spread, and retrograde neuronal dissemination (Pezzini & Padovani, 2020). SARS-CoV-2 can cross the neural-mucosal interface by infecting the olfactory neurons or diffuse through the channels that are formed by the ensheathing cells of olfactory mucosa and enter the CNS. The virus then may travel along the olfactory tract and reach different areas of the brain connected to it by axonal transport, trans-synaptic transport, or microfusion (Meinhardt et al., 2021; Van Riel, Verdijk & Kuiken, 2015). SARS-CoV-2 can breach the peripheral nerve terminals and can reach the CNS through the trans-synaptic route. It can invade peripheral chemoreceptors and cranial nerves and reach the brain stem (Li, Bai & Hashikawa, 2020). SARS-CoV-2 can also likely enter CNS through gut-brain axis via the enteric nerves (Esposito et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2021). In the hematogenous spread, the virus disseminates the circulation and may breach the blood-brain barrier or blood-CSF barrier to enter the brain or through circumventricular organs that lack blood brain barrier (BBB) (Pezzini & Padovani, 2020). In the Trojan horse mechanism, virus-infected leucocytes may cross the BBB to enter CNS (Desforges et al., 2020) (Fig. 1).",
            "A cytokine storm is currently considered to be the trademark attribute of the pathogenesis of COVID-19. It is a destructive systemic hyperinflammatory response. It involves autocrine and paracrine activation of various immune cells such as mast cells, macrophages, leucocytes, and endothelial cells which causes increased levels of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, IL-8, tissue necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), chemokine (C-C-motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL5, IL-17, IL-18, IL-33, CXCL-10, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (Azkur et al., 2020; Kempuraj et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Nile et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 infection activates both immediate and late immune responses in the body. SARS-CoV-2 being a novel coronavirus, there is no prior exposure for the human immune system to this virus and hence it is the innate immune system that acts as the first line of defence (Serrano-Castro et al., 2020). The precise mechanism of immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is not yet fully understood. SARS-CoV-2 which enters the body gets attacked by innate immune cells and the severity of the disease will depend on the capacity of the innate immune system to ward off the virus (Zhu et al., 2020). Coronaviruses are capable of facilitating innate immune suppression and inhibiting adaptive immunity (Oh et al., 2016). Mast cells, macrophages/monocytes, natural killer cells, neutrophils, T lymphocytes, and resident tissue endothelial and epithelial cells are the innate immune cells that get activated by SARS-CoV-2 and are responsible for the cytokine storm in lungs (Azkur et al., 2020; Kempuraj et al., 2020; Kritas et al., 2020). From the initial infection and lysis of the cells (mostly pneumocytes), DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) and PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) are produced which activate the innate immune system. DAMPs include cellular contents released from dying cells and proteins released following tissue injury like heat shock protein, heparin sulphate, hyaluronan fragments and PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) include oxidized phospholipids and viral RNAs (Imai et al., 2008; Kuipers et al., 2011). These activated immune cells release various pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and histamine which help the immune system to fight off the viral infection by recruiting and activating other innate and adaptive immune cells and antiviral gene expression programs (Vardhana & Wolchok, 2020). However, excess activation of these immune cells causes a worsening of the inflammatory response and an increase in the disease severity (Kempuraj et al., 2020). Lymphopenia induced by cytokine storm impairs the adaptive immune system to produce anti-viral antibodies which is critical in the clearance of the virus (Manjili et al., 2020). Cytokine storm and sustained systemic inflammatory response cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and death in COVID-19 patients (Li et al., 2020).",
            "An increase in pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and lymphopenia associated with decreased CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer cells, and increased cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) were observed in COVID-19 patients (Pedersen & Ho, 2020). The cytokine levels increased during the disease process and declined during the recovery period. Increased levels of IL-6 correlate with mortality and the need for ventilator support (Vardhana & Wolchok, 2020). Patients who are clinically deteriorating were found to present with progressive depletion of lymphocytes while the clinical recovery was preceded by a recovery in lymphocyte count (Chen et al., 2020). The increased levels of IL-6 can further upregulate the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. Thus, lymphopenia and the level of cytokine storm are considered to be the markers for COVID-19 which helps to assess and predict disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients (Debuc & Smadja, 2021; Kempuraj et al., 2020).",
            "Inflammation is the early tissue response to an insult or injury or pathogenic invasion. Neuroinflammation is the inflammatory process in the central nervous system (CNS), which is primarily due to the activation of astrocytes and microglial cells. Astrocytes develop from radial glial cells in due course of neuronal differentiation (Barry & McDermott, 2005) whereas microglia are developed from erythroid-myeloid progenitor cells from fetal yolk sac (Ajami et al., 2007). Microglial cells, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), neurons and the extracellular matrix forms the neurovascular unit (NVU) (Del Zoppo, 2010). The blood-brain barrier varies across each part of the CNS primarily depending on factors such as requirements of the brain region and the diameter of the blood vessel (Rhea & Banks, 2019). The NVU responds to an insult/injury which can lead to disruption of BBB, infiltration of leucocytes, release of inflammatory factors, and activation of microglia & astrocytes (Mracsko & Veltkamp, 2014). Recent studies have shown that microglia and astrocytes exist in a continuum of two extremes as two different phenotypes. Thus, both these cells have pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotypes which depend on the signals received by these cells (Jha, Lee & Suk, 2016).",
            "The extracellular and intracellular signals influence the phenotype of microglia. The pro-inflammatory phenotype of microglia (M1) has been known to increase the level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1β (interleukin 1 beta), IL-6, and IFN-γ. The release of these inflammatory mediators causes neurotoxicity (by excitotoxicity), neurodegenerative diseases (increased immune activation), and cytotoxicity (release of reactive oxygen species) (Block, Zecca & Hong, 2007; Jha, Lee & Suk, 2016; Smith et al., 2012). On the other hand, the anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2) causes a release of transforming growth factor (TGF), IL-10, IL-13, and IL-4 which provides neuroprotection, a release of trophic factors, and resolution of neuroinflammation (Jha, Lee & Suk, 2016; Orihuela, McPherson & Harry, 2016; Wang et al., 2015). Conditions such as hypoxia or ischemia cause activation of astrocytes called “reactive astrocytes” which has a distinct morphology (Faulkner et al., 2004). These astrocytes release a wide variety of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines (John, Lee & Brosnan, 2003). Similar to microglia, astrocytes also exist in two phenotypic forms viz. Pro-inflammatory astrocyte (A1) and anti-inflammatory astrocyte (A2) which has diverse effects on the NVU (Fan & Huo, 2021). A1 phenotype secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, nitric acid, ROS, and glutamate. The A2 phenotype produces neurotrophic factors, thrombospondins, and IL-10 which act as anti-inflammatory mediators (neuroprotective) (Fan & Huo, 2021; Jha, Lee & Suk, 2016).",
            "The cytokine storm in COVID-19 causes disruption of blood-brain barrier and intracranial cytokine storm (Coperchini et al., 2020; Serrano-Castro et al., 2020). Through the disrupted blood-brain barrier, the infiltration of immune cells, and inflammatory cytokines into the brain occurs. This is also one of the pathways of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the brain. All these activate glial cells, endothelial cells, neurons, mast cells, and other immune cells which trigger neuroinflammatory processes (Coperchini et al., 2020; Kempuraj et al., 2020; Serrano-Castro et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 can also enter the cerebral circulation from systemic circulation and attach to ACE2 which is abundant in foot processes of astrocytes, microglia, pericytes, and endothelial cells which are the main cellular element of the blood-brain barrier (Hernández et al., 2021). This process is aided by the sluggish blood flow in cerebral microcirculation, resulting in the disruption of BBB. This in turn will facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into neurons and glial cells where it can infect and replicate and cause neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can not only exacerbate pre-existing neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions but also cause neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders (Baig et al., 2020).",
            "Another possible mechanism by which the pathologic changes in COVID-19 can cause neuroinflammation could be due to a potential dysregulation of renin angiotensin system (RAS). As mentioned earlier, ACE2 plays a major role in the regulation of RAS. There are two arms/axis in RAS, one is the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic arm, and the other is the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic arm. A variety of proteins and enzymes are involved in the RAS. Angiotensinogen is the precursor that gets converted to Angiotensin-I (Ang-I) by renin. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts Ang-I to Angiotensin-II which acts via AT1 (primary mediator) and AT2 receptors to cause vasoconstriction, increase in vascular permeability, inflammation, angiogenesis, thrombosis, and fibrosis. This arm (ACE/Ang-II/AT1) is the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic arm. ACE2 on the other hand inactivates Ang-II by converting it to its antagonistic peptide, Ang (1-7) which binds with Mas receptors and causes vasodilation, and anti-apoptotic, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory effects, and attenuates the signal cascade produced by Ang-II. This arm (ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor) is the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic arm (Rice et al., 2004). It is also believed to exhibit anxiolytic and antidepressant effects (de Melo & Almeida-Santos, 2020). A balance in the ACE/ACE2 ratio is critical to maintain an equilibrium between the two arms of RAS. An imbalance in the ACE/ACE2 ratio was implicated in various pathological conditions including Alzheimer’s disease, pulmonary hypertension, cardiovascular, and renal pathology (Bernardi et al., 2012; Kehoe et al., 2016; Lavrentyev & Malik, 2009; Yuan et al., 2015). SARS-CoV-2 induced downregulation of ACE2 depletes the key component of the protective arm of RAS which could result in an unrestrained activation of the deleterious pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic arm of RAS. Dysregulation of RAS in the brain is linked with neuroinflammation (Labandeira-Garcia et al., 2017; Rodriguez-Perez et al., 2016). Overactivation of RAS by augmentation of local AT1 receptors was found to exacerbate neuroinflammation (Grammatopoulos et al., 2007; Rodriguez-Pallares et al., 2008; Villar-Cheda et al., 2012).",
            "Microglia is a vital innate component of the CNS and astrocytes act as mediators for the SARS-COV-2 infection. Microglia provides anti-viral responses in mild cases and produces neurotoxic effects in severe cases of COVID-19. An increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines caused by both these glial cells can amplify the neuroinflammation and lead to impairment in neurological functions in COVID-19 patients (Vargas et al., 2020). Further, cellular cross-talks between astrocyte, microglia, and endothelial cells are implicated in maintaining the cytokine microenvironment in COVID-19 patients (Matias, Morgado & Gomes, 2019; Vargas et al., 2020). Owing to the important functions of both astrocyte and microglia in homeostasis and during viral episodes, it is highly possible for the involvement of these cells in the post-acute phase of SARS-COV-2 infection.",
            "There are several contradictory pieces of evidence on adult neurogenesis in humans mainly spurred by the lack of direct evidence from live human subjects (Berger, Lee & Thuret, 2020).",
            "The formation of new neurons in the adult brain from neural stem cells and neural progenitor stem cells is called neurogenesis. During embryonic development, it is involved in the formation of the brain, and in the adult brain, it persists in certain areas of specialized microenvironment called the neurogenic niche. The neurogenic niche plays a crucial role in the maintenance and regulation of neural stem cell proliferation and contains various trophic factors, hormones, vasculature, and glial cells that enhance neurogenesis (Mu, Lee & Gage, 2010). New neurons are generated by the neurogenic niche throughout adult life in response to both physiological and pathological stimuli (Fan & Pang, 2017). Neurogenesis involves the generation of new neurons, glial cells, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. It is a complex process that includes cellular proliferation, differentiation, survival, and integration. There are numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors that regulate neurogenesis in an integrated manner. The events in neurogenesis occur in two phases, the early phase of proliferation, fate commitment, and cellular migration and the late phase of development of synaptic circuitry and survival of the neurons (Pathania, Yan & Bordey, 2010). The subventricular zone (SVZ) of lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus are the two sites of adult neurogenesis (Toda et al., 2019).",
            "The stem cells in the subgranular zones get differentiated into neural progenitor cells which become immature neurons and then mature neurons. However, only 15–30% of immature neurons survive the maturation process. The survived mature neurons become granule cells whose axons form the mossy fibers extending to the hilus and CA3 region and their dendrites in the molecular layer receive connections from the entorhinal cortex. Over a period of several weeks, they show increased synaptic plasticity and become indistinguishable from other older granule cells (Kempermann, Song & Gage, 2015). Newborn neurons at the subventricular zone migrate to the striatum and they differentiate to form striatal interneurons and in rodents, they migrate along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) and differentiate to form interneurons of the olfactory bulb (Shohayeb et al., 2018). Neurogenesis in the hippocampus is a unique form of brain plasticity that plays a crucial role in memory, learning, pattern separation, and cognitive flexibility.",
            "Dysregulation of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus is associated with psychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline in psychiatric and neurological disorders (Toda et al., 2019). In addition to the role of neurogenesis in physiological conditions, the newly generated neurons also move to sites of brain injury and form the endogenous repair system (Apple, Fonseca & Kokovay, 2017). It has been found that apart from SGZ and SVZ, certain areas of the adult brain like the neocortex, tegmentum, substantia nigra, amygdala, brainstem, and spinal cord also retain some neurogenic potential. However, more explorations are needed to confirm this and elucidate the functional significance (Fan & Pang, 2017) (Fig. 2).",
            "NSC, neural stem cell; NB, neuroblast; IN, immature neuron; MN, mature neuron; CA1 and CA3, Cornu Ammonis 1 and 3 regions.",
            "Research studying adult neurogenesis in COVID-19 and COVID-19 survivors is scarce. However, extrapolation of the results of some recent studies allows for a speculation that adult neurogenesis can have a role to play in the neuropsychiatric symptoms/disorders in COVID-19 and PACS.",
            "Firstly, neuropsychiatric disorders like depression, anxiety, and PTSD are found to be prevalent in COVID-19 survivors (Rogers et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2021). Recent studies postulate a potentially increased risk of developing and/or worsening existing neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease in COVID-19 patients (Brundin, Nath & Beckham, 2020; Ciaccio et al., 2021; Leta et al., 2021; Sulzer et al., 2020). One of the common features of these neuropsychiatric conditions is that they correlate well with cognitive deficits, mood dysregulation, and a reduction in hippocampal volume and they display impaired adult neurogenesis (DeCarolis & Eisch, 2010).",
            "Secondly, brain imaging studies revealed a negative correlation between hippocampal grey matter volume and loss of memory, and severity of post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSS) in COVID-19 survivors (Lu et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2021). Memory acquisition depends on newborn neurons and a decrease in adult hippocampal neurogenesis is implicated in the impairment of acquisition of memory (Misane et al., 2013; Recinto et al., 2012). Though the studies found an increase in gray matter volume in COVID-19 survivors 3 months and 1 year after their recovery, it could be attributed to the ongoing nature of the traumatic event of the pandemic with elevated levels of stress and anxiety and a compensatory response (Lu et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2021).",
            "Thirdly, anosmia is a key feature of acute COVID-19 and is also observed in PACS (Araújo, Arata & Figueiredo, 2021; Aziz et al., 2021). Recent brain imaging studies show dysfunction, abnormalities, and atrophy of the olfactory bulb in COVID-19 patients and patients suffering from PACS who presented with anosmia (Chiu et al., 2021; Galougahi et al., 2020; Kandemirli et al., 2021). Neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb is essential for the sense of smell and anosmia is associated with impaired adult olfactory neurogenesis (Boesveldt et al., 2017; Lledo & Valley, 2016). In addition, anosmia is an important pre-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease which appears to have no direct association with the neurodegenerative process of substantia nigra but seems to be related to impaired adult neurogenesis (Marxreiter, Regensburger & Winkler, 2013; Winner, Kohl & Gage, 2011). COVID-19 is theorized to cause defects in the dopamine system, loss of dopaminergic neurons, and an exacerbation of clinical features of Parkinson’s disease (Brundin, Nath & Beckham, 2020; Sulzer et al., 2020).",
            "Finally, the role of ACE2 in adult neurogenesis in COVID-19 gives a much more vital perspective on the discussion at hand. ACE2 is a surface membrane protein that acts as an obligatory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and facilitates its entry into the host cell (Hoffmann et al., 2020). In addition to serving as a receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 virus, ACE2 also acts as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and facilitates amino acid transport in the intestine (Gheblawi et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020). Various experiments conducted on rodent models give insight into the sites of ACE2 expression. ACE2 is expressed mainly in the lungs, intestine, brain, liver, heart, kidney, and testes. In the brain, it is expressed in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes and the sites of ACE2 expression in the brain include ventricles, hippocampus, hypothalamus, substantia nigra, middle temporal gyrus, pontine nuclei viz. pre-Bötzinger complex and nucleus of tractus solitarius and in the olfactory bulb (Gheblawi et al., 2020). More importantly, ACE2 is highly expressed in the key components of the blood-brain barrier viz. astrocytes, astrocytic foot processes, pericytes, and endothelial cells (Hernández et al., 2021).",
            "A recent study conducted using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived neural cells found ACE2 expression in young neurons and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (Kase & Okano, 2020). The tissues and organs that are the major target sites for SARS-CoV-2 are those which has higher expression of ACE2 (Pagliaro & Penna, 2020). Similar to SARS-CoV, binding of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 causes downregulation of ACE2 (Datta et al., 2020; Seltzer, 2020; Tang et al., 2021; Triana et al., 2021). This downregulation of ACE2 will cause dysregulation of RAS and other complications in addition to its direct effects. Out of the many physiological functions of ACE2, its neuroprotective role is of prime importance to this discussion. Pre-clinical experiments conducted in animal models show the diverse neuroprotective function of ACE2. In an Alzheimer’s disease rodent model, Diminazene, an ACE2 activator was found to increase CREB, BDNF, and nicotinic receptors while reducing apoptotic and inflammatory proteins which all play a major role in adult neurogenesis (Kamel et al., 2018). In transgenic mice, neurotoxic amyloid protein Aβ43 is converted to a neuroprotective form Aβ40 by ACE2 (Liu et al., 2014). ACE2 deficient mice exhibited impaired memory and learning, and abolition of exercise-induced adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Klempin et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2016).",
            "ACE2 is involved in the intestinal neutral amino acid transport via the neutral amino acid transporter BoAT1. ACE2/BoAT1 complex regulates the gut microbiota composition and function. ACE2 knock-out animals presented with impaired gut microbiota composition (Hashimoto et al., 2012). SARS-CoV-2 entry into the enteric host cells leads to ACE2 shedding by S priming which may lead to gut microbiota dysbiosis (He et al., 2020; Viana, Nunes & Reis, 2020). There is an increase in interest among the researchers regarding a potential link between gut microbiota and the development of neuropsychiatric disorders linked to impaired adult neurogenesis like anxiety and depression (Peirce & Alviña, 2019). Prolonged antibiotic treatment-induced depletion of gut microbiota in adult mice caused an impairment in adult neurogenesis and cognitive function (Möhle et al., 2016). Thus, gut microbiota dysbiosis could be another way through which ACE2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to impaired adult neurogenesis.",
            "ACE2 is involved in the intestinal absorption of tryptophan, the precursor of serotonin which plays a major role in adult neurogenesis and is implicated in psychiatric illness like anxiety and depression. Downregulation of ACE2 reduces serotonin levels in brain thereby affecting adult neurogenesis (Klempin et al., 2013).",
            "Hence, based on the above-mentioned factors, COVID-19 may have a potential impact on adult neurogenesis which could be implicated in the neuropsychiatric symptoms/disorders in COVID-19 survivors. The current review is speculative and relied on thorough literature review discusses the possible implication of potentially impaired adult neurogenesis in neuropsychiatric symptoms/disorders in PACS with emphasis on the role of neuroinflammation.",
            "It has been elucidated recently that prolonged inflammation caused by a release of pro-inflammatory cytokines can cause some neurological deficits and cognitive dysfunction during the post-acute phase of COVID-19 (Maltezou, Pavli & Tsakris, 2021). Recent studies point towards the persistence of neuroinflammation in patients 3 months after recovery from COVID-19 which emphasize the link to the neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 in PACS (Goldberg et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2020). A recent study by Serrano-Castro et al. (2022) found that the chemokine and growth factor profile of COVID-19 patients, 3 months after discharge depicted a persistent neuroinflammatory state.",
            "Researchers across the globe use different small and large animal models to study COVID-19 and PACS regarding host response, transmission, pathogenesis, and therapeutic strategies. The World Health Organization (WHO) has assembled WHO-COM (WHO COVID-19 modelling), an international panel to develop and study new animal models for COVID-19 research. Readers can refer to the review by Muñoz-Fontela et al. (2020) for information regarding animal models used in COVID-19 research. Various viral infections were found to affect hippocampal functioning including neurogenesis, protein and neurotrophin expression, neuron morphology and function (Bobermin et al., 2020; Francesca et al., 2006; Hosseini et al., 2018; Li Puma et al., 2019; von Rüden et al., 2012). SARS-CoV virus-infected C57/BL6 mice model showed that viral RNA and the live virus could be isolated from the brain of infected mice which was mainly localized in the hippocampus (Glass et al., 2004). A recent study by Klein et al. (2021) found that SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters and a post-mortem study of brains of patients deceased from COVID-19 showed disruption in BBB, activation of microglia and, increased expression of brain-derived IL-1β and IL-6 in the hippocampus and lower medulla. The study also concluded that the persistence of neurological problems as noted in PACS could be mediated due to neuroinflammation affecting neural vasculature, neurotransmission and neurogenesis (Klein et al., 2021).",
            "Neuroimaging studies in live patients (Chiveri et al., 2021; Moriguchi et al., 2020) and post-mortem brain studies (Fabbri et al., 2021; Solomon et al., 2020; Thakur et al., 2021) have shown neuropathogenic changes in the hippocampus caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the implication of hippocampal pathology in various neuropsychiatric disorders, SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuropathogenic changes in the hippocampus could be attributed to neuropsychiatric disorders like depression in PACS (Nestler et al., 2002; Roddy & O’Keane, 2019; Roddy et al., 2019). SARS-CoV-2 induced potential impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis could very well be one of the underlying cellular mechanisms behind neuropsychiatric symptoms/disorders in COVID-19 survivors. Future studies to elucidate the role of SARS-CoV-2-induced neuroinflammation and a possible impairment in adult neurogenesis in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders are much needed.",
            "Earlier studies have shown that the hippocampus is highly susceptible to the effects of neuroinflammation (Barrientos et al., 2015; Hueston et al., 2018). The expression of IL-1β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is an important mediator of neuroinflammation, and its receptor are at high levels in the hippocampus (Ban et al., 1991; Parnet et al., 1994). Acute exposure to IL-1β disrupts adult hippocampal neurogenesis and contributes to cognitive and memory impairments in stress-related psychiatric disorders (McPherson, Aoyama & Harry, 2011; Ryan et al., 2013). Chronic exposure to IL-1β causes impairment in adult hippocampal neurogenesis which affects hippocampal-dependent processes like pattern separation (Hueston et al., 2018). There are different mechanisms by which neuroinflammation affects adult neurogenesis as discussed below (Fig. 3).",
            "The entry of SARS-COV-2 virus into the brain triggers the release of proinflammatory cytokines which may potentially affect the hippocampal neurogenesis. This could be possibly hypothesized as the reason for the various neuropsychiatric symptoms that are present during PACS.",
            "In normal physiological conditions, the neuroglial pathways and network operate to maintain neuronal health and circuitry. In the case of chronic inflammatory conditions, there occurs an imbalance in the cytokines in the microenvironment which activates neurodegenerative pathways (Yap et al., 2021; Zhang, Zhang & You, 2018). One of the ubiquitous element of neuroinflammation is the activation of astrocytes and microglia (Glass et al., 2010; Tjalkens, Popichak & Kirkley, 2017). They affect neurogenesis by the secretion of inflammatory mediators.",
            "Microglia secretes the growth factors, brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1) which play a key role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Nakajima et al., 2001; Suh et al., 2013). Experimental evidence shows that these factors are expressed in the regions of SGZ and hippocampus during adulthood, though found to be decreased initially after birth (Dyer et al., 2016; García-Segura et al., 1991; Mori, Shimizu & Hayashi, 2004). Inhibition of neural progenitor cell proliferation and reduction in the thickness of granule cells was noted in BDNF receptor, TrkB knockout mouse (Galvão, Garcia-Verdugo & Alvarez-Buylla, 2008). IGF-1 promotes neural precursor cell (NPC) proliferation, differentiation as well as survival probably by anti-apoptotic effects (Åberg et al., 2003). It was found that voluntary exercise increased neurogenesis by increasing the proportion of microglia that expresses BDNF and IGF-1 (Kohman et al., 2012; Littlefield et al., 2015). Short-term signaling of these neurotrophic factors viz., BDNF, and IGF, mediates cellular plasticity needed for learning and memory, whereas long-term signalling leads to neurogenesis (Duman, 2004).",
            "Microglia are similar to macrophages and are primarily responsible for maintaining brain homeostasis and response to injury (Block, Zecca & Hong, 2007). Activated microglia become ameboid-shaped and express ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2) (Singh, Bansal & Feschotte, 2020). A recent study has shown that microglia are directly infected by the SARS-COV-2 virus and can cause self-apoptosis, thereby causing a reduction in the number of microglia which leads to further infiltration of the virus (Jeong et al., 2022). Secondly, infection with SARS-COV-2 significantly increased the level of TNF-α and IL-6, suggesting that activated microglia lead to neuroinflammation (Jeong et al., 2022). A Post-mortem study of brains of patients deceased from COVID-19 showed neuropathological signs of microglial activation (Matschke et al., 2020). A study by Huang et al. (2020) showed that plasma levels of pro-inflammatory markers including different types of IL, FGF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and VEGF were increased in severe COVID-19 patients who needed admission to intensive care unit. It could be hypothesized that the release of these inflammatory cytokines by activated microglia could lead to the breakage of BBB precipitating various neurological signs and deficits in COVID-19 infected patients (Vargas et al., 2020). Very recently, a “two-hit” hypothesis of activation of microglia has been proposed, which could explain the vulnerability of certain groups (aging, co-morbidity, poor diet) for severe COVID-19 infection and prolonged sickness behavior (Bouayed & Bohn, 2021).",
            "In 2002, Song, Stevens & Gage (2002) discovered that in adult rats, astrocytes promote neural precursor cell differentiation to neurons in the hippocampus but not in the spinal cord. BDNF, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factors (GDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) are the neurogenic growth factors secreted by astrocytes (Araki, Ikegaya & Koyama, 2021). Astrocytic BDNF acts on the post synaptic cells of the hippocampus and stimulates neurogenesis. Such activity was found to alleviate anxiety-like symptoms in experimental mice (Quesseveur et al., 2013). Acute stress potentiates hippocampal neurogenesis that was mediated through astrocyte secreted FGF-2 and neutralizing FGF-2 prevented the proliferation of NPCs in cultures (Kirby et al., 2013). Dexmedetomidine was found to mediate neurogenesis in Dentate gyrus (DG), by upregulating the expression of GDNF derived from astrocytes, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) by improving astrogenesis (Zhang et al., 2019). In a recent study, it was found that enhanced VEGF promoted neurogenesis by transdifferentiation of astrocytes to neurons and such effects were abolished after treatment with Flurocitrate which is an astrocyte inhibitor in the striatum of the ischemic stroke model (Shen et al., 2016).",
            "Owing to the importance of astrocytes in the formation of BBB, it could be postulated that infection of astrocytes with SARS-COV-2 virus could compromise the integrity of BBB (DeOre et al., 2021). Previously, compromise in BBB, and neuroinflammation have been implicated in various neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders caused due to several types of Viral infections (Palus et al., 2017; Persidsky et al., 2000; Verma et al., 2010). Conversely, disrupted BBB could in turn activate astrocyte and microglial cells as an innate immune response (Alquisiras-Burgos et al., 2021). Elevated levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were noted in COVID-19 patients which is a marker for astrogliosis (Heimfarth et al., 2022). As astrocytes are principal producers of cytokines and chemokines in natural immune response, it could be held that they can cause neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity after infection (Tavčar et al., 2021) and also serve as a host for viral replication (Crunfli et al., 2021). A post-mortem study conducted on the brains of COVID-19 patients showed astrocytes to be the major site of infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 (Crunfli et al., 2021).",
            "The pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain are mainly produced by activated microglia (Wang & Jin, 2015). Depending on the physiological state, the action of cytokines in the regulation of adult neurogenesis varies. Under physiological conditions, IL-6 and TNF-α activate neurotrophic factors and promote neuroregeneration and IL-2 participates in BDNF signaling and hippocampal functioning. However, in a proinflammatory environment, the action of these cytokines leans more towards neurodegeneration and is implicated in the pathogenesis of neuropsychological disorders (Baune et al., 2012; Beck et al., 2005; Eker et al., 2014; Murphy et al., 2000). Chronic neuroinflammation directly impairs adult hippocampal neurogenesis though there are controversial results (Fan & Pang, 2017). Proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-α causes a reduction in neural cell proliferation and suppresses adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Borsini et al., 2017; Borsini et al., 2018; Koo & Duman, 2008). TNF-α has a dual effect on adult neurogenesis in vivo. TNFR1 receptor activation causes suppression of neurogenesis while TNFR2 activation favors neurogenesis. I. vitro effect of TNF-α was predominantly suppressive to adult neurogenesis (Chen & Palmer, 2013). A dose-dependent inhibition of adult neurogenesis was produced by overexpression of IL-1β (Wu et al., 2012). Nuclear factor-Kβ signaling is found to be the mediator for the anti-neurogenic effect of IL-1β (Koo et al., 2010). Chronic expression of IL-1β in DG both in vitro and in vivo resulted in a reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis (Mathieu et al., 2010). IL-6 is considered to be the pivotal xcytokine that inhibits adult neurogenesis (Wang & Jin, 2015). IL-6 impairs neurogenesis by promoting NPCs towards gliogenesis (Vallieres et al., 2002). Chronic overexpression of IL-6 in astroglia causes a significant reduction in new neuron production without affecting gliogenesis (Vallieres et al., 2002). Neural stem cells exposed to IL-6 and TNF-α exhibited a marked reduction in neurogenesis (Monje, Toda & Palmer, 2003). There is conflicting evidence on the in vitro effect of IFN-γ on adult neurogenesis (Wang & Jin, 2015). However, in vivo studies show insignificant neurogenesis suppressing effect by IFN-γ (Monje, Toda & Palmer, 2003).",
            "Neurotrophic factors like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), nerve growth factor (NGF), glia-derived nerve factor (GDNF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) play a key role in the regulation of adult neurogenesis (Saikarthik, Saraswathi & Al-Atram, 2021).",
            "There exists an inverse relationship between BDNF and pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-2, TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-1β in pro-inflammatory states (Yap et al., 2021). IL-1β was shown to inhibit the neuronal expression of BDNF in the presence of glial cells (Rage, Silhol & Tapia-Arancibia, 2006). Inflammatory cytokines interfere with BDNF signaling by influencing TrkB phosphorylation (Cortese et al., 2011). Administration of IFN-α causes a reduction in BDNF levels (Lotrich, Albusaysi & Ferrell, 2013). Chronic neuroinflammation causes a reduction in the microglial release of neurotrophic factors like IGF-1, thereby causing neurodegeneration (Labandeira-Garcia et al., 2017; Suh et al., 2013). TNF-α inhibits IGF-1 signalling in neurons (Venters et al., 1999).",
            "Serum BDNF levels were found to be decreased in COVID-19-positive patients and were found to be restored during recovery (Azoulay et al., 2020). No significant difference was noted in the levels of IGF between COVID-19 positive and normal patients. However increased levels of IGF were associated with hypertension, neurogenic disease and shock which were noted in severe cases of COVID-19 (Feizollahi et al., 2022). Thus, the role of BDNF and IGF is found to be, and hence further studies are necessary to study the effect of these neurotrophic factors on neurogenesis in the post-acute COVID-19 phase.",
            "A wide range of actions on adult neurogenesis is demonstrated by anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-10 that are released during neuroinflammation promote neurogenesis. In COVID-19, IL-10 levels are increased which promotes neuronal migration (Butovsky et al., 2006; Lorkiewicz & Waszkiewicz, 2021). Increased expression of TGF-β was observed in COVID-19 patients which has pro-neurogenic effects (Samsami et al., 2022; Xiong et al., 2020). Chronic expression of TGF-β improves adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Mathieu, Piantanida & Pitossi, 2010). A recent study found that chemokines viz. stromal cell-derived factor–1 (SDF-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels to be higher in COVID-19 patients 3 months after their hospital discharge (Serrano-Castro et al., 2022). They are released by astrocytes and their levels are upregulated during neuroinflammatory states. The receptors of SDF-1a, an isoform of SDF-1 viz. CXCR4 and CXCR7 and the receptor for MCP-1, CCR2 are highly expressed in NSCs (Ni et al., 2004; Peng et al., 2004; Widera et al., 2004). Both these chemokines play a major role in the migration of NSCs during neurogenesis. They also were shown to play a positive role in neuronal proliferation and differentiation (Lee et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2009). Mildly symptomatic and severe cases of COVID-19 presented with higher levels of fractalkine (Khalil, Elemam & Maghazachi, 2021). Neuronal CX3CL-1 (fractalkine)/CX3CR1 signalling has a regulatory role in adult neurogenesis with disruption in the signalling causing decreased survival and proliferation of NPCs in rodent model (Bachstetter et al., 2011). CCL11 (eotaxin-1) which acts through receptor CCR3 was found to be increased in the earlier phase of COVID-19 and its levels remained steady post infection (Khalil, Elemam & Maghazachi, 2021). Increased levels of peripheral CCL11 decreased adult neurogenesis and affected learning and memory in animal model (Villeda et al., 2011). A predominantly positive impact of neuroinflammation on adult neurogenesis is exhibited through anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.",
            "From the above discussion, we could postulate that neuroinflammation in PACS has the potential to cause alterations in adult neurogenesis. COVID-19 worsens pre-existing neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions like major depressive disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease in addition to causing new such conditions. Some of the features of PACS including depression, memory loss, and cognitive disorder has been associated with impaired adult neurogenesis. With neuroinflammation having both beneficial and detrimental effects on neurogenesis, based on the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PACS, the detrimental effects seem to outweigh the beneficial ones. Hence, impairment in adult neurogenesis can be a potential cause for the neuropsychiatric symptoms/disorders in PACS. However, preclinical studies to specifically analyze adult neurogenesis in SARS-CoV-2 infection are crucial. A better comprehension of the process of adult neurogenesis in PACS may help elucidate the potential role of the regenerative capacity of neural precursor cells and adult neurogenesis in battling the neuropsychiatric symptoms/disorders in PACS. Targeted therapeutic strategies to manage neuroinflammation and impaired adult neurogenesis are the need of the hour to prevent the development of neurological complications of PACS.",

            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is known as a respiratory virus, but SARS-CoV-2 appears equally, or even more, infectious for the olfactory epithelium (OE) than for the respiratory epithelium in the nasal cavity. In light of the small area of the OE relative to the respiratory epithelium, the high prevalence of olfactory dysfunctions (ODs) in COVID-19 has been bewildering and has attracted much attention. This review aims to first examine the cytological and molecular biological characteristics of the OE, especially the microvillous apical surfaces of sustentacular cells and the abundant SARS-CoV-2 receptor molecules thereof, that may underlie the high susceptibility of this neuroepithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection and damages. The possibility of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, or the lack of it, is then analyzed with regard to the expression of the receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) or priming protease (transmembrane serine protease 2), and cellular targets of infection. Neuropathology of COVID-19 in the OE, olfactory bulb, and other related neural structures are also reviewed. Toward the end, we present our perspectives regarding possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis and ODs, in the absence of substantial viral infection of neurons. Plausible causes for persistent ODs in some COVID-19 convalescents are also examined.",
            "Apart from causing respiratory, cardiovascular, and systemic problems, COVID-19 is also accompanied by frequent neurological manifestations such as headache, dizziness, anosmia, ageusia, or even stroke [1,2,3,4,5]. Among others, COVID-19-related olfactory dysfunctions (ODs), as represented by anosmia or hyposmia, are highly relevant to upper respiratory infection, as these dysfunctions imply infection and pathology of the olfactory epithelium (OE) lining the superior recess of the nasal cavity. It is thus not surprising that COVID-19 related ODs have attracted much attention from both the clinical and basic medicine research communities [6,7,8,9,10].",
            "ODs are quite common in disorders of the nose. The causes of ODs vary from nasal congestion, OE inflammation, infection or damage, or structural functional abnormalities of the olfactory nerve, olfactory bulb (OB), or other central nervous system (CNS) structures. However, the ODs in COVID-19 seem somehow special in that these deficits are unusually prevalent, sometimes appear before other symptoms, and, on occasions, might even be the only symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection without apparent nasal congestion or inflammation. The incidence of smell and/or taste impairment in COVID-19 patients varied from as low as 5% to as high as 98% in the literature, depending on areas, populations, SARS-CoV-2 variants, and methods of diagnosis, but most analyses have reported an OD rate of 20–80% [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21]. Although a majority of COVID-19-related ODs disappear in a few weeks, the deficits in some patients could persist long after resolution of other COVID-19 abnormalities [22,23,24,25].",
            "The questions then arise as to the reasons for the unusually high prevalence of ODs in COVID-19, the possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 invasion or infliction of acute and chronic damages to the peripheral or central olfactory system, and the prospects of olfaction recovery in the cases of protracted post-COVID-19 ODs. There have been many reports, experiments, or speculations with regard to COVID-19-related ODs within the short time period since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, one often contradicting the other. Here, we attempt to first discuss possible molecular and cytological substrates for high susceptibility of the OE to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism (or the lack of it) and COVID-19 neuropathology will then be analyzed. In view of the scarce neurotropism of the virus, plausible mechanisms of COVID-19 neuropathogenesis and ODs are explored, such as neural support deprivation, inflammation, immune reactions at the OE, anterograde degeneration or molecular trafficking along nerve fibers, and microvascular thrombosis in the OB or other CNS regions. Possible causes of protracted ODs after COVID-19 are also briefly reviewed.",
            "The sense of smell (olfaction) starts from the binding of airborne odor molecules (odorants) to their receptors on the surface of the OE at the superior part of the nasal cavity. Here, chemical characteristics of the odorants are encoded into electrical signals, and then transmitted monosynaptically through the olfactory nerves (cranial nerves I) to the OB. After relay and integration there, the olfactory impulses are further transmitted to higher order olfactory regions of the CNS for olfactory perception, reactions, memory, and other neural processes [26,27].",
            "The OE lines the superior vault of the nasal cavity. Its location near the entrance of the upper respiratory tract facilitates early detection of important or potentially harmful odorants in the inhaled air, but this frontline positioning of the special sense receptor organ also renders the OE vulnerable to pathogens or damages in the upper respiratory tract [28,29]. Histologically, the OE is a layer of pseudostratified columnar epithelium, as is the respiratory epithelium (RE) lining most other parts of the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses. At the cytological level, however, the OE and RE differ significantly from each other. Specifically, the OE is made of ciliated olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), sustentacular supporting cells, globose and horizontal basal cells, occasional microvillar cells and ductal cells of Bowman’s glands, plus glandular cells of Bowman’s glands in the lamina propria of the olfactory mucosa [28,30,31]. The sustentacular and microvillar cell nuclei usually occupy a more apical position of the OE; ORN cell bodies are mostly located in the middle layer, whereas basal cells are found next to or close to the basement membrane. The nasal RE, however, is a ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium made of ciliated and non-ciliated columnar epithelial cells, secretory goblet cells, basal cells, occasional brush cells, small granule cells, and ductal cells of glands, plus glandular cells in the lamina propria [32].",
            "The bipolar ORNs are directly exposed, at the dendritic knob and cilia, to the nasal mucus and nasal cavity environment. While the direct interaction with the inhaled air enables a high sensitivity to odorants in the immediate environment, the direct contact with nasal mucus and air subjects the ORNs to the risk of potential harm by detrimental molecules or microorganisms that are breathed in and out of the nasal cavity. Probably because of this vulnerability, the ORNs have a relatively short lifespan of only a few weeks and are constantly replaced by new receptor neurons generated from OE basal cells [28,33].",
            "At the axonal end, the ORNs are monosynaptically connected with neurons of the olfactory bulb of the CNS [27,28]. The olfactory nerve not only conducts olfactory nerve impulses to the olfactory bulb but may also serve as a trafficking pathway for certain intrinsic or extrinsic molecules, toxins, or viruses along the axoplasm from the OE to the OB, or vice versa. As compared with trafficking through the blood stream and blood–brain barrier, the olfactory nerve represents an alternative and more direct route of CNS vulnerability to infections/toxicities of nasal origin [34,35,36,37]. The direct neural pathway and its trafficking capability are sometimes also used for delivering therapeutics or other molecules to the CNS, to bypass the blood–brain barrier [38,39,40,41,42].",
            "In terms of luminal surface area, the OE accounts for only about 5% of the total nasal epithelium in humans [7,43,44], but ODs (anosmia, hyposmia, etc.) have been reported in up to about 80% of COVID-19 patients, and ODs are sometimes the first or only clinical manifestation of the infection [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21]. Sudden anosmia has been reported to be even more predictive of SARS-CoV-2 infection than any other symptoms, including fever, cough, hoarse voice, or shortness of breath [45].",
            "The disproportionately high prevalence and specificity of ODs suggest high susceptibility of the OE to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Why is this so? There is no definitive answer to the question yet, but difference in expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor) has been well noted between the OE and RE. There have been reports of more abundant ACE2 expression in the OE (up to hundreds of times more in immunofluorescence intensity, as quantified by laser scanning confocal microscopy) than in the neighboring nasal RE [46,47,48] (see below for further details concerning ACE2 expression in specific cell types of the OE, RE, and some other tissues). Besides, structurally, the OE luminal surface is mostly occupied by thin and long microvilli that are rooted from the apical surface of olfactory sustentacular cells. This coat of microvilli could effectively increase dozens-fold to hundred-fold the apical surface area of OE sustentacular cells (Figure 1). In contrast, few cells of the nasal RE bear apical microvilli. Even though the motile apical cilia of respiratory epithelial cells could also multiply the surface area, this cilia mechanism might not effectively serve the purpose for increased viral binding. Coordinated cilia motility actually propels out pathogens, particles, and cell debris to clean up the airway [49,50]. Cellular microvilli, in contrast, are well known for functional roles to increase cellular surface area for binding or absorption [51]. The possibility of OE sustentacular cell microvilli as an effective areal multiplier for binding SARS-CoV-2 is further supported by the presence here of ACE2 receptor for the virus (see below), although it awaits future experimental evidence to verify this notion specifically.",
            "Various molecules or viruses can preferentially bind to and enter neuronal cells, migrate along neuronal axoplasm, and are thus neurotropic. Some neurotropic molecules are of intrinsic origins from the nervous system or other parts of the body (such as NGF, BDNF, and NT-3) [37]. Other neurotropic molecules are of extrinsic origins, including bacterial or fungal toxins (such as cholera toxin, tetanus toxin, and botulinum neurotoxin) and lectins (such as wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PhA-L)) [35,55,56,57,58]. A number of viruses, including the herpes simplex viruses, poliovirus, rabies virus, and bovine herpesvirus 5 (BHV5), are also neurotropic [34,36,59,60,61]. A majority of these neurotropic molecules/viruses have designated binding receptors identified on neuronal cells, and thus could enter neurons through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Many of them can also be transported anterogradely or retrogradely along the neuronal processes (mostly axons) or neural pathways. A few are even capable of travelling transsynaptically (transneuronally) from one neuron to other neurons or effector cells through synaptic connections. The anterograde, retrograde, and transsynaptic trafficking properties of some neurotropic molecules (such as WGA, PHA-L, cholera toxin) or viruses (such as HSV) have been exploited for tracing neuronal connections in the nervous system [58,62,63,64,65].",
            "A few groups examined the expression of ACE2 (the SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2, the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry-priming protease) to assess possible tropism of the virus to specific tissues and cell types [66,67]. To that end, approaches such as single-cell RNA-sequencing, immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization histochemistry have been employed. The results still somehow vary, but basic expression patterns in the OE, RE, and elsewhere have emerged. In both human and mouse OE, ACE2 immunoreactivity has been found mainly on the sustentacular cells, especially at the supranuclear part, apical surface, and microvilli of sustentacular cells. To a variable extent, ACE2 could also be seen on OE basal cells, ductal and glandular cells of Bowman’s glands. Minimal or no ACE2 was detected on mature ORNs. TMPRSS2 exhibited a cell-type expression pattern similar to ACE2, albeit less cell type-specific [46,47,48,68]. In human nasal RE, ACE2 has been detected in ciliated columnar respiratory epithelial cells, but not in the secretory goblet cells [69]. Another study, in contrast, found ACE2 on RE secretory cells [47].",
            "In the CNS, including the olfactory bulb, most studies have observed significant ACE2 in brain vasculature, but no or little ACE2 in neurons or glia [68,70,71]. ACE2 was found on vascular endothelial cells and on pericytes of capillaries. TMPRSS2 transcripts were barely detected in the mouse CNS [46]. One group, however, reported expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in astrocytes and microglia, in addition to brain vascular endothelial cells and pericytes [72].",
            "Many groups have examined SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or pathology in various cells, tissues, and organ systems in human autopsy or biopsy samples, and in infected model animals such as the nonhuman primates, golden Syrian hamster, ferret, and hACE2 transgenic mouse. Here, we briefly examine the data related to the nervous system, especially the OE and OB. In COVID-19 human autopsy, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was detected in many OE sustentacular cells and RE epithelial cells, and occasionally in probable progenitor ORNs positive for Olig2 [73]. Olfactory mucosa showed the highest SARS-CoV-2 viral load as compared to the oral mucosa, cornea, conjunctiva, olfactory bulb, olfactory tubercle, trigeminal ganglion, medulla oblongata, and cerebellum [74]. Another recent study identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in brush biopsy from the OE of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was found mainly in sustentacular cells and immune cells. Occasional ORN infections were seen, but the number seemed insignificant compared to the uninfected control group [23]. In terms of pathology, human COVID-19 autopsies revealed focal atrophy, white blood cell infiltration in the olfactory mucosa, ORN axon damage, and inflammatory neuropathy of the olfactory nerve [74,75]. Strong cleaved caspase-3 signals indicative of cell apoptosis have also been observed in both infected and noninfected cells in the olfactory mucosa of anosmic COVID-19 patients [23]. Biopsy in a case of persistent anosmia 3 months after COVID-19 infection found massive disruption and desquamation of olfactory epithelium [22].",
            "In golden Syrian hamster, massive OE damage and immune reactions were seen after nasal instillation of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in desquamation of the OE and infiltration of immune cells. A large number of sustentacular cells were infected. ORNs showed loss of cilia, but little or no evidence of viral infection [76,77,78,79]. In other studies, infection of some basal cells and occasional ORNs could not be ruled out [23,77]. In keeping with the findings from human autopsy and golden Syrian hamster model, SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets also showed virus positivity in OE sustentacular cells and nasal respiratory epithelial cells [80].",
            "Possible infection and pathology of other PNS structures in COVID-19 remain largely unexplored. The pathology of ageusia, for example, seems mostly unknown, although viral load in saliva has been found correlated with COVID-19 symptoms and loss of taste [81]. ACE2 was low or absent in taste receptor cells [7,82]. Noticeably, however, SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein has been detected in subsets of autopsy cranial nerves originating from the lower brainstem [83]. Diffused low ACE2 expression has been reported in some dorsal root ganglion neurons [84]. SARS-CoV-2 was rarely detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of COVID-19 patients, including those with severe neurological manifestations or complications, but inflammatory or immunoreactive alterations seem common [9,85,86,87,88,89,90].",
            "Regarding the CNS, brain autopsies in COVID-19 have generally revealed no SARS-CoV-2 in neurons or glia. PCR assays had found viral RNA in some brain tissue lysates, probably from virions or viral RNAs in infected blood or blood vessels of the brain [3,91,92,93]. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was detected in vascular endothelial cells and in microthrombi in COVID-19 brain autopsy samples including the OB, cerebellum, and brainstem [74]. Another autopsy study revealed occasional presence of viral N- or S-protein in individual cells of unknown identity in the CNS but found no direct relation of the cellular infection to major CNS pathological changes [83]. Pathological findings from COVID-19 autopsies include extensive inflammation, microglia activation, astrogliosis (especially in OB and medulla oblongata), perivascular infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes or leukocytes, intravascular microthrombi [74,75,83,92], and hypoxia-associated alterations [93]. Brain imaging abnormalities, indicative of edema, injury, and microbleeding, have also been reported in the olfactory bulb of COVID-19 patients [94,95,96].",
            "In experimental animals, irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the RE and OE, there has been no report of substantial invasion of the virus into the CNS neurons or glia (including the OB) [10,76,77,78,79,80,97,98,99], with a few exceptions (see below). SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein-positive myeloid cells were occasionally observed in the OB, but the exact identity (blood monocytes, macrophages, or CNS microglia) and locations (intravascular or extravascular) of these cells remained uncertain [23]. Likewise, although mostly undetectable in neurons or glia in the brain (including the OB), SARS-CoV-2 could sometimes be recovered from brain samples of infected animals, probably from infected blood or vascular endothelial cells [23,78]. Neuropathological alterations after SARS-CoV-2 infection of susceptible experimental animals ranged from absence of clear changes to inflammation, microglia activation, and infiltration of macrophages, similar to autopsy findings in human COVID-19 [76,77]. One exception is the K18-hACE2 transgenic mice that overexpress human ACE2 transgene (hACE2) under human K-18 promotor control and display unusually high sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal infection of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice could result in not only viral invasion of the OE, RE, and lungs, but also extensive virus spread into CNS regions such as the OB, anterior olfactory nucleus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and cerebral cortices [100,101]. In contrast, another line of transgenic mice that overexpresses hACE2 under the mouse ACE2 promotor control also suffers from SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease but did not show prominent virus spread to the CNS [102]. Even though seemingly unrepresentative, the K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model appears suitable for therapeutic screening, as evidenced by the effectiveness of COVID-19 convalescent antisera in preventing disease or mortality by SARS-CoV-2 in these mice [101].",
            "In summary, SARS-CoV-2 at the OE mainly infects the olfactory sustentacular cells (Figure 2A,B). Although OE horizontal basal cells have been shown to express moderate ACE2, these cells are normally not exposed to the nasal cavity and mucus, and thus might contract the virus only under special circumstances, such as compromise in OE integrity or secondary infection. OE desquamation, disruption, cell death, ORN cilia loss, and other pathological changes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, affect both ORNs and non-neuronal OE cells. Then, how are the mainly sustentacular cell infection and damages translated into ORN dysfunctions and OE pathology?",
            "First, SARS-CoV-2-elicited sustentacular cell damages or death would compromise OE structural integrity, and significantly deprive the ORNs of the usual supports from non-neuronal, especially sustentacular, cells for structural stability, metabolism, homeostasis, and olfactory functions. The loss of supports might cause ORN injuries or even cell deaths. In case of infection and destruction of Bowman’s glands or ducts, OE mucus secretion would be adversely affected, and possible infection of OE basal cells or precursor ORNs may also hinder regeneration and functional recovery of the OE [31,103,104,105,106,107,108].",
            "More importantly, infection of the OE would presumably mobilize immune reactions and activate inflammation as well as the release of specific cytokines or chemokines at the olfactory mucosa that could variably affect ORNs and other OE cells structurally or functionally. OE sustentacular cells are also phagocytic [105]. OE microvillar cells expressing transient receptor potential channel TRPM5 might have a role in neuroimmune detection or reactions [109]. A recent study has further demonstrated an ORN-mediated TrkA-dependent ultrarapid immune response to intranasal viral infection and OE damage in the rainbow trout [110]. Selective upregulation of interferon in the OE inhibits ORN odorant receptor protein expression and induces anosmia even without overt damage to the OE [111]. OE biopsy of COVID-19 patients showed significant increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) but not IL-1β, as compared to levels in uninfected controls [112]. Transgenic overexpression of TNF-α is known to promote ORN cell death [6,113]. Interleukin 17c (IL17c) and its receptor are present in the mouse olfactory mucosa, and the former is markedly upregulated upon poly I:C intranasal instillation, mimicking viral infection [114].",
            "Based on previous studies, it is also likely that pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and related damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) play important roles in pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in the OE and RE. PAMPs and DAMPs are involved in epithelial innate immunity and in pathogenesis of many acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. The single-pass transmembranous Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a type of PRRs, for example, recognize specific PAMPs, play important roles in innate immune reactions, and are expressed by neurons and glia of both the CNS and PNS [115]. TLR3, which detects double-stranded RNAs and activates NF-κB, has been shown to be preferentially expressed in mouse OE sustentacular cells [116]. Intranasal infusion of PAMPs and related mimetic molecules to activate TLRs would evoke neuroimmune or inflammatory responses [6,117,118], or protection of the OE from subsequent infection and the CNS from virus invasion [119]. It awaits future investigations to elucidate the involvement details of PRRs, PAMPs, and DAMPs in COVID-19-related olfactory dysfunctions and neuropathology.",
            "In COVID-19 cases with obvious nasal congestion and rhinitis, obstructed airflow through the nasal cavity would also adversely affect olfaction and exacerbate ODs.",
            "The microglia activation, astrogliosis, inflammation, and immune reactions in the OB and related CNS regions after OE SARS-CoV-2 infection appear mostly elicited indirectly, rather than by the invasion of the virus itself [6,10]. One possible indirect pathogenesis pathway could be the anterograde and transsynaptic (transneuronal) degeneration of OB neural structures after damages or cell death of ORNs and olfactory nerve [120,121,122,123]. Moreover, even though axoplasmic transport of SARS-CoV-2 virus to the OB is rare, the situation seems different with regard to anterograde and transsynaptic transport of potentially pathogenic molecules and signals. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein cleavage peptide, for example, readily reaches the OB and other related CNS regions after intranasal instillation in the mice [73,124]. TLRs also participate in signaling between connected neurons in the olfactory system [119,125,126]. Finally, other CNS pathological changes, such as microvascular thrombosis, endothelium, and pericyte damages, microglia activation, and astrogliosis in the medulla oblongata, might have mainly or partially originated from the hematogenous route, and spread through the blood–brain barrier [74,75,83,92].",
            "Most COVID-19 olfactory dysfunctions are transient, lasting for about 2–3 weeks. This is consistent with the fact that the OE undergoes regular ageing and self-replacement throughout life, and often readily repairs or regenerates itself upon damages [79,127,128,129]. In defiance of this well-known healing capability of the OE, however, a significant number of COVID-19 convalescents experience persistent ODs lasting for 12 months or longer [22,23,24,25]. The absent or exceptionally retarded recovery from COVID-19 ODs in those individuals implies a more severe or lasting damage to the OE by SARS-CoV-2. More specifically, this could result from SARS-CoV-2 infection or damage of the OE basal cells that express considerable ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [22,130]. Other possible causes of prolonged ODs after COVID-19 may pertain to persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence, chronic inflammation and immune reactions, or increased cell death in the OE. In COVID-19 convalescents with persistent anosmia, inflammation (as marked by infiltration of Iba1-positive myeloid cells), increased apoptosis (as marked by cleaved caspase 3-positive cells), and presence of SARS-CoV-2 (as marked by the viral nucleoprotein) could still be detected in the OE, but not in the RE, 6 months after the initial infection [23]. Interestingly, chronic inflammation could also modulate gene expression and switch the function of OE basal cells from neural regeneration to inflammatory signaling and immune cell proliferation [131].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 has shown little neurotropism, apart from its high affinity to the neuron-supporting sustentacular cells of the OE. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes olfaction dysfunctions and ORN damages, most likely through indirect means such as deprivation of supports, inflammatory or immune reactions in the OE, and, to an extent, in the OB and other CNS regions (Figure 2B,C).",
            "Apart from possible ORN anterograde degeneration and reactions affecting the OB and related CNS regions, SARS-CoV-2 infection and assaults on endothelial cells and pericytes of CNS vessels may cause microvascular thrombosis and leucocyte infiltration that, together with microglia activation, astrogliosis, inflammation, and immune responses, add to the pathogenic mechanisms for many of the COVID-19 neurological symptoms and complications (Figure 2D).",
            "The causes and treatments of chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection of the OE and persistent post-COVID-19 ODs in a significant number of COVID-19 convalescents deserve further investigation.",

Sustentacular cell infection and damage may lead to inflammation, immune reactions, release of cytokines, and signaling through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which in turn may cause dysfunctions (such as anosmia or hyposmia) and damage and/or anterograde degeneration of olfactory receptor neuronal cells (ORNs).

            "In 2024, over 775 million cases of COVID-19 were recorded, including approximately 7 million deaths, indicating its widespread and dangerous nature. The disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can manifest a wide spectrum of symptoms, from mild infection to respiratory failure and even death. Neurological symptoms, such as headaches, confusion, and impaired consciousness, have also been reported in some COVID-19 patients. These observations suggest the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to invade the central nervous system and induce neuroinflammation during infection. This review specifically explores the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and selected neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), ischemic stroke (IS), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It has been observed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus increases the production of cytokines whose action can cause the destruction of the myelin sheaths of nerve cells. Subsequently, the body may synthesize autoantibodies that attack nerve cells, resulting in damage to the brain’s anatomical elements, potentially contributing to the onset of multiple sclerosis. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 exacerbates inflammation, worsening the clinical condition in individuals already suffering from MS. Moreover, the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines may lead to an escalation in blood clot formation, which can result in thrombosis, obstructing blood flow to the brain and precipitating an ischemic stroke. AD is characterized by intense inflammation and heightened oxidative stress, both of which are exacerbated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has been observed that the SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates enhanced cell entry in the presence of both the ACE2 receptor, which is already elevated in AD and the ApoE ε4 allele. Consequently, the condition worsens and progresses more rapidly, increasing the mortality rate among AD patients. The above information underscores the numerous connections between SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurological diseases.",
            "Coronaviruses (CoV) are a group of viruses that cause mild to severe respiratory infections in humans [1]. The first records of human coronaviruses date back to the 1960s, but in December 2019, the first cases of pneumonia caused by the newly identified coronavirus were reported in Wuhan, China [2]. In early 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described this virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing a life-threatening disease known as COVID-19. COVID-19 quickly spread around the world and on 11 March 2020, the disease was declared a global pandemic [3]. By May 2024, over 775 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported, including approximately 7 million deaths, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history [4].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a large group of pathogens affecting both humans and animals. SARS-CoV-2 is a newly mutated RNA virus that primarily infects the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems, manifesting in a wide array of symptoms [5,6]. Observational studies by e.g., Pal et al. [6], Ramzy et al. [7], and Ousseiran et al. [8] have documented clinical manifestations in patients, including fever, dyspnea, loss of smell or taste, cough, or nausea. Although the course of the disease can be asymptomatic or mild, there are severe cases that lead to systemic inflammation, cardiopulmonary arrest, or even death. The risk of organ damage and fatal complications is significantly increased in patients with comorbidities such as i.e., diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, hypertension, or obesity [6,7,8]. It has been observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection may also involve the central nervous system (CNS). Neurons and neuroglial cells susceptible to viral infections are consequently exposed to damage caused by inflammation in the CNS [9]. The virus entering the CNS can cause changes both at the level of nerve cells and in the entire brain [10]. The hypothetical mechanism linking SARS-CoV-2 infection with neurological diseases includes, among others, abnormalities in brain blood vessels and damage to the vascular endothelium, hypercoagulability, ischemia, hypoxia, inflammasome activation or the so-called cytokine storm [11,12,13].",
            "Taking the above into account, the aim of this literature review was to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection on the development of selected neurological disorders. Multiple sclerosis (MS), ischemic stroke (IS), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) share common features which involve neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, which can lead to cognitive impairment. The course of these diseases is influenced by the condition of blood vessels, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and several risk factors such as age or lifestyle. In all the above-mentioned disorders, viral infections can origin systemic and local inflammation, which is a common cause of AD (impact of HSV-1), multiple sclerosis (impact of Epstein-Barr virus), and ischemic stroke (impact of e.g., influenza viruses). Viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2 may affect the condition of the BBB and, therefore, influence the development of the aforementioned diseases. Multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, and Alzheimer’s disease are related to the occurrence of neurodegenerative processes and can be observed as a result of direct invasion of a virus via the olfactory or gustatory receptors, coagulopathy, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induction of autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. All those processes can be induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, can impair immune system function and, as a result, influence the development of these diseases.",
            "MS is an inflammatory disease of CNS characterized by neurodegenerative changes. Its etiology remains partially unknown, but it affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide, including young individuals [14,15]. The disease is influenced by genetic and environmental factors, such as Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection, reduced vitamin D levels, and cigarette smoking [16,17]. In MS, the white matter of the CNS is destroyed due to an autoimmune process [18]. There are two main hypotheses regarding the development of MS. The first autoimmune hypothesis is that autoreactive T cells move from the periphery to the brain through BBB, where they are activated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), like dendritic cells, causing inflammation. Second, the neurodegenerative hypothesis suggests that MS is primarily a neurodegenerative disease that leads to an autoimmune reaction [17]. MS can manifest in three clinical forms: Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS; ~85% of MS patients), Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS; ~10–20% of patients), and Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) [19]. Symptoms of MS vary depending on the involvement of sensory, motor, visual, and brainstem pathways. Common symptoms include optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, brainstem syndrome, and cognitive impairments [20,21]. RRMS form features periods of neurological disorders alternating with remissions, with a recurrence rate of 1.5 episodes per year. Symptoms include sensory disturbances, balance issues, and vision problems. On the other hand, PPMS is characterized by the absence of an initial relapsing phase and continuous disease progression. SPMS often develops from RRMS, with relapses and periods of stable disability. The transition from RRMS to SPMS typically takes about 19 years. Factors like older age at RRMS onset and male gender increase the risk of transition [22].",
            "Diagnosis relies on clinical symptoms, neurological examinations, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The McDonald criteria are commonly used for diagnosing MS due to the lack of a specific test [20,23,24]. It is worth emphasizing that disease-modifying therapy (DMT) is most effective for RRMS, with options like interferon type β and monoclonal antibodies such as natalizumab and daclizumab. A complete cure is not yet achievable, and the disease may progress despite treatment [25].",
            "Research indicates that EBV infection is a potential cause of MS, with other viruses possibly contributing [26]. Viral infections may lead to chronic inflammation, allowing immune cells to penetrate the CNS and cause further damage. This includes the infiltration of T lymphocytes through a damaged BBB and the release of viral products, which can stimulate an inflammatory response [27].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 is a neuroinvasive virus. The virus enters the brain through the pericytes and astrocytes of the BBB. This occurs as a result of the expression of the ACE2 receptor triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the brain endothelial cells [28]. Protein S has properties in how it controls the continuity of the BBB and triggers effects on the function of this structure [28]. The presence of the ACE2 receptor in tissues determines the cellular tropism of the virus, which attacks the CNS, resulting in neuronal damage [29]. There, as a result of the excessive synthesis of neurotoxic cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, vascular and demyelinating changes occur. Research has shown that as a result of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, glial cells produce chemokines. This leads to nerve destruction. A similar mechanism occurs in MS [30].",
            "A factor involved in the progression of MS is also mitochondrial dysfunction which may be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has been revealed that SARS-CoV-2 proteins localize to mitochondria which leads to e.g., damage and mutations in mitochondrial DNA [31]. Malfunction of these structures leads to intracellular dysregulation and a decrease in energy production. A decrease in ATP production disrupts the transmission of electrical signals. As a result of mitochondrial dysfunction, neurons are damaged [31]. Going forward, it is well known that mitochondria are a significant source of ROS, which can damage cells. Munoz-Jurado A et al. discovered that excessive production of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which have oxidizing properties, stimulates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in nerve cells such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. NF-κB affects the synthesis of MS development factors like TNF-α, nitric oxide, and IL-1α. This results in increased inflammation, demyelination, and the onset of the disease [32]. Moreover, the theoretical thesis suggests that molecular mimicry between self-antigens and viral antigens, along with a delayed immune response post-infection, are among the mechanisms linking COVID-19 with MS. Studies by Lima et al. [33] have indicated that individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and experiencing nervous system symptoms often exhibit autoantibodies against neurons or glial cells in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This phenomenon contributes to the destruction of CNS structures and potentially impacts the onset of MS [33]. On the other hand, it has been suggested that B lymphocytes are involved in the pathogenesis of MS. However, this involvement is not related to the presence of antibodies but rather to an imbalance in the production of different cytokines. B cells synthesize excessive amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and insufficient amounts of regulatory cytokines (e.g., IL-35), resulting in an abnormal pro-inflammatory response from Th1, Th17, and myeloid cells. Cellular infiltrates consisting of B cells have been detected in people with MS and the concentration of B lymphocytes, plasma blasts, and plasma cells is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients. In this study, the authors define the role of autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of MS as unknown [34]. Moreover, it is known that viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2, affect the production of interferons. Physiologically, they assist in suppressing viral replication and activating immune cells like macrophages and natural killer cells. However, it has been observed that in severe COVID-19 cases, IFN responses can be dysregulated [35]. Defective production of e.g., IFN-1 can lead to hyper inflammation aggravating the disease. Going further, in patients with MS, impairment of IFN-1 response at the genetic and transcriptional levels has been also reported [35]. Therefore, external interferons, particularly IFN-β, are employed in MS treatment to regulate the immune response and reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Thus, knowing that SARS-CoV-2 infection can interfere with IFN pathways, it appears that the virus may act as an environmental trigger for MS in susceptible individuals, contributing to the onset of the disease in genetically predisposed individuals or potentially exacerbating symptoms [35,36].",
            "COVID-19 and MS are linked to various immunological disturbances that might potentially influence each other’s progression. It has been observed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a strong inflammatory response combined with autoimmunity and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17, which is produced primarily by Th17 cells. It is worth emphasizing that IL-17 is an important cytokine in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, contributing to both virus removal and inflammation. However, enhanced synthesis of IL-17 results in, among other things, the production of coagulation factors and contributes to multi-organ failure. Unfortunately, it has been observed that IL-17 is also crucial in the development and progression of MS, as it drives the inflammatory and autoimmune responses that cause demyelination, nerve damage, and disruption of BBB. Therefore, information available in the literature suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may potentially exacerbate multiple sclerosis symptoms or influence disease progression through IL-17-mediated mechanisms [35,36].",
            "Another crucial factor at the intersection of COVID-19 and MS is the inflammasome. It is a complex molecular platform that consists of inflammatory caspases, sensor protein, and sometimes an adapter protein that connects the other two components. Abnormal inflammasome activation can be linked to infections and inflammatory diseases. Inflammasomes, particularly NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), have been significantly implicated in the development of MS. The NLRP3 plays a pivotal role in T cell polarization, BBB damage, and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to activate this platform has been observed during more severe cases of COVID-19. So, a major factor in COVID-19 pathogenesis and its severity is probably the cytokine storm linked to NLRP3 overactivation. Thus, it appears that the progression of multiple sclerosis could be significantly influenced by SARS-CoV-2 infection [35,36]. An alternative theory suggests that the inflammasome, after forming a complex with the adapter protein ASC, activates caspase-1. This activation leads to the processing and activation of IL-1β, IL-18, and gasdermin, which subsequently cause pyroptosis, i.e., the death of nervous system cells. According to the authors, the consequence of these processes may not necessarily be cell death but rather a permanent dysregulation of the inflammasome, which has a considerable impact on the speed of disease onset [27].",
            "Conversely, individuals with multiple sclerosis undergo treatments that modulate their immune systems, increasing susceptibility to viral infections [37]. The most prevalent drug used in MS treatment, rituximab, a monoclonal antibody, targets CD20 B cells to suppress the humoral response. However, despite its efficacy, rituximab poses a considerable risk of infection, rendering MS patients treated with this drug more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 [38]. Another medication that heightens the risk of COVID-19 is sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators (S1PRM) [30].",
            "Interestingly, the latest research results suggest that the development and relapses of multiple sclerosis may be influenced by stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Long-term stress affects the immune system functions and changes the secretion of dopamine in the mesolimbic system of the brain [39]. Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and increased production of cortisol in response to stress may cause the progression of MS [39]. The overall mechanism of the virus action is presented in Figure 1.",
            "To sum up, infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus influences the development of multiple sclerosis. This is related to dysregulated immune pathways that are found in severe cases of COVID-19. Studies carried out by e.g., Fernandes de Souza et al. show the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with genes for autoimmune diseases, including MS. The three main pathways are the IFN-1 response, the Th1/Th17 axis, and the inflammasome pathway. It is speculated that the negative effects of COVID-19 may be visible in the future [36]. What is more, it seems that SARS-CoV-2 has an impact on individuals with MS, particularly regarding the potential for disease exacerbation. SARS-CoV-2 can trigger an exaggerated immune response, leading to a cytokine storm. This hyperinflammatory state may exacerbate MS symptoms by enhancing existing inflammation in the CNS [30]. The virus may also influence T-cell activation and differentiation, potentially aggravating autoimmune processes in MS patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to affect the integrity of the BBB, potentially allowing more immune cells to enter the CNS and worsen MS pathology [27]. In addition, many MS patients are on immunosuppressive therapies that may increase susceptibility to infections, including COVID-19. Some DMTs might alter the course of COVID-19 or affect the severity of MS relapses during the infection [25]. It is also worth noting that older age and advanced disease stages in MS patients are associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes and possible exacerbation of MS symptoms. However, ongoing research is essential to fully understand the relationship between COVID-19 and MS and to develop interventions that address both conditions.",
            "Stroke, a cerebrovascular disorder that lasts at least 24 h, causes nerve cell damage due to decreased blood supply to the brain [40]. Strokes are categorized into ischemic and hemorrhagic types. Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel is blocked, interrupting blood flow to brain tissue, while hemorrhagic stroke involves intracranial bleeding from a vessel rupture [40,41]. Approximately 60–80% of strokes are ischemic [41,42]. Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability globally [43]. Importantly, the global stroke burden is expected to rise in the next decade [44]. Ischemic stroke is influenced by non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors. Non-modifiable factors include age, gender, ethnicity, and genetics [45]. Although strokes can occur at any age, they predominantly affect older individuals [46,47]. However, 10–15% of cases occur in young adults aged 18 to 49 [48,49]. Women are generally more susceptible to ischemic stroke than men due to factors like longer life expectancy, hormonal contraception, and pregnancy [46,47,49]. Modifiable risk factors significantly influence stroke development, with hypertension being the most notable. High blood pressure, combined with lifestyle factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, substance abuse, and inactivity, as well as conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, significantly increases stroke risk [43,47,50].",
            "Both viral and bacterial infections, particularly those affecting the respiratory tract, pose significant risk factors for cerebrovascular events [51,52]. Numerous clinical studies (i.a.Smeeth et al. [51] and Bahouth et al. [53]) have revealed an association between recent systemic infections and the occurrence of strokes. It is hypothesized that the primary pathomechanism involves the activation of immune processes in predisposed individuals with coagulation disorders or dysfunctions of the vascular endothelium [51,53].",
            "Viruses may precipitate ischemic stroke through several interconnected mechanisms, with vasculopathy being a prominent factor. Systemic infection, persistent inflammation, and immune complex deposition can induce vasculitis, rupture of atherosclerotic plaques, and alteration of vascular wall structure. These factors contribute to vascular damage, increasing the risk of cerebrovascular events. Furthermore, inflammation associated with viral infections can foster the development of atherosclerotic lesions, adversely affecting blood flow in brain tissue. The destabilization and rupture of these atherosclerotic plaques significantly heighten the risk of ischemic stroke [53,54].",
            "Another crucial pathomechanism associated with acute viral illness is the disruption of blood coagulation processes, manifesting as hypercoagulability and thrombosis. Viral infections may trigger the synthesis of acute phase proteins and initiate the coagulation cascade. Additionally, platelet function may be impaired, leading to increased activation and aggregation. These coagulation abnormalities contribute to the formation of blood clots and thromboembolism. The resultant narrowing or complete occlusion of blood vessels restricts blood flow to the brain, which can precipitate ischemic events [53,55,56]. These mechanisms highlight the complex interplay between viral infections and stroke risk, emphasizing the need for continued research to better understand these pathways and develop effective strategies for prevention and management.",
            "A variety of viruses have been potentially linked to an increased risk of developing acute ischemic stroke [53,56]. One such virus is SARS-CoV-2. Since the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, numerous neurological complications arising from severe infection have been reported [57]. While common mild symptoms related to the nervous system include headache, dizziness, and impaired smell or taste, some patients may experience more severe cerebrovascular and neuropsychiatric manifestations [58]. Many researchers have noted an increased risk of stroke in individuals with COVID-19. Research indicates that the incidence is approximately 1–3% among hospitalized patients and 6% among those in intensive care units [59]. The majority of individuals with COVID-19 who experience a stroke are male (62%), with a mean age of 63 years [60]. Notably, most of these patients present crucial risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia [60,61]. Studies carried out by Merkler et al. [62] suggest that cerebrovascular disorders are more prevalent in COVID-19 patients compared to those with influenza [62]. Although SARS-CoV-2 infection is not an independent cause of stroke, it plays a significant role in its development [60].",
            "COVID-19 is a relatively newly discovered disease, and further research is needed to determine the precise causes of stroke in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, there are several assumptions regarding the potential pathomechanisms of cerebrovascular complications. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, enter cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, predominantly expressed in the endothelium of vessels and internal organs, such as the brain [63,64]. The binding of the viral spike glycoprotein to receptors on infected cells facilitates the entry and release of viral genetic material [63]. SARS-CoV-2 contains a positive-sense single-stranded RNA, recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), primarily Toll-like receptors (TLR), initiating the host’s immune response [63,65]. The presence of ACE-2 receptors in the brain suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may directly affect the nervous system. Indirectly, the risk of ischemic stroke may increase due to the expression of these receptors in the myocardium and endothelium of vessels. The virus may disrupt cardiac muscle cell function, leading to hypoxia, arrhythmias, and thrombotic complications [64,66].",
            "Moreover, hypoxia often occurs in COVID-19 patients. One possible mechanism is the blockade of iron transport caused by the interaction between hepcidin and the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein [67,68]. Hepcidin, a peptide hormone, plays a significant role in systemic iron homeostasis control [69]. Additionally, approximately 20% of the body’s total oxygen supply reaches the brain, making it highly sensitive to oxygen content changes, even slight deficiencies can cause irreversible changes in brain tissue [67]. Inadequate oxygen supply affects coagulation and fibrinolysis processes. Hypoxia-induced inflammatory responses lead to the production of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, further increasing blood coagulability and viscosity, posing a risk of thrombosis and acute ischemic stroke [67,70]. Another potential mechanism of cerebrovascular complications is the “cytokine storm”, which is extremely intense in the case of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. As a consequence, C-reactive protein and other pro-inflammatory markers, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8, are released in excess. Cytokine production is closely related to the functioning of the coagulation system, among others, by releasing tissue factor (TF), which is an activator of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Moreover, pro-inflammatory factors contribute to the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These structures additionally activate coagulation pathways and stimulate the production of thrombin, leading to hypercoagulability [71,72]. Cytokine storm is a phenomenon that can dysregulate the immune response and damage the vascular endothelium and pulmonary alveolus, leading to internal organ failure and even death. This effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection may suggest that anti-inflammatory drugs may reduce the risk of serious complications of the disease [73,74].",
            "Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that cytokine storm coupled with oxidative stress contributes to COVID-19 pathogenesis and immunopathogenesis. This combination causes endothelitis and endothelial cell dysfunction. It also activates the blood clotting cascade, which results in blood coagulation and microvascular thrombosis. So, it is note-worthy that reactive oxygen species induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection can contribute to the development of ischemic stroke and thrombosis. Coronavirus’ infection of host cells results in an imbalance where ROS production rises while the host’s antioxidant responses decrease, culminating in increased redox stress. Oxidative stress can damage the endothelium of blood vessels, potentially contributing to the formation of clots, which can obstruct blood flow. Therefore, it appears that this mechanism may be a key contributor to the development of ischemic stroke and thrombosis, as it can interfere with normal blood flow and facilitate the formation of clots [75,76].",
            "Severe COVID-19 has also been associated with elevated levels of D-dimers, fibrinogen, and activation of the coagulation cascade. Going further, platelets and coagulation factors participate in clot formation, which may lead to thrombosis and microvascular damage. Furthermore, immune system cells, such as macrophages, accumulate in the vascular walls and lead to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. As a result, all of this may increase the risk of ischemic stroke [56,67,77]. On the contrary, some studies indicate that increased D-dimers levels are common in patients with viral infections and for that reason may not be necessarily associated with hypercoagulability [78,79]. Therefore, it is difficult to draw a single definitive conclusion confirming that hypercoagulability caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase the risk of IS.",
            "Additionally, recent studies suggest that the development of IS in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may potentially be related to the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPLs) in the serum. These mainly include: lupus anticoagulant (LAC), anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCL), and anti-β2-Glycoprotein I antibodies (anti-β2-GPI) [78]. Beyrouti et al. examined six patients with COVID-19-related ischemic stroke and five of them were LAC-positive [79]. The study conducted by Capozzi et al. showed that 50% of studied patients tested positive for aCL IgG and IgG anti-β2-GPI was detected in 30% of patients [78]. Consequently, anti-phospholipid antibodies are suspected of playing a role in increasing blood clotting and activating pathways that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, it should be taken into account that these antibodies are sometimes also found in healthy individuals, and only transiently during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, despite ongoing research, the exact mechanisms of the formation and action of circulating aPL remain unclear and require further observation [60,80,81].",
            "COVID-19 causes a wide range of clinical manifestations, including neurological disorders, thrombotic events, and other life-threatening complications. Multiple clinical studies have reported an ischemic stroke in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The impact of viruses on the development of cerebrovascular events is undoubtedly significant. Nevertheless, further investigation is necessary to determine the precise etiology and pathomechanism of a stroke associated with COVID-19 [53,57,59]. The overall mechanism of action of the virus is presented in Figure 2.",
            "Alzheimer’s disease is the leading cause of dementia worldwide, accounting for 50–70% of dementia cases. It is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease that significantly affects patients’ ability to function on a daily basis. Globally, Alzheimer’s disease incidence is expected to rise with aging populations and longer life expectancies, especially in developing countries [82]. Comprehensively, it has been estimated that approximately 50 million individuals suffer from dementia, and by 2050, this number is expected to triple [83]. AD affects both sexes to varying degrees. The global age-specific disease prevalence in women is 1.17 times higher than in men. Women also have a higher age-standardized death rate than males [84]. Alzheimer’s disease begins several decades before clinical symptoms appear [84]. The main features of patients with AD are elevated levels of amyloid-β (Aβ), which forms extracellular senile plaques, and hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau), which aggregates intracellularly in the form of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). All of the above mentioned changes occur in brain tissue [85].",
            "Alzheimer’s disease is a complex and multifactorial disease influenced by both genetic (hereditary) and environmental factors that affect the individual throughout life [84]. Environmental factors influencing Alzheimer’s disease include psychosocial factors including educational achievement, cognitive activity, bilingualism, social involvement, depression, and stress; pre-existing diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular disease, traumatic brain injury, hyperhomocysteinemia, hearing loss, and oral diseases; lifestyle, which includes physical activity, diet, sleep disorders, smoking, drinking alcohol, coffee and tea and other factors including environmental pollution as well as bacterial/viral infections—pathogens like Chlamydia pneumoniae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Salmonella typhimurium, Hepatitis C virus, Human herpesvirus 5, 6A and 7, Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1, Human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1) [82,86,87,88]. A summary of the most common environmental pro- and anti-AD factors is shown in Table 1.",
            "Alzheimer’s disease has been repetitively associated with viral etiology [89]. Two main pathways of viral involvement in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease have been stated. The first is the direct way, where microorganisms directly infect the brain and promote the accumulation of Aβ and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. The second is the indirect route, resulting from the inflammatory effects of the infection [90]. The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has provided evidence of viral involvement in Alzheimer’s disease [91].",
            "Interestingly, it has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may infect the central nervous system. The virus can enter the CNS through several different routes. The first one is the bloodstream spread through infected leukocytes that reach the brain. Another mechanism is the entry of the virus with the use of the spike protein on its surface which binds to the ACE2 receptor on the BBB endothelial cells and via the blood-brain barrier arrives in glial cells and infects them [92,93,94]. Afterward, it passes through the synapses of infected neurons. It has been also assumed that SARS-CoV-2 may reach the CNS from the nasopharynx through the olfactory nerve to the olfactory bulb [93].",
            "The study by Li et al. [95] highlights a significant and intriguing relationship between COVID-19 and an increased risk of AD. While COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness, its impact on the neurological system has become an area of growing concern and interest. The before mentioned study finds an association between COVID-19 and AD development. The research explores potential reasons, focusing on the severity of COVID-19, the role of immune-related pathways, the deterioration of lung health, and shared genetic factors. One of the key findings of the study was the suggestion that a severe course of COVID-19 may contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s disease, whereas mild cases of the virus infection do not seem to pose the risk of the same intensity. This is due to the fact that patients experiencing severe COVID-19 often undergo intense immune responses, which lead to systemic inflammation and damage across various organs, including the brain. Systemic inflammation may accelerate or trigger processes related to neurodegeneration, particularly in individuals who are predisposed to Alzheimer’s disease [95]. Moreover, a clear connection between lung health and cognitive function has been observed. Declining lung health in middle age has been associated with mild cognitive decline and an increased risk of dementia [85]. COVID-19 significantly impacts lung conditions, leading to inflammation and long-term respiratory issues [96]. This deterioration may, in turn, impair cognitive functions, exacerbating symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The study identifies 60 common genes expressed at high levels in the lungs, spleen, adipose tissue, and blood, shared by both COVID-19 and Alzheimer’s disease. These genes play a role in local immune responses in both conditions. Interestingly, in Alzheimer’s patients, the levels of these genes were additionally downregulated in the brain, likely due to disease-related changes. This genetic link suggests a common pathway that may increase susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease when infected with COVID-19 [85]. Some researchers have also proposed that SARS-CoV-2 infection might lead to brain tissue atrophy, which is connected to damaging neurons and synapses, particularly around the brain’s ventricles [97]. The above mentioned findings provide valuable insights into the complex relationship between COVID-19 and Alzheimer’s disease. The unique association suggests that severe COVID-19 infections may trigger processes related to AD, primarily through immune-related pathways and the deterioration of lung health. The shared genetic factors and the potential for brain atrophy further underscore the intricate connection between these two conditions.",
            "What is more, the study of Atkins J.L. et al. [98] found that pre-existing dementia was the main risk factor for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. This factor was more significant than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 diabetes, and depression [98]. This study revealed that the mortality rate due to COVID-19 infection among patients with dementia was higher than among those without dementia [98]. Alzheimer’s disease was the most common diagnosis of cognitive impairment among patients who died from COVID-19 according to a Spanish study conducted by Martín-Jiménez P. et al. [99]. Furthermore, COVID-19 survivors were shown to have a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with new-onset dementia within 6 months after infection than controls [100]. This indicates a mutual relationship in the occurrence of both diseases.",
            "According to Atkins et al., SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with dementia is distinguished by distinct clinical symptoms. The most common symptom is delirium, which occurs in 36.2% of all cases, while the control group has a frequency of 11.6%. Furthermore, other common COVID-19 symptoms, such as shortness of breath, muscle pain, chills, nausea, vomiting, and headache, were less frequently reported in individuals with dementia than in the control group [101]. According to a different study, at the onset of COVID-19, delirium and confusion developed in 82.4% of dementia patients, among which the most common cause of dementia was Alzheimer’s disease. Other common symptoms of COVID-19 included asthenia (76.8%), fever (72.8%), polypnea (51.2%), and desaturation (50.4%). Falls occurred in 35.2% of patients in the initial phase of the disease. A total of 19.2% of patients suffered from persistent disorientation and behavioral problems [102]. In a different study by Bianchetti A. et al. [103], the most common primary symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection were delirium and deterioration of functional status [103].",
            "The ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis plays an important role in maintaining normal cognitive functioning and protecting against neurodegeneration, as opposed to ACE and Ang II, which have been shown to impair cognitive functions [101,102,104,105]. The study conducted by Jiang T. et al. [106] discovered that Ang-1-7 levels were significantly reduced in the brain tissues of Alzheimer’s disease mice and that Ang-1-7 levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus were inversely related to tau hyperphosphorylation [107]. Another study, conducted by Liu S. et al. [108] found that patients with Alzheimer’s disease had reduced serum ACE2 activity than patients from control groups. A different study conducted by Ding Q. et al. [109] proved that Alzheimer’s patients’ brains had higher levels of ACE2 protein expression, regardless of age, gender, or disease severity [101].",
            "Correspondingly, Aβ43 and Aβ42, longer forms of Aβ, are the main factors causing Aβ accumulation in the brain in the course of Alzheimer’s disease due to their neurotoxicity and high amyloidogenicity [110]. ACE2 has been found to convert Aβ43 to Aβ42, which is subsequently transformed by ACE to the less toxic Aβ40, which may have neuroprotective properties. This inhibits aggregation and delays the deposition of Aβ42 amyloid [111,112,113]. Aβ42 has been shown to have a high affinity for the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein and ACE2. In the study of Rudnicka-Drożak E. et al. [114] with artificially created SARS-CoV-2, Aβ42 was found to boost spike protein binding to ACE2, viral entry, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. In the case of Aβ40, no such effect was observed [114]. The study showed significantly increased ACE2 expression in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, temporal and occipital lobes. The temporal lobe and hippocampus are places particularly involved in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease [115]. The results of this study suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection of Alzheimer’s disease patients leads to increased virus infiltration into their brain cells when compared to healthy individuals, due to the increased expression of ACE2 in the course of AD [114]. ACE2 is an enzyme that regulates the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays an important role in neurodevelopment, neurogenesis, cognitive function, and prevention of neurodegeneration [44,45]. The study showed that a deficiency of this enzyme leads to impaired cognitive functions [116]. It can be suspected that SARS-CoV-2 infection, through inhibition of ACE2 and BDNF, may cause neurodegenerative changes by escalation of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis [117].",
            "Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a protein whose main function is the transport of cholesterol and other lipids to the neurons [118]. It is produced mainly in astrocytes and microglia cells, and under certain conditions also in neurons [116]. ApoE occurs in three isoforms that differ in their lipid transport properties and neuronal plasticity [118,119]. The study of Drouet B. et al. [120] showed that the occurrence of apoE2 and apoE3 isoforms is connected with the prevention of Aβ aggregation and neurotoxicity. These properties have not been demonstrated for apoE4 [120]. Individuals who carry the allele that encodes the apoE4 isoform have the highest risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease [121]. Data analysis performed by Kuo C.L. et al. [122] showed that apoE4 isoform homozygotes were more than two times more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than apoE3 isoform homozygotes. It was also discovered that the apoE4 isoform increases the risk of severe COVID-19, regardless of pre-existing dementia, cardiovascular diseases, or type 2 diabetes [122]. A different study showed that high blood cholesterol levels facilitate the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells via ACE2 receptors by binding cholesterol to ApoE receptors [123]. These findings suggest a greater susceptibility of neurons and astrocytes encoded by the apoE4 isoform to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its subsequent increased severity [114].",
            "The inflammation hypothesis in Alzheimer’s disease is one of the main theories about the pathology of the disease, along with Aβ deposition and the presence of tau tangles. Continuous activation of microglia and immune cells exacerbates the pathology of beta-amyloid plaques and tau proteins [124]. The brain of a patient suffering from Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by chronic inflammation. Activated microglial cells secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) [125]. It was also found that in the case of AD patients, serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-α are higher compared to healthy individuals [126].",
            "A state of excessive inflammation, the so-called “cytokine storm” is a characteristic feature of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines were found to be elevated during COVID-19 [127]. This dysregulated immune response, resulting in elevated cytokine levels, may be due in part to activation of the NLR family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome by open reading frame 3a (ORF3a), an accessory protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [128,129,130,131]. Studies performed by Stancu et al. [132] and Heneka et al. [133] have shown that Aβ plaques and tau aggregates can stimulate the activation of the NLRP3 microglial inflammasome [132,133]. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome impairs normal microglial function, leading to reduced clearance of Aβ42 in the brain [134]. NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been implicated as a key neuroinflammatory pathway in Alzheimer’s disease, contributing to cognitive decline [135]. Since the ORF3a protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, this mechanism may further enhance the already existing neuroinflammation caused by the activation of this inflammasome in the course of AD [136].",
            "Oxidative stress has been found to be another important factor contributing to the initiation and progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Oxidative stress occurs as a result of redox imbalance due to excessive production of ROS, which ultimately leads to the loss of neurons [137]. Studies by Li et al. [138] have found that oxidative stress promotes the accumulation of Aβ. On the other hand, different studies by Matsouka et al. [139] have shown that Aβ promotes oxidative stress. A significant amount of evidence also suggests the involvement of oxidative stress in tau hyperphosphorylation and polymerization [140,141]. Moreover, numerous studies (i.e. by Hamilton et al. [142]) have shown that oxidative stress increases with age. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, oxidative stress has been found to play a role in perpetuating the cytokine storm and increased cellular hypoxia [143,144]. ROS are overproduced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection as part of the toxic innate immune response against viral agents [145]. The addition of oxidative stress induced by ROS overproduction during SARS-CoV-2 infection to the already increased oxidative stress in AD patients due to age is a potential mechanism for disease intensification caused by COVID-19 [146].",
            "The relationship between SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, and AD is a critical area of research. As one of the most common comorbidities associated with COVID-19, Alzheimer’s disease presents unique challenges and complications when co-occurring with this viral infection. One of the most significant impacts of the co-occurrence of Alzheimer’s disease and COVID-19 is the increased mortality risk among patients. Studies indicate that individuals with AD who contract COVID-19 have a much higher chance of experiencing severe outcomes, including death [114]. Several factors contribute to the elevated risk of severe COVID-19 infections in Alzheimer’s patients, including their age and vulnerability, as they are often older and have compromised health, as well as their weakened immune systems, which make it harder for them to fight off infections like SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, oxidative stress is a common factor in AD, contributing to neuronal damage. COVID-19 can exacerbate oxidative stress, worsening Alzheimer’s symptoms and potentially accelerating disease progression. The presence of the ApoE ε4 allele in some individuals is another link between COVID-19 and Alzheimer’s. This allele not only increases the risk of developing AD but also facilitates the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells, leading to more severe infections. What is more, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is used by the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter host cells. In Alzheimer’s disease, the expression of ACE2 is often increased, making these patients more susceptible to viral entry and infection [114]. While current data provide insights into how SARS-CoV-2 impacts Alzheimer’s disease, the exact mechanisms remain incompletely understood. More research is essential to fully unravel the interactions between these two conditions. The general mechanism of action of the virus is presented in Figure 3.",
            "In summary, an association between COVID-19 and a number of neurodegenerative disorders has been observed. Alzheimer’s disease, ischemic stroke, and multiple sclerosis have all been linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The immunological pathways disrupted by COVID-19 significantly overlap with the pathogenic mechanisms of MS, IS, and AD. It suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection could serve as an environmental risk factor for neurological disease manifestation in susceptible individuals. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and production of interferons and neurotoxic cytokines that harm the myelin sheaths, which are responsible for protecting nerve cells. The body starts to synthesize autoantibodies that attack glial cells and neurons, harming the anatomical components of the brain which contributes to the onset of multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 virus exacerbates the disease in individuals who are already suffering from MS by causing inflammation and nerve cell destruction through its influence on the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Going forward, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to an increase in blood clotting. Cytokine storm affects the activation of coagulation pathways and the formation of NETs, leading to hypercoagulability. This condition can result in thrombosis, which blocks the flow of blood to the brain and causes an ischemic stroke. Severe inflammation and increased oxidative stress have been described in Alzheimer’s disease. Increased manifestation of these alterations has been observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection. It was observed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus enters cells more easily when the ACE2 receptor, whose expression is already elevated in AD, and the ApoE ε4 allele (which occurs in some individuals) are present. In this regard, the disease worsens and advances more quickly at the same time increasing the mortality rate of AD patients. Interestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to intracellular dysregulation and a decrease in ATP production by damage and mutations in mitochondrial DNA. This disrupts the transmission of electrical signals and leads to damage of neurons, contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The above findings indicate that there are several connections between the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity as well as incidence of selected neurodegenerative diseases. The described pathomechanisms may help to understand the impact of viral infection on the functioning of the nervous system. Despite that, COVID-19 is still a relatively new and little-understood disease. For this reason, it is difficult to determine its long-term effects and the impact on the development of severe complications, which constitutes some limitations of the study. New studies on this issue are still being published and more accurate information may appear in the future. Hence, more extensive research on that topic needs to be conducted to clearly determine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the development of neurological diseases. A good direction for future research would be to clearly determine how the virus affects the development of neurodegenerative diseases, whether there are certain groups of patients in whom contact with the virus poses a greater risk of developing and intensifying disease symptoms, and how it would be possible to prevent the development of diseases.",

            "Many coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) positive individuals exhibit abnormal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity reflecting “brain fog” and mild cognitive impairments even months after the acute phase of infection. Resting‐state EEG abnormalities include EEG slowing (reduced alpha rhythm; increased slow waves) and epileptiform activity. An expert panel conducted a systematic review to present compelling evidence that cognitive deficits due to COVID‐19 and to Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) are driven by overlapping pathologies and neurophysiological abnormalities. EEG abnormalities seen in COVID‐19 patients resemble those observed in early stages of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly ADRD. It is proposed that similar EEG abnormalities in Long COVID and ADRD are due to parallel neuroinflammation, astrocyte reactivity, hypoxia, and neurovascular injury. These neurophysiological abnormalities underpinning cognitive decline in COVID‐19 can be detected by routine EEG exams. Future research will explore the value of EEG monitoring of COVID‐19 patients for predicting long‐term outcomes and monitoring efficacy of therapeutic interventions.",

            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection can induce “Long COVID,” a postacute sequela of COVID‐19 that refers to persistent symptoms continuing for months or longer after the initial SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The persistent symptoms affect multiple physiological systems with respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and psychological symptoms.\n1\n One study found that 76% of individuals with mild‐to‐moderate COVID‐19 experienced at least one persistent symptom 6 months after their initial infection.\n2\n Another study found that 52% of COVID‐19 survivors experienced persistent symptoms 3 months after infection. These persistent symptoms can significantly impair individuals’ quality of life and result in higher healthcare costs.\n3",
            "Neurological symptoms are a significant part of Long COVID, and understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial for better diagnosis and treatment. In a meta‐analysis of 18 studies on 10,530 patients 3 months after COVID‐19 onset, overall prevalence of neurological symptoms was 32% for brain fog, 28% for memory problems, and 22% for attention disorder.\n4\n Another report with clinical observations of neurological complications in 236,379 patients in the 6 months after a COVID‐19 diagnosis found that 33.62% of patients had demonstrated clinically significant neurological or psychiatric dysfunction.\n5",
            "Neurological symptoms of Long COVID reflect the COVID‐19 neuroinvasion and include headache, tremors, problems with attention and concentration, sluggish cognitive function, dysfunction in the peripheral nerves, and mental health problems.\n6\n, \n7\n Beyond these typical brain fog symptoms, systematic evidence suggests frequent associations with depression\n4\n and post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n8\n Together, these symptoms can be characterized as “brain fog.” The American Medical Association defines brain fog as some persistent neurological symptoms, including slowed cognition, concentration difficulties, confusion, and forgetfulness.\n9\n Most people with Long COVID report instances of severe fatigue and brain fog several months after their initial infection.\n10\n Those symptoms may fluctuate or relapse over time.\n11",
            "The relationship between SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and cognitive impairment is another important topic.\n12\n Long‐term effects of COVID‐19 on cognition are illustrated by a recent case study, reporting a 62‐year‐old woman suffering from persistent cognitive deficits 8 months after COVID‐19 infection with no preinfection history of cognitive impairment. At follow‐up observation, the individual showed symptoms of memory loss, confusion, slowed motor function, and difficulty in language production and comprehension.\n13\n Similarly, a recent study examining cognitive functioning in adults following a COVID‐19 infection found that those with persistent unresolved symptoms exhibited larger deficits than those with quickly resolved symptoms and those in the non‐COVID‐19 control group.\n14\n Those deficits included poor memory and reasoning, as well as increased brain fog. These studies present a model for potential neurophysiological and neurological dysfunctions due to COVID‐19 neuroinvasion.\n13\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17",
            "As research has progressed throughout the pandemic, a growing number of studies have reported cases of Long COVID patients suffering from similar impairments in focus and attention, memory retrieval, executive functioning, language production, and visuospatial abilities.\n1\n, \n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n This cognitive impairment did not occur only in the acute disease phase and in severe cases.\n21\n, \n22\n Possible causes of emergence of ADRD included microglial inflammation,\n23\n ischemic changes associated with COVID‐19,\n24\n and endothelial lesions that can impair the clearance of brain metabolites including beta‐amyloid peptides, which are involved in AD.\n25\n Structurally, there was reduced brain grey and white matter in individuals with brain fog and in recovered patients, along with cortical thinning in frontal and temporal lobes.\n26\n In brain organoids, astrocytic subclusters with enrichment for genes that are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to upregulation of pathways found commonly in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) in response to SARS‐CoV‐2.\n27\n Furthermore, patients with COVID‐19 encephalopathy have higher plasma neurofilament light chain (pNfL) and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (pGFAP) concentrations which indicate neuronal dysfunction and CNS injury in their blood, like many other types of dementias.\n28",
            "EEG markers may be of interest for the clinical research carried out in patients with cognitive impairment, as they are noninvasive, repeatable without significant learning effects, globally available, and cost‐effective.\n29\n Scalp‐recorded EEG recordings allow the investigation of underlying cortical neural activities, including ionic current flows and related voltages, with a great time resolution (less than 1 msec).\n30\n It is also well known that EEG markers provide evidence of nonspecific alterations in neuronal network activities caused by underlying neurodegenerative or vascular changes\n31\n, \n32\n, \n33\n in the early stages of cognitive impairments.\n34\n, \n35\n Furthermore, topographical and spectral features of EEG measured at rest reflect neurophysiological oscillatory mechanisms underpinning the (dys)regulation of vigilance, mood, and cognition. The ability to measure these features at rest (i.e., while the individual is sitting with their eyes open or closed) is a particular strength, as it allows for the study of brain function and connectivity in healthy individuals and in those with ADRD alike.\n36",
            "Previous studies have reported that rsEEG rhythms are abnormal in patients suffering from persistent or Long COVID brain fog; specifically, individuals exhibit topographically focal or diffuse “slowing” of rsEEG rhythms.\n16\n, \n37\n This slowing can be quantified by the spectral analysis of rsEEG rhythms as diffuse power density increase in rsEEG activity at low frequencies, such as delta (<4 Hz) and theta (4–7 Hz) frequency bands, and power density decrease at alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) frequencies. In the healthy aging brain, rsEEG activity at alpha frequencies reflects spontaneous synchronization of cortical and thalamic neurons as a main neurophysiological mechanism regulating global cortical arousal states and vigilance.\n34\n, \n36",
            "In severe cases of COVID‐19, EEG has been found to be a valuable method to assess early neurological changes, including encephalopathy, seizures, and status epilepticus.\n38\n In COVID‐19 patients, EEG displays several abnormalities including epileptiform activity and generalized slowing, especially in frontal regions, despite normal brain MRI.\n39\n, \n40\n, \n41\n During the early phase of the pandemic, two meta‐analyses reported abnormal background EEG activity in COVID‐19 patients, showing EEG pathologies between 69% and 96% of patients.\n39\n, \n41\n In these reports, epileptiform activity was observed in lower proportions (20% and 23% respectively). EEG seizures in COVID‐19 patients were associated with higher mortality rates.\n42\n However, this finding may be related to the fact that patients with diagnosis of previously existing epilepsy or comorbid conditions tend to display higher rates of EEG abnormalities.\n39\n, \n42\n, \n43",
            "In summary, Long COVID involves complex interactions between cognitive functions, structural and molecular mechanisms, and neurophysiological alterations related to underlying activities of neuronal networks. While much remains to be explored, these recent findings provide valuable insights for future research and suggest potential assessment, monitoring, and therapeutic strategies using EEG recordings.",
            "Two reviews of EEG findings in COVID‐19 patients in 2020 and 2021 demonstrated slowing of EEG waveforms with COVID‐19.\n39\n, \n44\n The expert panel of electrophysiological professional interest area (EPIA) associated with Alzheimer Association has previously published a review on slowing of resting‐state EEG features for clinical trials in AD/ADRD. After formulating the research question regarding COVID‐19 and EEG, we conducted key word searches from multiple sources, for example, PubMed, Google Scholar, National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and literature software.

Two authors (Y.J. and J.N.) reviewed each article to determine relevance to EEG and cognitive decline and brain fog. New citations of several encompassing reviews on COVID‐19 or cognitive decline were identified and reviewed for further follow up of sources.\n17\n, \n18\n, \n20\n, \n45\n, \n46\n From this, additional studies were identified pertaining to the effect of COVID‐19 on cognitive decline, with a specific focus on EEG correlates.

            "EEG studies highlighting the features of rsEEG abnormalities in Long COVID patients showed interesting results summarized in Table 2.\n15\n, \n17\n, \n40\n, \n59\n, \n60\n Background “slowing” of rsEEG rhythms was a common finding.\n15\n, \n17\n Specifically, the posterior dominance in rsEEG alpha rhythms (typical in noninfected individuals) was observed in only 42% of patients with Long COVID, while the others are characterized by dominant power in theta (42%) or theta‐delta (14%) bands.\n15\n Furthermore, hemispherical asymmetries in rsEEG amplitude were abnormally high at delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands in Long COVID patients.\n17\n, \n61\n Abnormally high rsEEG delta rhythms on widespread scalp regions were the most common abnormality in Long COVID patients.\n15\n, \n17\n, \n40\n, \n61\n Notably, Brutto et al. (2021) reported that individuals with a history of mild COVID‐19 infection are 18 times more likely to develop long term brain disorder and cognitive decline than controls based on 6‐month follow‐up rsEEG.\n17\n Both verbal memory deficits and frontal executive functioning issues were also correlated with rsEEG abnormalities in Long COVID patients 2 months after the infection.\n40",
            "Some abnormalities in rsEEG activity reported in Long COVID patients were observed in patients with ADRD. For example, abnormally high rsEEG delta‐theta power density over widespread scalp regions was reported in AD patients, in comparison to healthy controls.\n62\n, \n63\n Furthermore, early AD patients typically showed a shift to lower frequency in rsEEG rhythms\n29\n and altered task‐evoked EEG potentials, which led to gradual loss of cognitive functions, especially working memory and executive functions, as well as slower reaction times.\n64\n Such slowing of rsEEG rhythms is thought to reflect a thalamocortical “disconnection mode” during disease progression from preclinical to clinical stages of ADRD.\n29\n Along these lines, similar abnormally prominent rsEEG activity was reported in patients with MCI, partially induced by vascular or metabolic dysfunctions, for example, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.\n63\n Overall, a continuum of alterations in rsEEG was associated with pathological aging, generally characterized by reduced alpha and beta power and increased delta and theta power in ADRD compared to healthy controls, with some variation across brain regions. There were also reductions in the frequency and power density of the posterior dominant rhythm in AD.",
            "It is not entirely clear how COVID‐19 contributes to a shift to lower frequencies in the rsEEG activity, parallel to that observed in ADRD patients.\n65\n New magnetoencephalographic (MEG) evidence supports the link between “slowing” in the brain rhythms and cellular mechanisms of impaired cerebral excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) synaptic functions associated with tau and A‐beta (Aβ) in AD patients.\n66\n, \n67\n In these seminal studies, increased excitatory activity was related to high tau levels, while increased inhibitory time‐constants correlated with higher Aβ depositions.\n66\n Linking these effects to the abnormal rsEEG activity seen in Long COVID patients, it can be speculated that similar accumulation of amyloid and tau may co‐occur with the neuroinflammatory, autoimmune, hypoxia, and cerebrovascular alterations that are often observed in ADRD patients.\n67",
            "Understanding a potential relationship between COVID‐19 and the amyloid and tau pathologies could also be insightful. Studies show that COVID‐19 patients having neurological symptoms had amyloid pathologies. For instance, patients with amyloidosis are at a higher risk for severe COVID‐19 infection and mortality.\n68\n Furthermore, total‐tau and neurofilament light (NfL) chain in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were elevated in one in four COVID‐19 patients with acute neurological syndromes compared to non‐COVID‐19 control patients.\n69\n Both in vivo and in vitro studies showed that amyloid precursor protein promotes the entry of SARS‐CoV‐2 virus into cells and further aggravates AD pathology.\n70",
            "At the molecular level, microarray and RNAseq dataset analysis suggest common enriched genes in COVID‐19 and AD. These include hub genes, specific miRNA targets associated with COVID‐19 and AD, and several enriched cell‐signaling pathways, such as PI3K‐AKT, Neurotrophin, Rap1, and Ras, which may induce amyloid precursor protein and tau hyperphosphorylation associated with neurodegeneration.\n71\n, \n72\n The structure of SARS‐CoV‐2 includes four proteins: spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins, which form amyloid fibrils intracellularly or extracellularly (spike protein).\n73\n Besides direct viral induction of Aβ, indirect connections between COVID‐19 and Aβ are also reported. For example, COVID‐19 as a respiratory disease causes hypoxia that has been linked with increased Aβ burden and dementia.\n74\n Alternative indirect COVID‐19‐Aβ burden connection mechanisms were also reported, including inflammation,\n75\n blood‐brain barrier breakdown,\n76\n, \n77\n glucose metabolism dysregulation,\n78\n and commonly associated genetic risk factors such as apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4).\n79\n For example, one study reported increased proinflammatory cytokines in the CSF of COVID‐19 patients, which negatively correlated with decreased CSF soluble amyloid precursor protein.\n80\n Intriguingly, SARS‐CoV‐2 induced Aβ burden can serve dual functions, both in a protective role and by activating Aβ expression and toxicity underlying AD progression.\n81\n, \n82\n, \n83\n More knowledge needs to be gained to understand the unprecedented condition that we will be facing in the next few decades. Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest that the links between amyloid, tau pathology, and COVID‐19 may explain the slowing EEG waves in COVID‐patients.",
            "Hypoxia, which is associated with ADRD, including AD and cerebrovascular dementia,\n84\n is another possible cause of abnormalities in rsEEG activity and neurological symptoms in Long COVID patients. Hypoxia serves as a vital connection between lung and heart deficits that are linked to cerebrovascular dysfunction in the brain. Here, we present well established evidence that hypoxia contributes to rsEEG activity and likely to Long COVID. COVID‐19 infection impacts brain blood perfusion and oxygenation by several mechanisms. SARS‐CoV‐2 neuroinvasion through the cerebral vasculature may affect regional brain blood flow and metabolism, thus affecting the synchronization of oscillatory activity in cortical and thalamic neurons, which underlie dominant rsEEG alpha rhythms and regulation of cortical arousal and vigilance.\n29\n, \n85\n, \n86\n Lower oxygen saturation levels have been linked with more severe rsEEG abnormalities, indicating that higher levels of hypoxemia could contribute to brain dysfunction. Related EEG abnormalities include mostly diffuse and focal slowing, and absence of posterior dominant rhythm.\n87",
            "COVID‐19 is associated with respiratory symptoms and often requires treatment via ventilation in severe cases connected to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS can induce hypoxia, which results in hypoxic encephalopathy, particularly in older individuals with high vulnerability to oxidative stress.\n45\n Respiratory damage can even give rise to silent hypoxia, defined as a condition where an individual has alarmingly lower oxygen saturation levels than anticipated (∼50%–80% saturation, while the anticipated saturation level is 95% or higher) in the absence of any breathing difficulty.\n88\n As illustrated by Rahman et al. (2021), silent hypoxia has been associated with several COVID‐19 related symptoms.\n89\n Silent hypoxia can result in overexpression of ACE2 receptors thereby increasing the risk of damage through COVID‐19 infection. The condition can also further contribute to the mechanism of the “cytokine storm” by recruiting different mediators of inflammation. Moreover, silent hypoxia can cause serious endothelial damage through nuclear factor kappa B (NF‐kB) transcription factor activation. Finally, silent hypoxia can signal a different immune‐metabolism pathway and cause secondary organ damage. All these factors lead to the critical condition of COVID‐19 patients along with an increased mortality rate.\n89",
            "Hypoxia could result from abnormal heart‐brain connections as well. The heart provides oxygen for the brain through cardiovascular blood flow that is regulated by the balance of two branches of autonomic activity (symptomatic and parasympathetic/vagal nerves). The autonomic activity is proxied by heart‐rate variability (HRV), which has been reported to change in COVID‐19 patients. For example, in a recent study, resting HRV predicted survival in patients aged 70 and older.\n90\n COVID‐19 was shown to be related to decreased HRV,\n91\n suggesting COVID‐19 may link with autonomic dysfunction. Autonomic dysfunction may be reflected by orthostatic intolerance, which has been experienced by some COVID‐19 patients.\n92\n Orthostatic intolerance or autonomic dysfunction can be associated with hypoperfusion in the brain and may contribute to hypoxia and cognitive symptoms (e.g., brain fog). Besides HRV, the change of cardiovascular activity can also result from COVID‐19 infection in the heart itself.\n93\n, \n94\n Changes in cardiac tissue will affect the pumping activity and eventually link to hypoperfusion of the brain. Allostatic interoceptive overload, commonly observed in dementia via autonomic‐cardiac‐brain interaction, could also represent a complex and multilevel mechanism involved in COVID‐19.",
            "An EEG signature in some COVID‐19 patients who are slow to recover consciousness includes burst suppression.\n95\n Burst suppression is an EEG pattern during which active and isoelectric (flat) periods alternate. The characteristics of burst suppression suggest that it can be a dynamic process, affecting nearly the entire cortex, and that it is associated with a decreased cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption. Electrophysiological modeling has shown that burst suppression is likely a signature of a neurometabolic state that preserves basic cellular function “during states of lowered energy availability.” These brain states likely serve as a neuroprotective mechanism. Prolonged coma and recovery accompanied with hypoxia and markedly reduced brain metabolism with similar EEG patterns are present in certain patients after cardiac arrest and in certain anoxia‐tolerant vertebrates.\n95\n In some severe COVID‐19 encephalopathy patients, an AC pattern may be observed. The predominant, generalized, and symmetrical rhythm within the alpha frequency band\n58\n is rare in other encephalopathies but has a relatively high incidence in COVID‐19 encephalopathy, which may imply neurotropism with a predilection for the brainstem ascending reticular system.\n54",
            "Hypoxia related EEG patterns in COVID‐19 patients may mimic those seen in sleep apneas (OSA). In a study of men with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), severity of hypoxia was significantly associated with EEG slowing and reduced power across all frequency bands, predominantly in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and with beta power during non‐REM (NREM) sleep.\n96\n Reduced P300 amplitudes in severe OSA (SOSA) patients suggest impaired attentional resources during stimulus evaluation processes, while prolonged P300 latency is linked to altered stimulus classification and cognitive processing speed.\n97\n The alterations in brain electrical activity in regions associated with emotional regulation, long‐term memory, and the default mode network may be caused by chronic global hypoxic state.\n98",
            "Previous studies indicate that transient experimental hypoxia induces abnormal posterior resting state delta and alpha rhythms in healthy volunteers.\n99\n A study comparing EEGs of subjects who inhaled an acute hypoxic mixture at sea level or who reached a high‐altitude area under chronic hypoxia, showed that severe hypoxia caused more obvious abnormalities on EEGs, and that acute hypoxia caused more obvious abnormalities but faster recovery than chronic hypoxia.\n100\n, \n101\n Other studies indicate that during systemic hypoxia, the spectral power of rsEEG with closed eyes increases, except for in the alpha band.\n101\n In the alpha band, a rapid decrease in power is observed, which is greater at mild desaturation,\n102\n especially in the first 150 s of hypoxia.\n103\n Regarding event‐related potentials (ERPs), significant reduction can be observed in the amplitude of the visual mismatch negativity (MMN) under hypoxic conditions.\n104\n Acute hypoxia has been found to impair neural activity in motor executive and inhibitory processing, cause a reduction in the peak amplitudes of Go‐P300 and No‐go‐P300, and delay peak latency of Go‐P300\n105\n and P300 latency,\n106\n with no change in earlier components (i.e., P200 or N100).\n107\n Thus, cognitive ERPs can be sensitive to hypoxia induced cognitive impairments. Regarding modality, auditory responses are believed to be less sensitive to hypoxia compared to visual responses, resulting in relatively less slowing with auditory stimuli.\n107\n Regarding topography of hypoxic changes in the brain, a MEG study localized an increase in beta‐1 activity to the right superior frontal gyrus, indicating a relationship between prefrontal activation and performance deficits.\n108\n Further research is needed to understand the relationship between EEG/MEG alterations and hypoxic conditions directly resulting from COVID‐19.",
            "COVID‐19 can lead to CNS hypometabolism as well. Brain hypometabolism, measured by positron emission tomography (PET), has been observed in Long COVID patients with persistent memory impairment.\n109\n Furthermore, Martini et al. (2022) reported a diffuse brain hypometabolism in COVID‐19 patients followed longitudinally, which recovered after 5 months along with blood saturation and inflammatory biomarker levels, and cognitive status.\n110\n In these patients, EEG monitoring showed general “slowing” of frontal rsEEG rhythms, along with a spread in frontal hypometabolism.\n16\n Arica‐Polat et al. (2022) reported that cognitive impairment due to COVID‐19 infection may be caused by ACE receptor density in the pial, hippocampal, and amygdala areas.\n111\n Furthermore, individuals with severe dementia having a milder COVID‐19 infection could be explained by gray matter atrophy in those brain areas.",
            "Building on emerging evidence of EEG abnormality in COVID‐19, the expanded Expert Panel endorsed the present narrative review to clarify the likely relationships between EEG abnormalities related to Long COVID (Figure 3). Next, the hypotheses of possible overlapping pathophysiological and neurophysiological mechanisms underlying Long COVID and ADRD are examined.",
            "Electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormality in healthy versus coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) positive individuals. Scalp EEG signals measure synchronized postsynaptic current and neurovascular network activity. EEG abnormalities observed in COVID‐19 patients display increased slow‐wave and epileptiform‐like EEG signals in mostly frontal sites, as seen in Table 1 (acute) and Table 2 (Long COVID). Cognitive and neurological dysfunctions reported in COVID‐19 patients resemble those with mild cognitive impairment due to neurodegenerative diseases.",
            "Recent studies have discussed how Long COVID infection can affect neuronal activity and cognitive status, though the exact pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the neurological and psychiatric consequences of Long COVID have not been determined conclusively.\n112\n Early in the pandemic, it was debated whether the SARS‐Co‐V2 virus can directly infect central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems, or if the “neurotoxicity” may result from indirect immune‐mediated mechanisms.\n110\n The CNS was found to be substantially involved in COVID‐19 based on several neurological and pathophysiological symptoms,\n113\n although there are varying degrees of CNS involvement in the acute phase of COVID‐19 patients.\n87\n Patients with transient COVID‐19 effects may have a substantially preserved neuronal function illustrated by normal background rsEEG alpha activity; in contrast, those with more severe prognoses exhibited significant rsEEG abnormalities.\n87\n A few causative neurobiological and neurophysiological mechanisms for Long COVID and abnormal rsEEG activity are outlined below. These mechanisms will be also discussed in relation to ADRD for the similarities in the rsEEG abnormalities in Long COVID and ADRD.",
            "One of the most likely mechanisms of COVID‐19 neuroinvasion explaining the “slowing” of rsEEG activity is the inflammatory response to the SARS‐COVID‐19 virus, leading to cytokine‐mediated neuroinflammation.\n114\n Binding of coronavirus spike proteins to ACE2 in the bloodstream\n115\n can affect ACE2 expression throughout cerebral vasculature, resulting in vascular inflammation and possibly the disruption of the blood‐brain barrier (BBB). Infiltration of bloodborne particles into the brain is a well‐known trigger for the activation of microglia and astrocytes associated with elevated neuroinflammatory signaling.\n116\n Moreover, inflammation‐mediated disruption of the BBB can make astrocytes and other resident brain cells directly accessible to SARS‐CoV‐2 viral particles.",
            "Astrocytes are metabolic liaisons between cerebral vessels and neurons. Nearly every cerebral vessel is sheathed by specialized processes called astrocyte endfeet (circles in Figure 4). Other astrocyte processes cradle many, if not most, excitatory connections in the brain. Astrocytes can uptake viral particles directly through coronavirus coreceptors (e.g., CD147 or DPP4), or through interactions with other perivascular cells like pericytes. Not surprisingly, astrocytic injury has been reported to occur early in acute phases of COVID‐19 infection.\n117\n Once injured (or activated), astrocytes can release a wide array of cytokines and chemokines. Astrocytes were suggested to play a major role in the generation of an inflammatory cytokine storm response following infection with a murine coronavirus that mirrors COVID‐19. Viral infection of astrocytes has been linked to encephalitis and other acute inflammation‐related morbidities.\n118",
            "Complex brain pathophysiology and pathology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). COVID‐19 is a viral pathogen that systemically induces blood immune cell activation, glycocalyx damage, blood clotting, vascular damage and dysfunction observed in heart attack and stroke. This causes blood component infiltration, hypoperfusion and glia cell activation in brain tissue. The circles illustrate endfeet of astrocyte in modulation of synaptic functions. Alternatively, this viral particle could directly enter and trigger parenchymal astrocyte and microglia activation. Proinflammatory cytotoxic cytokines and complements produced from both blood and glia cells cause neuroinflammation and neuronal injury. Dysregulation of glutamate, calcium signaling, and oxidative stress further complicates physiological function of synapses and neurons. This complex pathophysiology is similarly found in AD and ADRDs where vascular pathology and neuronal loss are commonly observed. Hypoxia, oxygen, and heart‐brain dysfunction contribute to EEG signals. Consequently, signs and symptoms of confusion, inability to concentrate, learning and memory impairment are concurrently found with reduced electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and abnormal EEG synchrony in cortical, subcortical, and deep brain regions.",
            "Astrocyte reactivity is a prominent feature of AD and most ADRDs (e.g. in response toxic Ab and Tau species) where it is suspected as a proximal cause of neuroinflammation, cerebrovascular dysfunction, impaired synapse function, and neuronal hyperexcitability.\n119\n, \n120\n Like AD and ADRDs, changes in COVID‐19‐associated astrocytic inflammatory signatures are regulated by canonical NF‐kB signal transduction.\n121\n, \n122\n Interestingly, neurotropism and neurotoxicity are higher after COVID‐19 infection in neurons and astrocytes expressing the AD risk gene APOE4,\n123\n suggesting that astrocytes may be a source of confluence for pathophysiologic changes observed in individuals with COVID‐19 and dementia. As outlined above, reactive astrocytes may contribute to neurologic dysfunction arising with COVID‐19 and dementias through the initiation and/or maintenance of harmful neuroinflammatory responses. Below, we consider how reactive astrocyte signaling and neuroinflammation can directly affect synapses (and EEG patterns) based on findings from the AD/ADRD literature.",
            "The complement cascade (Figure 4) is a critical defense mechanism against invading pathogens (both outside and inside the CNS) but can cause extensive damage to host tissues when chronically engaged and/or dysregulated.\n124\n As compared to controls, the brain tissues of patients who died from COVID‐19 have shown a significant increase in multiple complement components including C1q, C4d, C5b‐9, and C3. These effects have been shown to occur with vascular endothelial cells and are associated with the extravasation of fibrinogen and apparent leakage of the BBB.\n125\n These findings implicate both the classical and alternative complement pathways and suggest that C3b and the C5b‐9 terminal complement complex (membrane attack complex, MAC) may act in concert with neuroinflammatory and immune factors to contribute to the neurological sequelae seen in patients with COVID‐19.",
            "Among their many functions in brain tissue, the complement system plays an important role in eliminating unnecessary or dysfunctional synaptic structures. The essential players in synapse elimination are C1q, coming primarily from neurons, and C3, derived primarily from astrocytes. Under neuroinflammatory conditions (and elevated complement signaling), the release of C3 from reactive astrocytes is converted to proteolytic fragments upon interaction with C1q from nearby neurons. These C3 fragments, especially C3b, opsonize inactive or dysfunctional synapses leading to microglial mediated phagocytic clearance. C3 has been proposed as a primary mechanism for synapse loss and dysfunction in AD.\n126\n C3 is robustly elevated in reactive astrocytes in aging and most ADRDs and is strongly induced in astrocytes by exposure to pathogenic Aβ peptides.\n127\n In mouse models of AD‐like pathology, C3 and C1q tend to localize with synapses to a much greater extent than what is observed in age‐matched wild‐type littermates. Moreover, genetic knockdown of C3 has been shown to preserve synaptic density and improve neural function in amyloidogenic mice. Whether COVID 19 mediates synapse loss and/or neurodegeneration through a similar release of C3 from reactive astrocytes remains to be determined.",
            "In addition to releasing C3 and other synapse‐related proteins, reactive astrocytes in ADRDs also lose properties that help protect or maintain healthy synapses. One of the fundamental protective roles of astrocytes is the uptake of glutamate from synapses via high‐capacity glutamate transporters, like EAAT2 (GLT1 in rodents) and EAAT1 (GLAST in rodents). Glutamate transport from the synapse into the astrocyte not only preserves excitatory/inhibitory balance and protects against exocytotic damage, but it also regulates the delivery of energy substrates (e.g. lactate) to neurons.\n120\n Potent neuroinflammatory mediators, including cytokines (e.g., interleukin 1 beta [IL‐1β] and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFα]) and Aβ peptides arising with neuroinflammation and/or ADRDs lead to the downregulation of astrocytic glutamate transporters,\n128\n, \n129\n, \n130\n, \n131\n resulting in delayed glutamate clearance, dendritic degeneration, and synapse hyperexcitability.",
            "Glutamate transporter levels are regulated by classic inflammatory pathways, like NFκB, and closely intertwined Ca2+ dependent pathways like calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells). Astrocytes pre‐exposed to a variety of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators lead to hyperactivated Ca2+‐signaling,\n132\n which may, in turn, stop the development of synchronized neuronal calcium oscillations\n133\n and/or promote deficits in Ca2+ dependent synaptic plasticity.\n134\n Hyperactivation of astrocytic calcineurin and NFATs is a common feature of several ADRDs including AD,\n135\n, \n136\n vascular cognitive impairment and dementia,\n137\n, \n138\n and traumatic brain injury.\n139\n, \n140\n Targeted blockade of calcineurin/NFAT signaling in astrocytes prevents downregulation of glutamate transporters in primary astrocyte culture models of neuroinflammation, and in mouse models of amyloid pathology, leading to improved glutamate uptake, reduced neuronal hyperexcitability, increased synaptic strength and dendritic integrity, and improved cognitive function.\n130\n, \n131\n, \n135\n However, the role of astrocytic calcium signaling or glutamate dysregulation as contributing factors in COVID‐19 related neurologic dysfunction and degeneration has yet to be investigated.",
            "It has been well established that EEG signals measure synchronized postsynaptic neural activity and neuron networks that reflect altered synaptic functions underlying cognitive changes.\n141\n Abnormal EEG signals arise mainly from postsynaptic currents and not action potentials in the brain. Synaptic losses were observed early on in both the temporal and parietal cortexes of brains of patients with MCIs and AD.\n142",
            "Decades of literature has shown cognitive event‐related EEG potentials (averaged EEG activity related to a cognitive event such as attention or memory retrieval) correlate to various cognitive functions in healthy humans and dysfunctions in aging and mental disorders\n141\n including ADRD.\n31\n However, cognitive EEG studies in COVID‐19 patients appear to be a missing piece.",
            "A second potential common mechanism of COVID‐19 neuroinvasion and ADRD explaining the “slowing” of rsEEG activity may be an autoimmune driven response. Some factors such as proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), molecular mimicry, cross‐reactive antibodies, and auto‐antibodies may contribute to autoimmune dysregulation in Long COVID patients. The analysis of a COVID‐19 positive patient showed neurological improvement to steroid treatment, indicating that the viral mechanism could be tied to an autoimmune neuroinflammation.\n143\n A cytokine storm induced by COVID‐19 caused neuroinflammatory encephalitis via immune effector cell‐associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).\n18\n, \n45\n ICANS presents with generalized EEG “slowing” as well as clinical manifestations including confusion, short‐term memory impairment, expressive deficits, and behavior disturbances including impulsivity, emotional lability, abulia, and akinetic mutism.\n18\n, \n45",
            "It has also been revealed that autoimmune disease related encephalitis, due to antibodies acting against the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors, can lead to diverse neurological and psychiatric symptoms.\n144\n Similarly, COVID‐19 patients showed dysregulated autoantibody levels correlating with the virus severity, including antibodies against the dopamine‐1 receptor, NMDA receptor, brain‐derived neurotrophic factor, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), and acetylcholine receptor when compared with healthy controls.\n145\n Overall, the complex pathophysiology seen in Figure 4 is similarly found in AD and ADRDs where vascular pathology and neuronal loss are commonly observed. Consequently, signs and symptoms of confusion, inability to concentrate, and learning and memory impairment are concurrently found with reduced EEG signals and abnormal EEG synchrony in cortical, subcortical, and deep brain regions.",
            "Cerebrovascular injury and atrophy are signals of relative long‐term brain damage and have been linked to abnormal rsEEG activity in COVID‐19 and ADRD. A UK Biobank study investigating brain scans before and after COVID‐19 infection compared with matched controls with no previous infection showed significant loss of gray matter with (1) greater reduction in global brain size, (2) greater reduction in the orbitofrontal cortex and para‐hippocampal gyrus, and (3) greater changes in regions that are functionally connected to the primary olfactory cortex.\n146\n In another study exploring if the spatial distribution of the anatomical events follows a cortical or subcortical pattern, the authors found the epicenters of this spread may be the cerebellum and putamen.\n147\n Furthermore, white matter events were identified most frequently in the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum. The corticospinal tract is the main pathway connecting subcortical brain regions such as the thalamus and basal ganglia. Along with this, the corpus callosum has an important role in interhemispheric communication, which can lead to a disconnection syndrome and a wide variety of neurocognitive deficits.\n147",
            "To summarize the contrasts and commonalities in COVID‐19 and AD/ADRD, we built a model from pathology, EEG, and cognitive impairment (Figure 5). Evidence in Section 6 suggests that astrocytes are indeed injured/activated by COVID‐19 infection, or infection with similar viruses, resulting in neuroinflammation. Parallel changes in astrocyte reactivity are found in ADRDs. In ADRD, astrocyte reactivity is suspected to cause synaptic hyperactivity, synapse loss, and neurodegeneration. Astrocyte reactivity leads to the production of complement C3 and loss of glutamate transport, both of which can damage synapses. EEG measures postsynaptic activity in neuronal networks that reflect synaptic injury underpinning cognitive dysfunction. What we have learned in the ADRD field gives us clues to how reactive astrocytes and neuroinflammation contribute to the neural morbidities seen in COVID‐19.",
            "Proposed model: Parallel pathology underlying shared electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormality, and cognitive dysfunction in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and Alzheimer's disease/Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD). (A) Similar pathologies between COVID‐19 and ADRD. Both neural inflammation and cytokine/complement activation in COVID‐19, amyloid and tau pathologies in ADRD contribute to astrocyte over‐reactivity, leading to synaptic dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. Astrocytes are likely a primary target of COVID because of the close interaction with the vasculature. Evidence in Section 6 suggests that astrocytes are indeed injured/activated by COVID infection or infection with similar viruses resulting in neuroinflammation. Parallel changes in astrocyte reactivity are found in ADRDs. In ADRD, astrocyte reactivity is suspected to cause synapse loss and neurodegeneration. What we have learned in the ADRD field may give us clues to how reactive astrocytes contribute to the neural morbidities seen in COVID 19, for example, astrocyte reactivity leads to the production of Complement C3 and loss of glutamate transport, both of which can damage synapses. (B) EEG signals represent synchronized postsynaptic neural activity and neurovascular coupling networks measured at the scalp. Common abnormalities observed include increased slow‐wave EEG signals and network hyperexcitability in EEG of both COVID‐19 and ADRD patients. Although cognitive event‐related potentials (e.g., searching for a car as working memory target) exhibit consistent brainwave patterns in Young heathy individuals versus those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), cognitive EEG has not yet been explored in COVID‐19 patients. (C) Highlights of key cognitive dysfunctions, e.g., poorer frontal executive functions, decision‐making, reduced attention focus, and short‐term memory, along with slowed reaction times, reported in both COVID‐19 and MCI patients. Decades of literature documents that cognitive event‐related potentials underserve various cognitive functions. Although attention, memory, and frontal decision‐making dysfunctions are common in both COVID‐19 and ADRD patients, COVID‐19 patients commonly report more brain or mental fog, while spatial and visual disorientation, predominantly affecting the posterior brain regions, are more frequently observed in dementia patients",
            "Some substantial open questions remain. One question is whether there is converging evidence on spatial and frequency features of abnormal rsEEG rhythms in Long COVID patients. Another question is whether these abnormal features are specific to Long COVID patients or reminiscent of those with vigilance and cognitive deficits due to other pathological processes. Indeed, some abnormalities in rsEEG delta, theta, and alpha rhythms have been reported in patients with cognitive deficits due to AD or cerebrovascular diseases. The cause of brain fog in Long COVID has not been fully understood.\n148\n, \n149\n Similar symptoms have been observed in people living with other brain conditions (e.g., stroke, epilepsy) without previous COVID‐19 infection.\n1\n, \n150\n Several important issues are currently unresolved or understudied in COVID‐19 related EEG indicators.",
            "Fatigue, which is frequent in older adults and ADRD patients, is one of the most consistently reported symptoms of COVID‐19, both initially and after infection.\n10\n The exact source of this persistent fatigue is disputed, but it is proposed that fatigue suffered by those infected with COVID‐19 is related to the inflammatory nature of the virus. Chronic fatigue is linked to many diseases, including autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.\n151\n It is proposed that long‐term, low‐grade inflammation maintains consistent fatigue by creating an imbalance between cellular energy availability and behavioral energy expenditure.\n152\n It is contribution to EEG signals is no clear. The inflammatory cytokine storms that the body undergoes during infection of COVID‐19 create a consistent energy expenditure of the immune system, causing the infected individual to experience fatigue.",
            "Challenges regarding mixed EEG index of severity of symptoms of Long COVID were found in aging individuals, along with severe effects found in younger individuals in the acute phase of the virus.\n153\n, \n154\n Intermittent frontal rhythmic dischargers were reported as an EEG biomarker of acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in children.\n155\n Valsamis et al. (2023) reported more severe effects of EEG slowing in acute COVID‐19 subjects below age 70.\n154\n The average power spectrum was significantly enhanced in the delta band and attenuated in the alpha and beta bands compared to aged‐matched control patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with a negative COVID‐19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.\n154\n These observations raise several questions, including the main mechanisms contributing to CNS symptoms in COVID‐19 infection, which might be different in young and older patients (e.g., magnitude of cytokine storm). Another debate is whether preexisting cognitive impairment does not cause higher morbidity rates in COVID‐19 individuals, but rather those with preexisting cognitive impairment are more likely to suffer from other comorbidities that cause more severe cases of COVID‐19.\n156",
            "Cognitive functions and anxiety were significantly affected by an acute omicron infection in 2023, which demonstrates its association with nervous system symptoms (gray matter thickness/subcortical nuclear volume). Yet, there is evidence that cognitive deficits subside after some time in mild COVID‐19 patients.\n157\n However, measuring associations between mild COVID‐19 infection and long‐term cognitive deficits is challenging due to the scarcity of longitudinal data, as infection is unpredictable and reinfection rates are high.\n158",
            "There are various methods of treatment for COVID‐19. Many of the remedies for COVID‐19 include antiviral medications or a monoclonal antibody intravenous treatment. More serious cases of individuals hospitalized with COVID‐19 warrant treatment focused on different elements of the virus, including immunotherapy drugs like tocilizumab.\n52\n In the case of an individual hospitalized with COVID‐19, presenting with excessive aphasia and inattentiveness, progressing to severe encephalopathy, treatment with tocilizumab resolved neurological symptoms within 2 days.\n59\n Initial EEG after hospitalization revealed background slowing and sharp frontal waves, while the 2‐month follow‐up EEG post‐treatment with tocilizumab showed no remarkable abnormalities.\n59\n The fact that tocilizumab disrupts the inflammatory cytokine storm response demonstrates a potential treatment for neurological symptoms of COVID‐19. In the case of a 77‐year‐old female presenting with neurological deficits following COVID‐19 infection, intravenous methylprednisolone treatment resulted in a gradual improvement of speech and cognition as well as a reduction of the background slowing of the EEG signal.\n16\n These cases of COVID‐19 successfully treated using drugs offer hope.",
            "Pharmacological treatments of COVID‐19 tend to be a broad approach to treat the illness rather than specifically targeting the cognitive symptoms that result from the infection. Though not in broad clinical practice, a proposed method of treatment to specifically target these neurological deficits is quantitative EEG (QEEG) neurofeedback therapy. This method of coaching individuals to influence their own EEG frequencies has been utilized to mitigate some behavioral symptoms of other conditions.\n59\n QEEG may be a useful tool to monitor the recovery of brain functioning as it is easily applicable and repeatable over time, even in large cohorts of subjects with COVID‐19, from asymptomatic to critical illness. In using a treatment method that specifically targets cognitive function, there may be greater potential to remedy neurological symptoms of COVID‐19 and ameliorate the effects of long‐term brain fog. However, research is needed to directly test this hypothesis, and EEG studies could provide objective measurements of the integrative functional state of the brain.",
            "Age is a primary risk factor for both ADRD and COVID‐19. Age and sex made significant differences in the survival rates for COVID‐19 in Wuhan China. Deceased patients are typically older than recovered patients,\n159\n recovered patients are more likely to be male. Resting‐state EEG alpha rhythms in MCI patients are also differently affected by age and sex, as well as education attainment.\n160\n Posterior alpha sources are more abnormal in male MCI patients due to AD.\n66\n, \n161\n The psychiatric manifestations are varied between many identifying factors, such as presence of a pre‐existing psychiatric disorder, critical illness, intensive care, and systemic inflammation.\n162",
            "Fear of the disease has an interesting age effect. COVID‐19 related stress is expressed differently across sexes and is not consistent across varied populations.\n163\n Contrary to expectations, some evidence suggest that younger individuals are more susceptible to stress, and psychological manifestations compared to older generations.\n164\n Similar increases of worry and risk perception are observed in women from low‐income settings.\n165\n In contrast, there were no noticeable sex differences in instances of anxiety, depression, and stress.\n166\n Prosocial activity and cooperation are important factors influencing the adequate responses to the pandemic.\n165\n, \n167\n, \n168\n Forced lockdowns left many aging people without social structure and support, resulting in more significant cognitive decline.\n169\n This exemplifies the detriment of isolation on individuals because of the COVID‐19 pandemic.",
            "The sex or gender differences in electrophysiology of COVID‐19 infection or underlying mechanisms are not well investigated, however it is well known that gender distribution of cognitive symptoms was clearly visible.\n170\n In a study including patients with COVID‐19 infection and associated neurological symptoms, post‐COVID‐19 syndrome was found to be more common in women than men, with the most common symptoms being headache and cognitive impairment. In addition, PTSD was more prevalent in women during the COVID‐19 pandemic. In a longitudinal study on PTSD, greater Late Positive Potential (LPP) EEG response predicted PTSD, indicating that this might be useful as a marker for prevention and treatment. To continue, assessing anxiety symptoms and pretrauma LPP to emotional stimuli may be helpful for identifying vulnerable individuals before the onset of symptoms.\n171\n Furthermore, prior research suggests that gender is an important factor in hypoxia resilience. There is identifiable brain wave suppression for both men and women with hypoxic exposure, and there are significant differences in this suppression between genders, such as significant decreases in theta and gamma frequency power for women compared to men.\n172",
            "Several rsEEG studies investigated the effect of the sex factor in ADRD patients, which offers insights of future COVID‐19 related EEG studies in men and women. One study showed higher values of posterior delta and theta power in females over male patients (56–79 years).\n173\n Additionally, another study showed that in AD patients, the male sex combined with early disease onset and increased severity of behavioral impairment predicted mortality.\n174\n A third study showed that, in those patients, mortality was predicted by the combination of the male sex with the following conditions: older age, poor cognitive function, low rsEEG alpha and beta power density, and temporoparietal atrophy.\n175\n These findings agree with previous evidence showing that brains of women over men may benefit from a sort of neuroprotection related to larger normalized volumes of the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and thalamus.\n176\n This neuroprotective effect may depend on both constitutional and environmental factors and might interact with the AD‐related amyloid and tau neuropathology and/or the cortical neurodegeneration,\n177\n, \n178\n stabilizing the rsEEG alpha source activities in the normal elderly and prodromal AD females.\n160\n Finally, sex differences in astrocyte and complement C3 have not yet been examined in the context of COVID‐19 EEG evaluation.",
            "Educational level may also be related to healthcare access,\n179\n particularly for older people who experienced difficulties in accessing such services due to a lack of familiarity or skill with digital applications. Educational level is strictly related to the concept of cognitive reserve, allowing those individuals with high education attainment and whose life is typically characterized by many occasions and opportunities to learn new knowledge and exercise cognitive functions in their job and social environment to be resilient concerning their cognitive status along physiological and pathological aging.\n180\n, \n181\n The neuroprotective effect of education becomes compensatory while ADRD neuropathological processes occur, as revealed by more resilient cognitive neural systems to the neuropathological and neurodegenerative burden.\n181\n Previous results on rsEEG biomarkers in cognitively intact adults showed that early AD amyloidosis contrast the beneficial effects of cognitive reserve on neurophysiological oscillatory mechanisms at alpha frequencies\n86\n and connectivity between the thalamus and visual cortical networks.\n182\n The functional compensatory mechanisms unrelated to brain structure alterations were observed also at the prodromal stage of the disease.\n29\n Whether education will have protective effect for cognitive impairment due to Long COVID is not known.",
            "Many bio‐social factors influence COVID‐19 symptoms like ADRD, for example, genetics of an individual brain, and cognitive reserve. The effects of COVID‐19 on the brain have not only been related to general cognitive function, but also psychiatric symptoms. Both the neurological consequences of the virus and the stresses of solitude during lockdown can contribute to increased cognitive decline, particularly in those with predementia.\n169\n Recovered individuals post‐COVID‐19 infection have reported worse mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and PTSD for up to 10 months after infection.\n40\n The continued cognitive impairment coupled with persistent psychiatric symptoms could indicate a link between the effects of COVID‐19 on the brain in various areas of function. EEG abnormalities include high individual alpha frequency, cortical current source density, high delta linear lagged connectivity, and delta oscillations.",
            "The expectation for severe psychiatric symptoms associated with COVID‐19 infection would be that the stress of hospitalization and treatment causes higher rates of mental illness. However, this is not always the case. In a study that compared hospitalized and home‐treated COVID‐19 infected individuals, members in both groups showed symptoms of PTSD postinfection recovery, illustrating that the stress of ventilation and sedation in hospital treatment cannot be the only cause of psychiatric symptoms of COVID‐19.\n40\n Suicidal thoughts were also more prevalent in home‐isolated individuals compared to hospitalized individuals. In addition, depression screening showed that home‐isolated individuals had scores over twice as high as those who were hospitalized, indicating severe depressive symptoms.\n183\n Comparison of home versus hospital treated individuals highlights the impact of isolation on mental health of those infected with COVID‐19.",
            "Environmental stress associated with COVID‐19 can increase multilevel allostatic overload, which in turn increases the risk of developing AD\n184\n and other dementias.\n185\n Having to face the uncertainty of the infection in isolation contributes to fear and worsening mental state without the support of direct medical intervention that is seen in hospital treatment.\n183",
            "To the best of our effort, we could not find any studies specifically focusing on EEG markers of COVID‐19 in Black or African American participants. Lack of research is surprising since it is well documented that the pandemic disproportionately affected Black or African American individuals. African American/Black and Hispanic populations have been reported to experience higher rates of COVID‐19 infection and mortality. Differences in exposure risk and healthcare access could lead to higher mortality and infection rates.\n186\n Among the EEG research community, which strives to gather good quality data, there is unintentional bias, which can include avoidance of recruitment and retention of Black and African American participants due to common hair types (e.g., curlier) and hairstyles (e.g., braids).\n187",
            "As stated in a recent special issue in diversity in neuroscience research, there is growing evidence of racial disparities within the field.\n188\n The systemic lack of data from Black and African American participants significantly limits the generalizability of findings. This is especially concerning considering in the context of dementia as Black and African American individuals are twice as likely as White individuals to have ADRD.\n189\n Complex mechanisms can be involved. For example, the associations between APOE4 and ADRD are weaker in populations of African descent than in other populations.\n190\n However, we believe that the COVID‐19 pandemic and reverberating negative effects represent a unique opportunity for EEG researchers to commit additional efforts to recruit and retain sizable diverse samples. We also require novel EEG solutions that can better accommodate different hair types. While these are being developed, gaps still exist, particularly for dense EEG topographies (e.g., 64‐ and 128‐channel systems).\n191",
            "Neuroimaging studies have documented racial and ethnic disparities in brain health in mid‐ and late life. For example, a recent MRI study found that, compared to White and Latinx adults, Black adults showed an accelerated pattern of brain aging (i.e., cortical thickness and white matter hyperintensity volume) in middle age.\n192\n Similar studies using EEG markers can significantly add to this evidence base and thus further highlight the impacts of social, physical, and economic adversities that are often faced by individuals from excluded populations.\n192\n Unsurprisingly, these effects are purported to be higher in populations with negative social determinants of health and who face inequities.\n37\n, \n193\n Unlike expensive neuroimaging methods, EEG recordings are affordable and can be done wirelessly and remotely,\n194\n, \n195\n which indicates it to be a good candidate for reducing health disparity in rural and underprivileged populations around the world.",
            "With an aging population worldwide, the persistence of neurological effects such as brain fog with Long COVID represents a massive societal and biomedical challenge. In particular, the potential role of Long COVID as a risk factor for ADRD in older populations warrants further investigation. Growing research has focused on elucidating common neurophysiological substrates underlying vigilance and cognitive symptoms in Long COVID and ADRD risk. EEG is ideal to address these questions, as it is cost‐effective, minimally invasive, and widely accessible.",
            "Future studies should capture both similarities and differences in the pathophysiology of cerebral oscillations in COVID‐19 and ADRD. There are multiple unresolved issues that are important to explore including: (1) Determine the value of EEG monitoring of COVID‐19 severity and prediction of long‐term consequences and cognitive decline risk. (2) Investigate EEG measurements as proxy for synaptic dysfunction due to astrocyte‐microglia reactivity and pathology. (3) Establish specific EEG features closely associated with COVID‐19 disease and cognitive dysfunctions. (4) Identify common EEG features in both COVID‐19 and ADRD. (5) Evaluate EEG network features as neural biomarkers for clinical trials of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions in COVID‐19 patients. (6) Assess variations of COVID‐19 related EEG indicators in diverse populations.",
            "In this review, we try to communicate three take‐home messages. First, EEG abnormalities have potential for identifying neurological complications and assisting clinical assessment and cognitive decline risk in Long COVID patients. Second, identifying overlapping pathophysiology, such as neuroinflammatory mechanisms and astrocyte reactivity, will advance our understanding of critical pathways of both ADRD and COVID‐19 underlying cognitive and functional decline. Third, what we have learned in the neurophysiology and ADRD field provides insights as to how reactive astrocytes may contribute to the neurovascular comorbidities seen in COVID‐19. Also, it elucidates research questions regarding cognitive EEG and MCI in Long COVID that have not yet been adequately investigated.",
            "In conclusion, some individuals with COVID‐19 display abnormal intrinsic brain activity and cognitive impairments that resemble those seen in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly ADRD. The evidence presented indicates that COVID‐19 and ADRD pathologies share common impacts on synaptic and neurovascular dysfunctions involving astrocyte reactivity and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, cognitive symptoms due to COVID‐19 are underpinned by neurophysiological abnormalities typically seen in ADRD, which can be detected by routine EEG exams.",

            "Neurological symptoms are prevalent in both the acute and post-acute phases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and they are becoming a major concern for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Accumulation evidence has suggested that metal ion disorders occur in the central nervous system (CNS) of COVID-19 patients. Metal ions participate in the development, metabolism, redox and neurotransmitter transmission in the CNS and are tightly regulated by metal ion channels. COVID-19 infection causes neurological metal disorders and metal ion channels abnormal switching, subsequently resulting in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, neuronal cell death, and eventually eliciting a series of COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms. Therefore, metal homeostasis-related signaling pathways are emerging as promising therapeutic targets for mitigating COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms. This review provides a summary for the latest advances in research related to the physiological and pathophysiological functions of metal ions and metal ion channels, as well as their role in COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms. In addition, currently available modulators of metal ions and their channels are also discussed. Collectively, the current work offers a few recommendations according to published reports and in-depth reflections to ameliorate COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms. Further studies need to focus on the crosstalk and interactions between different metal ions and their channels. Simultaneous pharmacological intervention of two or more metal signaling pathway disorders may provide clinical advantages in treating COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms.",
            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified for the first time in December 2019, which was responsible for the devastating infection of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic (Zhu et al. 2020). Early studies have focused on the respiratory system of COVID-19 patients, whose pulmonary symptoms have been well described (Guan and Zhong 2020; Huang et al. 2020). However, emerging evidence suggests that patients with COVID-19 have neurological symptoms and complications as well (Ellul et al. 2020; Helms et al. 2020; Jaywant et al. 2021; Méndez et al. 2022). Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying COVID-19 neuropathology is critical for preventing neurological complications for COVID-19 patients.",
            "Metal ions are widely distributed in the brain and play a pivotal role in the central nervous system (CNS) and neuronal function. It is well known that two types of metal ions are present in human: essential ions (such as sodium, potassium, calcium, iron and zinc) and nonessential ions (such as aluminum). Metal ions are involved in the development, metabolism, redox, and neurotransmitter delivery of the CNS with a strictly regulated metal absorption, efflux, distribution and storage (Black 1998; D'Ambrosi and Rossi 2015; Kauer and Gibson 2009; Masaldan et al. 2019; McDaid et al. 2020; Scheiber et al. 2014; Thirupathi and Chang 2019). In these processes, metal ions perform as the structural, catalytic, or regulatory ingredients of proteins including transcription factors, enzymes, transporter proteins and receptors. Because of their important functions, metal ions are enormously valuable to the brain. Lack of metals is associated with various degrees of damage to the CNS.",
            "Although metals have physiological functions to the body, excessive amount of them are particularly neurotoxic to healthy nerve cells and tissues, which impairs nerve cell physiological activities and even causes cell death (Kawabata 2022; Sun et al. 2022). However, various pathological factors, such as SARS-CoV-2 infection and ischemia/hypoxia, may lead to excessive intake, uncontrolled release and metabolic disorders in metals, which are responsible for the pathogenesis of neurological symptoms due to COVID-19 infection and ischemic stroke (Alim et al. 2019; Almutairi et al. 2019; Danta 2020a; Pulido Perez et al. 2022; Vinceti et al. 2022). Therefore, metal homeostasis is important to neuro-homeostasis, which demands a precise balance among metal absorption, circulation, and storage.",
            "Metal transport relies on various metal ion channels, which control the influx and efflux of metal ions. To date, diverse types of neurologically associated metal ion channels have been identified including glutamate receptors, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, iron transporter-related proteins and zinc transporters. Under physiological conditions, these channels keep a dynamic homeostasis to guarantee the functions of the CNS. Under pathological conditions (such as ischemia and hypoxia), transporter proteins are increased or decreased and become aberrantly activated or inactivated, causing metal overload or deficiency and affecting many cellular signaling. Generally, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity are well-established factors contributing to neurological disorders, and various studies have shown that abnormalities in transporter proteins usually cause and exacerbate neurological disorders (Denechaud et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2022a). Considering the key roles of the metal ions and metal ion channels in neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19, big efforts are devoted to understand the regulatory mechanisms for transporter proteins and their correlation with intracellular metal homeostasis, especially to the downstream signaling pathways causing COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms. In this review, we summarized the latest studies regarding the metal ions, metal ion channels, and relevant pathogenesis in COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms. In addition, the strategies in targeting metal ions and their transport proteins are also discussed. Maintenance in metal homeostasis may illuminate potential novel therapeutic targets for COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Overview of this review article. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, metal ion disorders and their channels aberrations induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and neuronal cell death, ultimately leading to a series of severe neurological symptoms. Administration of metal ion modulators or their channel modulators restores the metal ion homeostasis, thereby ameliorating COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms",

            "The membrane translocation of metal ions is accountable for excitability and bioelectricity in nerves, muscles and other cells. Neurons are excitable cells whose physiological foundation is the transition between resting and action membrane potentials (Wicher et al. 2006). This transition is determined by the selective permeability of the plasma membrane to Na+ and K+ under different conditions (Khaliq and Raman 2006). In the condition of resting membrane potential, the plasma membrane is much more permeable to K+ than to Na+ in the excitable neurons, resulting in a resting membrane potential closer to the equilibrium potential of K+ (− 90 mV) than that of Na+ (+ 65 mV) (Wang et al. 1994). Normally, the activity of the transporter Na+/K+-ATPase (also known as the Na+ pump) is critical for sustaining this asymmetric membrane translocation of Na+ and K+ (Scuri et al. 2007). Upon cells excitation, the plasma membrane at the axon hillock depolarizes with the assistance of opened voltage-gated Na+ channels. Gradually, Na+ returns to the cell, further depolarizing the membrane and eliciting an action potential in a positive feedback manner (Donnelly 2013). Once neurons are depolarized, Na+ channels are closed, accompanied by the opening of voltage-gated K+ channels, inducing repolarization (Chow and Leung 2020). As K+ flows out of the cell, the membrane potential declines and reverts to near resting potential. To achieve appropriate ion homeostasis, Na+/K+-ATPase performs a fundamental role in facilitating the efflux of three Na+ and the entry of two K+ into the cell by sacrificing the energy generated by the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule to provide energy for ion exchange and substance transport (Pivovarov et al. 2018). Thus, the Na+/K+ gradient generated by Na+/K+-ATPase is the basis for trafficking of other ions, substrates and neurotransmitters between the intra- and extracellular compartments (Hernández 1992).",
            "Ca2+ is an indispensable divalent cation that functions as a second messenger in modulating neurodevelopment, synaptic transmission, neuronal excitability, and neuronal morphology in the CNS (Chaudhuri et al. 2021; Lin et al. 2019). For instance, Ca2+ exerts a pivotal role in triggering long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), as well as in synaptic information storage patterns that underlie memory formation and maintenance (Hell 2016; Neveu and Zucker 1996). Ca2+ is also able to activate protein kinase including calpain and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CAMK II), to initiate downstream pathways (Coultrap et al. 2011; Tao et al. 2021). The wide variety of Ca2+ functions in the brain is only available when the gradient of Ca2+ concentrations tightly conserved in the cells (Dixon et al. 2022; Golovina et al. 1996). The concentration of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm is at least 10,000-fold lower compared to extracellular compartments and some intracellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrion. This huge concentration gap is governed by mechanisms involving calcium channels, pumps, binding proteins, and other metal ions such as magnesium, which is considered to be a calcium antagonist (Yamanaka et al. 2019).",
            "Iron, the most abundant essential element in humans, is widely spread in nearly all tissues and organs, such as the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, spleen and brain. The absorption, circulation, storage, and regulation of iron cooperates intensively to uphold human iron homeostasis. Iron is present in several forms: functional iron that forms hemoglobin, myoglobin, enzymes, as well as functional proteins, and reserve iron in ferritin and hemosiderin (Thirupathi and Chang 2019). Being utilized by various key enzymes with its oxidation states and forming coordination bonds, iron is involved in the sustainment of normal physiological functions as an indispensable co-factor for proteins concerned with oxygen transport, cellular respiration, energy production, DNA synthesis and repair, as well as mitochondrial and immunological maintenance (Halcrow et al. 2021). Several studies have collectively confirmed that iron plays an important role in brain health due to iron-dependent enzymes and proteins, such as monoamine oxidase, tryptophan hydroxylase, and aldehyde oxidase, which are required for synapse development, myelination, and neurotransmitter transport (Bar-Am et al. 2015; Li et al. 2017; Specker et al. 2022). In addition, brain is energetically reliant on iron-dependent proteins associated with cellular respiration, as it consumes large amount of oxygen. Iron also exhibits strong redox activity and is frequently converted between divalent and trivalent states through reduction and oxidation by ferric reductase or Fenton reaction, respectively, to accommodate its absorption, transport and storage (Kapralov et al. 2020). For this reason, the distribution of iron in the brain is heterogeneous in time and space. The rate of iron accumulation in the brain varies during different stages of brain development and neurological disorders, which is coupled with oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and cell death in the meantime (Feng et al. 2021b).",
            "Zinc is the second most abundant trace element after Fe in the brain and is localized in the hippocampus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and olfactory cortex. Zinc performs a major role in DNA synthesis, brain development and neurotransmission (Sun et al. 2022). Growing evidence suggests that aberrant zinc levels are involved in many devastating diseases. For example, zinc deficiency can lead to mental health problems, growth retardation and immune disorders, while excess zinc distorts lymphocytes state and inhibit copper uptake (Chen et al. 2021; Ogawa et al. 2018; Park et al. 2020). There are three main forms of zinc in humans: free zinc, vesicular zinc, and protein-bound zinc. Most prevalent zinc in the brain is free zinc or chelatable zinc (Maret 2015, 2019). The chelatable zinc is mainly conserved in the presynaptic vesicles of specific excitatory glutamatergic neurons and is excreted into synaptic clefts with glutamate during neuronal excitation (Carrillo et al. 2020; Lavoie et al. 2011). Upon reaching the postsynaptic membrane, the released Zn2+ pairs with diverse receptors, such as ionotropic glutamate receptors, γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) receptors, glycine receptors, and P2-type purinergic receptors, functioning as a second messenger in signal transduction, neurotransduction, and neurogeneration (Chuang and Reddy 2019; Kovács et al. 2018). Increasing evidence demonstrates that Zn2+ in synaptic clefts moderates dendritic function in an activity-dependent manner via N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) (Krall et al. 2020). In parallel, Zn2+ regulates α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptor (AMPARs) with a negative feedback (Kalappa et al. 2015). It has also been reported that liberated Zn2+ diffuses to heterologous synapses for transmission spatio-temporal neural information and regulation of synaptic plasticity (Tlili et al. 2011; Vogler et al. 2020). These data suggest that strictly controlled levels of zinc are critical in neurodevelopment and neurometabolism.",
            "Copper is the third most abundant trace element in the brain and it can be found in the thalamus, substantia nigra, striatum, and hippocampus. Copper is present in various redox enzymes such as cytochrome C oxidase (COX), Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn-SOD1), lysyl oxidase, uricase, dopamine hydroxylase and tyrosinase (Borisov and Forte 2021; Robinett et al. 2019). Possessing redox capability, copper facilitates the mitochondrial electron transport chain, neurotransmitter synthesis, myelination and clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Pezacki et al. 2022). The redox ability of copper is dependent on its capacity to operate as both electron “donor” and “acceptor”. Cuprous (Cu I) can redox into Cu II and Cu 0 through the single electron transfer charge-disproportionation between the “donor” and “acceptor” (Hatori and Lutsenko 2016; Liang et al. 2022a). Upon combining with proteins to form ceruloplasmin, Cu also converts Fe2+ to Fe3+, acting as a ferroxidase that contributes to Fe homeostasis (Hellman and Gitlin 2002). Another important function of copper is to serve as neurotransmitters (D'Ambrosi and Rossi 2015). Cu is also stored in presynaptic vesicles and released into synaptic clefts when a neuron is stimulated and subsequently connects to glutamate receptors and GABA receptors to modulate the neuronal excitability (D'Ambrosi and Rossi 2015; Tanaka and Kawahara 2017).",
            "Selenium, an essential trace element, is the active center of several selenium-dependent enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (1, 2 and 4), iodothyronine deiodinases, methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase, thioredoxin reductase, and selenoproteins (Alshammari et al. 2022). Therefore, selenium plays an important role in scavenging ROS, managing immunity, inhibiting inflammation, ferroptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Genchi et al. 2023). Selenium and selenium-containing proteins contribute to the human defense system as potent antioxidants and serve an important biological role in human health.",

            "Roles of metal ions and their transport channels in the central nervous system",
            "Inflammation in the CNS, also termed neuroinflammation, is a vital segment of neurological pathology intended to repair brain injuries and restore brain homeostasis (Candelario-Jalil et al. 2022). However, excessive neuroinflammation inflicts destructive damage to the CNS (Hou et al. 2021). Mounting evidence highlights that COVID-19 causes a range of neurological symptoms by inducing neuroinflammation (Fig. 2), and the pathogenesis of stroke is also closely associated with neuroinflammation (Anthony et al. 2022; Beckman et al. 2022). In general, neuroinflammation is induced by the release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from injured or dead cells. Later, free DAMPs in the form of adenosine, heat shock proteins (HSPs), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and interleukin-1α (IL-1α) are enrolled by associated immune cells that can induce various downstream signaling pathways (Liu et al. 2021; Villadiego et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2022b). A number of immune cells, such as microglia, astrocytes, macrophages, and T lymphocytes, are activated during the release of DAMPs (Garofalo et al. 2022). In parallel, inflammation-related cytokines, interferons or chemokines including chemokine-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) are spurred to recruit immune cells, leading to infiltration of leukocytes (Gutiérrez et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2018).Fig. 2Schematic diagram of COVID-19-induced neuroinflammation.

            "Metal ions are thought to be relevant to neuroinflammation. Some pathways such as voltage and receptor gated Ca2+ influx promote a large increase in free cytosolic calcium, which causes mitochondrial calcium overload and in turn compromises the ATP production, further promoting ROS release (Bertero et al. 2021). In addition, elevated levels of intracellular Ca2+ activate various proteases, lipases, kinases, phosphatases, and endonucleases (Metwally et al. 2021; Tone et al. 2022). These toxic elements thus induce a series of inflammatory cascades, leading to mobilization of microglia and astrocytes and increased production of cytokines and chemokines (Mehta et al. 2023). As a calcium antagonist, Mg2+ can facilitate the alleviation of neuroinflammation by suppressing calcium influx via NMDARs (Zhu et al. 2018).",
            "Iron accumulation is a major signature of activated microglia and neuroinflammation, which has been observed in several neurological disorders (Lu et al. 2022). It has been proposed that excess iron activates microglia by promoting NF-κB-mediated transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Feng et al. 2021b). A recent study has further confirmed that excess irons provoke both morphological activation and transcriptomic changes of microglia using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived microglia, and this activation reduced both pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways (Kenkhuis et al. 2022). Additional studies have identified the interaction between inflammation and iron accumulation in neuronal cells. For example, Urrutia et al. have reported that the rise in inflammatory factors including TNF-α and IL-6 causes the upregulation of DMT1 and downregulation of FPN, resulting in iron accumulation (Urrutia et al. 2013).",
            "Zinc is indispensable for immune stability, and it is able to work as a transcriptional repressor, suppressing NF-κB and restricting the function of TNF-α (Foster and Samman 2012; Voelkl et al. 2018). Therefore, intracellular zinc deficiency may boost NF-κB expression and trigger deleterious neuroinflammation. Consistently, subsequent evidence has indicated that changes in immune markers, including a decrease in MCP-1 and an increase in naive CD4+ T cell markers, worsen during zinc deficiency (Lu et al. 2012). In addition, zinc contributes to the suppression of IFN-γ, IL-17 and TNF-α in immune activated T cells (Guttek et al. 2018). These findings suggest that zinc deficiency is associated with immune dysfunction and neuroinflammation. However, Kauppinen et al. have reported that Zn2+ promotes the activation of microglia at the late stage of cerebral ischemic injury, indicating the double-edged sword effect of zinc (Kauppinen et al. 2008). Therefore, the effect of zinc on neuroinflammation depends on its basal level and the different disease courses.",
            "Both COVID-19 and stroke can cause varying degrees of BBB damage, while heavy metals such as lead and cadmium are able to shuttle through the BBB and eventually accumulate in the brain, inducing neuroinflammation. It has been shown that cadmium induces the dismission of IL-6 and IL-8 from astrocytes through activating MAPK and NF-κB pathways, leading to neuroinflammation and neuronal death (Phuagkhaopong et al. 2017). In a rat model, Liu et al. have reported that lead exposure contributes to increased microglial activation and inferior long-term potentiation (LTP) (Liu et al. 2015). This might be one of the explanations that COVID-19 is able to trigger more severe neurological symptoms in patients with metal ion disorders.",
            "Oxidative stress is provoked by overproduction of ROS, which leads to oxidative damage on lipids, biological membranes, proteins, and DNA (Feng et al. 2021a). ROS are highly reactive molecules comprising superoxide anion radicals (O2·−), hydroxyl radical (OH.), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) (Knaus 2021). They are products mainly from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, mitochondria electron transport chain, and the Fenton or Haber–Weiss reaction (Wu et al. 2022). Metal ions play an essential role in the production, distribution and metabolism of ROS. There is emerging evidence that ROS are generated in mitochondria via an electron transport chain consisting of complex I-IV and mobile carriers (coenzyme Q [CoQ] and cytochrome c [Cytc]) (Nolfi-Donegan et al. 2020). Under physiological conditions, the electrons derived from nicotinamide adenine diphosphate hydride (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucletide (FAD) in the complex I and II, are transferred to complex III, and ultimately converge on complex IV, where oxygen is reduced to water (Turrens 2003). Iron is involved in the electron transport chain as a component of complex I, transferring electrons. Then, redox-active metal ions encompassing Cu+/2+ or Fe2+/3+ are able to convert H2O2 into the more harmful OH· following overproduction of O2·− in the electron transport chain, which is known as the Fenton reaction (Husain et al. 2008; Thiriveedi et al. 2020).",
            "In response to ischemic and hypoxic stimuli, the metabolism of neuronal cells shifts from aerobic to anaerobic glycolysis with the production of hydrogen ions and lactic acid (Chen et al. 2018; Tan et al. 2021). Excessive production of these byproducts lowers intracellular pH, leading to a buildup of intracellular Na+ levels through the export of intracellular H+ and import of extracellular Na+ by the Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE) (Rotte et al. 2012). Subsequently, the plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is triggered to expel redundant Na+ and transport extracellular Ca2+ into the cytoplasm (Schnetkamp 1995). Ca2+ overload can provoke mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, which further triggers ROS generation (Seidlmayer et al. 2015). Simultaneously, the opened mPTP is capable of damaging mitochondrial membrane potential, liberating Cytc and metal ions such as Ca2+, Cu+/2+ or Fe2+/3+, Mg2+ and Zn2+, inhibiting ATP production, causing a cascade reaction in neighboring mitochondria, and eventually inducing neuronal cell death.",
            "Under physiological circumstances, antioxidants are in charge of scavenging ROS via enzymatic reactions that transform toxic free radicals into less-toxic or non-toxic species, involving superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (Bai et al. 2021; Wen et al. 2021). In terms of mechanisms, SOD catabolizes O2·− into O2 and H2O2, peroxidase breaks down not only H2O2 but also other organic hydroperoxides, and GPx converts H2O2 into H2O and O2 with the assistance of glutathione (Chen et al. 2022; Rattanawong et al. 2021). It has been demonstrated that a few metal ions play crucial roles in composing these antioxidants, including Zn-Cu-SOD and Ca-peroxidase (Mohandass et al. 2021; Weydert and Cullen 2010). In addition, the enzyme synthesizing SOD is Mn-dependent (Zelko et al. 2002). When metal ion homeostasis is disrupted in COVID-19 or stroke, the antioxidants fail to remove extra ROS, ultimately causing oxidative stress.",
            "Glutamate and aspartate are the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters in the CNS and high concentrations of glutamate or aspartate lead to the damage of brain cells, referring to as excitotoxicity (Lai et al. 2014). Emerging evidence has emphasized the ionic underpinnings of excitotoxicity. K+ overload and acidosis have been reported as prodromal events in the ischemic cascade resulting in ionic disturbances (Lipton 1999). Elevated K+ facilitates the release of glutamate, thereby catalyzing Na+/Ca2+ channels linked to NMDARs and further increasing intracellular Na+ and Cl− concentrations as well as the passive influx of H2O that causes cytotoxic edema (Dumuis et al. 1993). Furthermore, extracellular glutamate can also activate AMPARs and mGluRs, a critical step in the inflammatory cascade (Lu et al. 2017; Ribeiro et al. 2017). Thereafter, NMDARs work through a single ion channel, which in turn improves intracellular Ca2+ levels. In the physiological state, Mg2+ obstructs the channel pore of NMDARs. Whereas with the release of glutamate from presynaptic sites and AMPARs activation, Mg2+ is completely depleted from NMDARs as the postsynaptic membrane is partially depolarized, resulting in an influx of Na+ and Ca2+ into the cells and mitochondrial calcium overload, further impairing ATP production (Arvanian et al. 2004; Wollmuth et al. 1998). Calcium overload in neurons generates a cascade of downstream death signaling pathways, involving calpain activation, ROS production, and mitochondrial insults.",
            "Interestingly, extracellular and intracellular zinc and copper signaling may play a neuroprotective role against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. As we mentioned before, copper and zinc were coupled to glutamate for transmission during synaptic activity (Gasperini et al. 2015; Krall et al. 2020). In the synaptic cleft, the two metals modulate excitatory neurotransmission by suppressing the activity of NMDARs and AMPARs. Other metals such as Fe, Mn, Al, and Pb also seem to engage in excitotoxicity through regulating intracellular levels of Ca2+ or related receptor activity. Nevertheless, more work needs to be done to identify the roles of metals in excitotoxicity.",
            "As a consequence of oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and/or neuroinflammation, neuronal cells will ultimately die and the death is classified into three main different types: apoptosis, necrosis and autophagic cell death. For a long time, necrosis was considered passive and unregulated. However, in recent years, specific forms of necrosis have been identified as highly regulated and are referred to as regulated necrosis, including necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, parthanatos, and cyclophilin D (CypD)-dependent necrosis.",
            "There is no doubt that metal ions play an important role in regulating neuronal cell death. Novel evidence demonstrates that exposure to excessive amounts of metals, such as Ca, Fe, Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd, leads to neuronal cell death (Gleitze et al. 2021; Lu et al. 2022; Tsvetkov et al. 2022). It is well accepted that the occurrence of ferroptosis depends on iron. Actually, zinc is also critical for ferroptosis in breast and renal cancer cells (Chen et al. 2021). It has been shown that ferroptosis is inhibited when zinc chelators are administered. Conversely, additional zinc treatment boosted ferroptosis despite the presence of an iron chelator. Mechanistically, by investigating the genes associated with zinc and ferroptosis, the authors identified SLC39A7, which encoded ZIP7 that regulated zinc transport from ER to cytosol, as a novel genetic determinant of ferroptosis (Chen et al. 2021). In addition to iron-dependent ferroptosis, a recent authoritative study uncovered a copper-dependent programmed cell death that, unlike known death mechanisms, relied on mitochondrial respiration. In this study, the authors presented robust evidence confirming copper-dependent death through direct binding of copper to lipoylated components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, resulting in accumulation of lipid acylated proteins and proteotoxic stress and ultimately cell death (Tsvetkov et al. 2022). It is still unknown whether there is a unique mechanism for neuronal cell death induced by zinc or copper. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence that metal dysregulation disrupts the CNS in various ways, including releasing excessive ROS, triggering excitotoxicity, inducing neuroinflammation, and ultimately leading to neuronal cell death (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Schematic diagram of the pathophysiology involved in COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms.

However, besides the typical respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, COVID-19 infection might be also accompanied by neurological manifestations that may persist for a long time (Ellul et al. 2020). In the period of COVID-19, patients with no previous neuropsychiatric history suffered attention difficulties, insomnia, fatigue, hysteria and delusions, even changes in behavior such as suicide (Becker et al. 2020; Ceban et al. 2022; Farooq et al. 2021; Fricchione et al. 2022; Pappa et al. 2020).

In addition, Frontera et al. conducted a prospective study on the prevalence of new neurological disorders among COVID-19 patients in the New York City metropolitan area, which showed that 13.5% of COVID-19 patients developed neurological disorders (Frontera et al. 2021).

            "Radiographic evidence showed that a reduction in gray matter thickness and tissue contrast were observed in up to 80% of hospitalized patients (Chou et al. 2021; Douaud et al. 2022).

Moreover, Khan et al. have recently discovered that ciliary cells of the respiratory mucosa and parasitic cells (non-neurons) of the olfactory mucosa are the major target cells of COVID-19, which is supposed to be the main pathway affecting olfactory sensory neurons, resulting in the sequelae of COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction (Khan et al. 2021). However, whether COVID-19 can directly infect the CNS remained controversial.",
            "Some studies did not detect viral RNAs or proteins in the CNS tissue of COVID-19 decedents although their brains exhibited postmortem neuropathology, whereas some studies detected COVID-19 virus in autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19 (Mesci et al. 2022; Pellegrini et al. 2020; Soung et al. 2022; Thakur et al. 2021). The reason for this discrepancy might be due to the differences in basic diseases and severity of infection. In support of this view, another report has demonstrated that the S1 spike protein of COVID-19 virus is able to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) in mice and enter the CNS, initiating a neuroinflammatory process (Pellegrini et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2021b). These data suggested that COVID-19 virus was capable of infecting the brain and triggering long-term neurological manifestations. Patients with neurodegenerative disorders suffer from increased BBB permeability, which potentially facilitates the neural invasion of SARS-CoV-2. Based on these reports, it is reasonable to speculate that SARS-CoV-2-induced neuroinflammation may increase susceptibility to neurodegeneration in patients who do not yet develop these diseases. Despite the emerging evidence, a comprehensive overview of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 brain infection and the consequent impact on CNS is still not available.",
            "It is well accepted that virus is able to disrupt Ca2+ homeostasis in host cells and in turn to modulate signal transduction (Danta 2020a). Although there is no sufficient laboratory data to support the direct relationship between Ca2+ and SARS-CoV-2, several recent studies on other sequentially homologous coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), have revealed the enhanced fusion with host cells via Ca2+, thereby increasing the infection rate (Danta 2020b; Straus et al. 2020). Furthermore, viruses can also seize calcium channels and pumps, such as voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), receptor-operated calcium channels, store-operated calcium channels, TRP channels, and Ca2+-ATPase in host cells to release more intracellular Ca2+ for their life cycle (Qu et al. 2022). In agreement with these findings, Chen et al. have shown that interactions between viruses and VGCCs contribute to virus-host cell fusion entry (Chen et al. 2019). Therefore, it is very likely that SARS-CoV-2 can also distort Ca2+ homeostasis when it attacks the body, which facilitates disease progression. Some highly lipophilic calcium channel blockers (CCBs), such as nimodipine and memantine, have been reported to be effective on AD dementia due to their ability to easily pass the BBB (López-Arrieta and Birks 2000; McShane et al. 2019). In particular, some CCBs have also been found to inhibit various viral infections such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and even Ebola virus (EBOV) (Chen et al. 2019). Ribeiro et al. have also proposed that P2X7 receptor may be over-activated via SARS-CoV-2-induced extracellular ATP overload, leading to an increase in Ca2+ influx and glutamate release (Ribeiro et al. 2021). As a result, severe oxidative stress and cytokine storm occurs in the brain, eventually causing neuronal death. These reports shed some light on novel strategies for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection or the neurological diseases it causes via targeting calcium signaling pathways.",
            "Zinc also exhibits a Yin-Yang role in COVID-19. Numerous reports have revealed that zinc deficiency facilitates the risk of viral infections and the development of severe forms of disease (Balboni et al. 2022; Dhawan et al. 2022). Observational clinical studies and animal experiments have demonstrated that appropriate zinc administration could counteract the disease progression (Ben Abdallah et al. 2022). For example, in a randomized clinical study, 470 newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients were enrolled and the effect of high-dose zinc (50 mg per day divided into two doses) was examined on the two primary endpoints, admission to the ICU and death. The results showed that the risk ratio for ICU admission in the zinc supplementation group was 0.43 and short-term mortality was 0.68, with additional benefits for the length of stay and the duration of symptoms in outpatients (Vinceti et al. 2022). In addition, a recent survey revealed that taste impairment was associated with the reduced salivary zinc levels in COVID-19 patients (Abdelmaksoud et al. 2021). These reports indicate that zinc should be considered as a preventive and adjuvant treatment for COVID-19 to reduce susceptibility and disease severity. Besides the transient protection of COVID-19 by zinc supplementation, its long-term effects on the CNS remain to be determined.",
            "There is evidence that iron metabolism disturbances also occur in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19-induced inflammation promotes an accumulation of intracellular iron, resulting in low levels of circulating iron available for metabolism (Habib et al. 2021; Mahroum et al. 2022). A clinical study from Muhammad et al. showed a significant decrease in serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin levels as well as a notable increase in ferritin and transferrin saturation in COVID-19 patients (Muhammad et al. 2022). In another study, iron and transferrin were reported to be associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients (Suriawinata and Mehta 2022). Even though not confirmed, it can be hypothesized that iron-related biomarkers play important roles in causing oxidative stress in various tissues of COVID-19 patients, further triggering the activation of cytokine storm, and ultimately inducing ferroptosis.",
            "The role of selenium in fighting against COVID-19 and relevant neurological symptoms should not be underestimated. On the one hand, selenoproteins and selenium-containing organisms can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection via suppressing the expression of ACE-2 receptors; on the other hand, they can exert anti-COVID-19 effects by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress, cytokine storm and 3CLPro, the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Alshammari et al. 2022). Clinical evidence showed that serum selenium concentrations were significantly higher in COVID-19 survivors than that in non-survivors (Moghaddam et al. 2020). Moreover, selenium concentrations in patient toenail samples were correlated with the COVID-19 severity index (CSI) (Larvie et al. 2023). These results suggest that selenium plays a potential role as a neuroprotective agent in treating COVID-19. In summary, long-term inflammation, BBB breakdown, and microglia activation may contribute to neurotransmitter alterations, and neuronal impairment, thus interpreting the neuropsychiatric symptoms of COVID-19. Dysregulation of metal homeostasis is involved in a range of neurological complications and sequelae in COVID-19 patients and targeting metal-related signaling pathways for treating COVID-19 infection should be performed with appropriate compatibility. Thus, appropriate drug combinations may be a promising approach for improving neurological injury caused by COVID-19. The roles of metal ions in COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms are summarized in Table 2.Table 2Roles of metal ions in COVID-19-induced neurological symptomsMetal ionsContentsMechanisms or potential mechanismsRelated neurological symptomsReferencesNa and KUnknownInducing cerebral osmotic pressure dysregulation; inducing action potential disturbanceAttention difficulties, insomnia, fatigue, hysteria, delusions, behavior changes, hallucinations, stroke, and seizures(Khaliq and Raman 2006; Wicher et al. 2006)CaIncreasePromoting virus-host cell fusion; inducing oxidative stress and cytokine storm, eventually causing neuronal deathStroke, dementia, hallucinations, insomnia, fatigue, hysteria, delusions, and seizures(Arvanian et al. 2004; Bertero et al. 2021; Danta 2020a; Seidlmayer et al. 2015)FeIncreaseInducing oxidative stress; activating cytokine storm; causing ferroptosis; causing Aβ peptides accumulation; triggering hyperphosphorylated tau entanglementStroke, dementia, seizures(Chen et al. 2021; McIntosh et al. 2019; Rao et al. 2021)ZnDecreaseFacilitating the risk of viral infections and the development of severe forms of disease; correlation with astrocyte functions; decreasing antioxidant capacityStroke, dementia, seizures(Balboni et al. 2022; Ben Abdallah et al. 2022; Dhawan et al. 2022)CuUnknownInducing oxidative stress; inducing Aβ oligomers, deposition, and lipid peroxidationStroke, dementia, seizures(Pezacki et al. 2022; Williams et al. 2016)SeDecreaseInducing oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis, and neuroinflammationStroke, dementia, seizures(Alim et al. 2019; Pereira et al. 2022; Schweizer et al. 2021)",
            "Roles of metal ions in COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms",
            "Due to the pivotal roles of metal ions in COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms, targeting the metal-related signaling pathways might be a potential strategy to mitigate the neurological symptoms. The initial thought was to directly remediate the neural metal content by giving appropriate metals or metal chelator. A recent study has shown that zinc administration may ameliorate disease progression in COVID-19 by reducing the inflammatory factor levels of patients (Dhawan et al. 2022). In another report, patients with low selenium intake exhibited more severe COVID-19-related symptoms and selenium intake below 65 μg/day might increase the severity of COVID-19 (Zhang et al. 2020). Growing evidence has also demonstrated the role of iron chelators in COVID-19. Poonkuzhi Naseef et al. revealed that deferasirox, an iron chelator, was able to save COVID-19 critically ill patients, mitigated disease progression, and improved survival (Poonkuzhi Naseef et al. 2022). In addition, deferiprone (L1) might adjunctively treat COVID-19 through binding transferrin, involving in immune response and mobilization of iron in highly inflamed cells (Poonkuzhi Naseef et al. 2022). Unfortunately, single administration of iron chelators could cause a variety of serious neuropathological consequences, such as myelinopathy (McCarthy et al. 2022). These data indicated that it was extremely difficult to master the proper timing and dosage of metals in vivo by simple supplementation or chelation, and that inadequate or excessive amounts of these drugs gave rise to insufficient efficacy or more serious side effects. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the dynamics of metal ions in vivo so as to adjust therapeutic strategies timely.",
            "With the clarification of metal metabolic mechanisms, therapeutic protocols via targeting metal ions have become increasingly diverse. One possible strategy is to target the metal ion channels. Various antagonists or agonists targeting different metal ion channels have been developed (Table 3). Unfortunately, all of them are still only used as research tools so far. Therefore, selectively targeting the downstream pathways might be another feasible option. For instance, targeting the pro-death signaling of NMDARs downstream has shown great promise in neuroprotection (Yan et al. 2020). Different downstream pathways of NMDARs have been identified, including the GluN2B-PSD95-nNOS pathway, the GluN2B-DAPK1 pathway, the NMDAR-PTEN complex, and the NMDAR-Src-Panx1 complex (Sun et al. 2015; Tu et al. 2010; Weilinger et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2010). Through developing small molecule inhibitors and interfering peptides, many experiments have shown that targeting these signaling pathways improved the neurological function after stroke and reduced the ischemia/hypoxia-induced neuronal death. Since many scholars assumes COVID-19 as a pathological model of human inflammation combined with hypoxia, analogous to the pathological features of ischemic stroke (Fig. 4), it is reasonable to speculate that targeting the downstream pathways of NMDARs also works for treating COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms.Table 3Potential mechanisms of metal ion channels in COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms and their agonists and antagonistsMetal ion channelsPotential mechanismsAgonistsAntagonistsReferencesNa+/K+-ATPaseInhibition of Src signaling cascades;

            "Growing evidence indicates that iron deposition-induced ferroptosis causes neurological disorders (Ou et al. 2022). Thereby, targeting ferroptosis-relevant pathways represents a novel therapeutic approach for treating COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms. Currently available ferroptosis inhibitors mainly focus on preventing iron overload and inhibiting lipid peroxidation (Liang et al. 2022b). A recent study by Tuo et al. has shown that intranasal administration of ferritinase inhibitors, ferritinase-1 and lipoproteinase-1, immediately after cerebral ischemia in mice reduced neuronal damage, and the protective effect continued until 6 h after reperfusion (Tuo et al. 2022). By intravenous injection, Feng et al. have revealed that tirazol mesylate, an inhibitor of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, alleviated hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in neonatal piglets (Feng et al. 2000). Furthermore, desferrioxamine (DFO), a powerful iron chelator, has also been reported to improve neurological function in ischemic rats and stroke patients (Papazisis et al. 2008; Selim 2010). It is worth mentioning that different organic and inorganic selenium compounds including methylselenocysteine, selenocystine, selenomethionine, selenocystamine, ebselen, sodium selenite, and sodium selenate are all effective in preventing erastin- and RSL3-induced iron toxicity and exerting antioxidant effects. Among them, methylselenocysteine or selenocystamine could reduce brain injury in stroke mice (Tuo et al. 2021). Due to similarity between stroke-induced brain injury and COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms as we mentioned before, it is reasonable to posit that targeting the iron-relevant pathways and applying the relevant antioxidants might also benefit the COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms.",
            "In summary, maintenance of metal homeostasis is essential for neurological function. Metal metabolic dysregulation, aberrant activation or suppression of metal ion channels, and disruption of the ion-relevant signaling pathways may contribute to COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms (Balboni et al. 2022; Habib et al. 2021; Poonkuzhi Naseef et al. 2022; Suriawinata and Mehta 2022). So far, significant advances have been achieved in understanding different metal-relevant signaling pathways, offering us new directions to combat COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms (Gleitze et al. 2021; Sun et al. 2022; Thirupathi and Chang 2019). Thus, restoration of metal homeostasis is an effective strategy to prevent neurological damage. Despite the fact that preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential neuroprotective effects of a few metallo-modulators, they have obvious limitations, such as side effects and narrow therapeutic windows. This can be explained by the fact that multiple metal dysregulation can be triggered simultaneously in complex disease processes. The crosstalk between different metal dysregulation and the downstream signaling pathways merits further investigation, which implies that any single metal modulator may require combination with other drugs. However, the application of current discoveries based on animal or cellular experiments to the clinical setting (such as COVID-19-induced neurological symptoms) requires considerable effort.",

            "There are regular reports of extrapulmonary infections and manifestations related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Coronaviruses are potentially neurotropic, which renders neuronal tissue vulnerable to infection, especially in elderly individuals or in those with neuro-comorbid conditions. Complaints of ageusia, anosmia, myalgia, and headache; reports of diseases such as stroke, encephalopathy, seizure, and encephalitis; and loss of consciousness in patients with COVID-19 confirm the neuropathophysiological aspect of this disease. The brain is linked to pulmonary organs, physiologically through blood circulation, and functionally through the nervous system. The interdependence of these vital organs may further aggravate the pathophysiological aspects of COVID-19. The induction of a cytokine storm in systemic circulation can trigger a neuroinflammatory cascade, which can subsequently compromise the blood-brain barrier and activate microglia- and astrocyte-borne Toll-like receptors, thereby leading to neuronal tissue damage. Hence, a holistic approach should be adopted by healthcare professionals while treating COVID-19 patients with a history of neurodegenerative disorders, neuropsychological complications, or any other neuro-compromised conditions. Imperatively, vaccines are being developed at top priority to contain the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and different vaccines are at different stages of development globally. This review discusses the concerns regarding the neuronal complications of COVID-19 and the possible mechanisms of amelioration.",
            "The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a disease in consideration, is described by an acute pyretic response triggered primarily owing to pulmonary tissue infection. A high proportion of affected hospitalized patients die due to respiratory collapse [1, 2]. However, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has been implicated as the causative agent in the ongoing pandemic, does not remain confined to the lungs, as suggested by various observations. Extrapulmonary manifestations reported among patients are myocardial dysfunction, thrombotic complications, and arrhythmia, thrombocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, acute kidney injuries and acute coronary syndromes, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, hepatic injuries, low sugar level, and ketosis, along with neuronal disorders, dermatologic issues, and ocular disturbances [3, 4].",
            "The coronavirus (CoV) particle comprises four structural components: S (spike) protein, M (membrane) protein, E (envelope) protein, and N (nucleocapsid), which are essential for its assembly and infectivity. The spike present on the viral surface consists of homotrimers of S proteins that are responsible for mediating CoV entry to the host cell. The entry is achieved through the contract between the spike protein and plasma membrane receptor of the host cell, which subsequently leads to catalysis, the virus-cell membrane fusion, and the release of viral content into the host cell. The M protein, comprising three transmembrane domains, provides structure to the virion, supports membrane curvature, and binds to the nucleocapsid. The N protein has two domains; both domains bind to the RNA genome of the virus and help viral replication. Viral assembly is governed by the E protein, which is also responsible for pathogenesis [5].",
            "Until 2019 end, only six CoVs were reported that could infect humans and cause respiratory distresses. Now, we have the seventh CoV as SARS-CoV-2 whose couple of strains have been reported from the UK and Africa in the year of 2020. The majority of them (four out of six CoVs) could cause only mild upper respiratory symptoms and would rarely lead to severe infection in infants, adolescents, or the elderly. The other two, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), were associated with severe respiratory syndrome among humans [6, 7]. Before infecting neural cells, CoV particles can access several routes, including through leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), vascular epithelial infection, transsynaptic transfer through infected neurons, or via the olfactory nerve [8]. However, the chances of direct endocytic infection, as established for the Zika virus and Tick-borne encephalitis virus, cannot be overruled. CoVs were predominantly found to infect neurons, besides eliciting cardiac and respiratory control in the brain stem, injuries to which may aggravate or even lead to respiratory collapse [9].",
            "Further, it is well known that primary receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a metallopeptidase, and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TRPMSS2), which is an endoprotease, form a cell surface complex and collectively operate as a portico for glycoprotein activation for SARS-CoV entry into host cells [10]. The proteins are expressed in the olfactory epithelium located close to olfactory sensory neurons along with other organ tissues, which include pulmonary tissues, renal, enterocytes, and prostate glands among others [11]. The putative expression and location of ACE2 and TRPMSS2 in the olfactory bulb suggests the strong neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2, as observed in previously reported CoVs [12]. Both upper airway epithelium and vascular epithelium express ACE2 at abundant levels, which can facilitate the entry of the virus into cells of the central nervous system (CNS). As neural cells, including neurons and neuroglia, express ACE2, CoVs can infect these as well. Once it enters the CNS, it can further disseminate using axodendritic transsynaptic tracks. For instance, in a rodent model, intranasal SARS-CoV-1 exhibited tropism toward the cerebral, thalamus, and rhombencephalon derivatives, as expected in the case of viral encephalitis [13].",
            "Recently, chronic neuroinflammation is associated with the neuropathophysiological aspects of certain neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), among others [14, 15]. In the case of AD, the microglia lose the ability to phagocytize the Aβ protein in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines or chemokines, which favors the deposition of pathogenic Aβ plagues [16]. Similarly, there are pathophysiological evidence observed in other NDDs. The cytokine storm (CS) induced as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection involves the neuroinflammatory cascade activation, similar to that observed in NDDs. Furthermore, there is a possibility that this molecular alteration may persist even after the acute infection is eliminated, owing to which the health of the CNS remains sustainably compromised. Lastly, it remains unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to remain in a latent state in the CNS like other CoVs, which may increase the possibility of sustained neuroinflammation and compromised neural functions. In this review, we discuss the neuropathophysiological complications, the mode of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS, and the possible mechanisms of amelioration of neuro-comorbid conditions.",
            "COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) is characterized by various neurological symptoms, necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, including encephalitis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, epileptic seizures, stroke, and rhabdomyolysis, among several others [17]. Other reported neurologic symptoms, such as compromised consciousness and hallucination, indicate SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection in the neocortex of the CNS [18]. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the frontal lobe tissue of a patient in transmission electron microscopy experiments [8]. Based on the above observation, it can be suggested that SARS-CoV-2 prefers a hematogenous route to enter into CNS.",
            "The neuronal complications observed in 36.4% of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, as reported in a retrospective study on 214 subjects [19], have been cited in several recent studies. In these patients, symptoms such as headache and distressed consciousness confirmed the neuronal involvement in the disease. Besides, both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes were reported in six patients, and “muscle injury” characterized by elevated creatine kinase levels was observed in twenty-three patients [20]. The authors of the concerned study hypothesized that this might be associated with elevated D-dimer levels. Such observations in the patients of ICU lead them to a hypercoagulable state. Some of the major signs of the neurological establishment of COVID-19-related encephalitis were reported in Beijing, China [21]. In addition to convulsions and persistent hiccups, there were several neurological complications, such as slow pupillary response, meningeal irritation, and bilateral ankle clonus that were observed upon examination.",
            "Another fundamental aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS is the induction of high levels of systemic inflammation with a substantial release of cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory signals, which constitute CS [22] which subsequently leads to a significant disruption of the BBB, along with the initiation and exacerbation of neuroinflammation. It has been consistently demonstrated in clinical and preclinical studies that systemic inflammation induced by bacteria, virus, or any toxic agent compromises the BBB, activates microglia- and astrocyte-borne Toll-like receptors, and damages the glia limitans [23], which are associated with innate immunity [24]. This eventually promotes neuroinflammation, which substantially disrupts brain homeostasis and leads to neuronal apoptosis [25].",
            "Hence, functional brain damage resulting from neuroinflammation could explain the clinical experience with respect to the onset or progression of behavior-associated cognitive impairments in the patients who have overcome pneumonia [26]. Neurobehavioral abnormalities such as delirium and cognitive deficits are observed frequently under conditions of systemic inflammation resulting from prolonged hypoxia and the subsequent induction of persistent and uncontrolled neuroinflammation [27]. Consequently, the condition leads to the damage of the hippocampus and cortical areas, which govern cognitive functions and neurobehavioral fluctuations [28]. Hence, CNS infection accompanied by systemic inflammation in patients with COVID-19 leads to the loss of integrity in the BBB and initiates a strong neuroinflammatory response characterized by reactive astrogliosis and microglial activation [29]. Moreover, neuropsychiatric progression and cognitive impairments, both acute and chronic, can be triggered by neuroinflammation in conjunction with prolonged hypoxia [30]. Therefore, the neurological and neuropsychiatric aspects of neuroinflammation, along with pulmonary amelioration, must be considered while designing the therapeutic schemes and rehabilitation schedule for patients with COVID-19 [31].",
            "Accumulating shreds of evidence suggest that the severity of COVID-19 correlates with the increased frequency of neurological complications [32, 33]. For instance, the association between meningitis/encephalitis accompanying significant paranasal sinusitis in patients with COVID-19 was reported in a study [34]. Further, sinusitis can be linked with viral infection exacerbated by an obstruction in the paranasal lymph vessels. The presence of a brain-wide glymphatic pathway that requires the involvement of olfactory or cervical lymph vessels is a notable characteristic feature [35]. The brain-through connection can allow the direct entry of SARS-CoV-2 into brain cells. Apart from such possibilities, there are definitive routes of CoV entry into the brain, such as across perforations in the ethmoid bone and through the compromised BBB [36]. The transmission of CoV from systemic circulation or through the cibriform plate of the ethmoid bone at different phases of viral infection has been reported to have cerebral involvement in patients with CoV infections. Based on recent observations and reports, two routes of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the CNS have been discussed here.",
            "The perforations in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone allow passage of the axons from olfactory sensory neurons. The axons form synapses at the glomeruli with the dendrites of the mitral cells in the area of the olfactory bulb, which communicates with the brain through the olfactory tract (Fig. 1(a)). Anosmia and ageusia that have been reported in several cases of COVID-19 are directly related to the involvement of the olfactory sensory system. As indicated, these neurons express ACE2, which SARS-CoV-2 binds to, and travel retrograde using transsynaptic vesicles to access the brain [37]. Alternatively, the virus can potentially travel along the olfactory nerve without entering the neuron cytoplasm. This route of invasion was established when transgenic mice that express ACE2 were infected with SARS-CoV-1 and MRS-CoV intranasally [38].Fig. 1Demonstration of neurotropism. Coronavirus in the nasal cavity can directly cross the transcribrial opening in the ethmoid bone to access the brain or perform (a) transsynaptic retrograde migration using the vesicle transport machinery used by neurotransmitters. (b) In blood circulation, the virus can infect vascular endothelial cells, which further provide access to the glial cells of CNS; alternatively, virally infected leukocytes can transport the virus across the BBB and facilitate the infection of the CNS",

            "The binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain with ACE2 was reported to be 10- to 20-fold higher than that of the spike protein ectodomain of SARS-CoV-1 [39]. Hence, the perforations in the cribriform plate can act as a definitive route for the virus to infect and affect the CNS [40]. In the vicinity of neuronal cells, the interaction of CoV and ACE2 receptors can trigger a cycle of budding viral phenomena that causes neuronal damage without noticeable inflammation, as previously observed in cases of SARS-CoV [41]. The virus can adopt fast axonal transport using axonal microtubules, which involves either retrograde or anterograde movement of molecules, to spread within the neuron. Certain viruses, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have been reported to utilize the rearward fast axonal transport for entering the neuronal body [42].",
            "The formation of the BBB involves coordination among neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells for regulating the regional cerebral blood flow, as required for optimal neuronal activities [43]. Essential macromolecules are transported through this barrier into the CNS by selective transcytosis while maintaining neurovascular coupling and hemodynamic responses to support the demands of neuronal physiological activities. The membrane also maintains the extracellular fluid in the CNS while preventing the hematogenous entry of neurotoxic compounds and microbial agents into the brain. Endothelial cells express ACE2, which makes them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can potentially lead to the deterioration of the integral architecture of the BBB [44]. The resulting hypoperfusion can restrict the entry of molecules that are necessary to maintain neuronal structure and functions, thus promote the cognitive impairment in the affected individuals.",
            "Viruses in the blood circulation possibly bind to ACE2 expressed on vascular endothelial cells, which enables them to infect and further move into the cerebral circulation (Fig. 1(b)). The tight junctions between vascular endothelial cells may serve as another point of entry into the cerebral circulation, as the leisurely motion of the blood in the capillaries could be one of the factors that aid the interaction of the viral spike protein with ACE2 expressed in the surrounding cells. There are pieces of evidence of the infection of vascular endothelial cells and the transport of CoV through this route, as shown in an autopsy study wherein SARS-CoV-2 was observed in a section of the frontal lobe specimen [8]. Vesicles in the neurons of the frontal lobe were observed to be dilated in the presence of viral particles. Additionally, electron microscopy has also revealed the process of endocytosis and exocytosis being used by the viral particles to move across vascular endothelial cells [45]. Hence, the resulting disruptions of the neurovascular unit can create a potential pathway for viral entry into the CNS and cause localized inflammatory and immune responses that initiate neurodegenerative processes. The viral particle budding from endothelium leads to the damage in the endothelial lining and facilitates the viral entry to the brain [46].",
            "Impaired neurovascular coupling, diminished cerebral blood flow, and in limbic and associative cortices are associated with aging. The disruption of the BBB in the older adults increases their susceptibility to neuro-invasion during infection of SARS-CoV-2. The long-term consequences of the disease are associated with aging and age-related neurodegenerative disorders. The aggravation of neuropathological conditions upon viral infection causes an acceleration in the onset or further deterioration of existing motor and cognitive deficits. Once the current viral outbreak is managed, our healthcare system could be faced with a high number of patients dealing with the abovementioned conditions and analogous comorbid neurological problems. Accordingly, long-term neuronal problem follow-ups in aged population adults may be necessary post-severe COVID-19 infection. Keeping these considerations in mind, the following neuronal disorders are being discussed here.",
            "Under normal conditions, patients with ADRD needs special care and are more prone to infections or diseases. Under the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the vulnerability of these patients has increased directly owing to the rise in morbidity and mortality and indirectly owing to significant changes in the healthcare system, on which they are heavily dependent. The draconian implications of this situation are not restricted to patients with dementia who are infected by the virus, non-infected patients are also susceptible, as the restriction on free movement and meeting with family and friends exacerbates the severity.",
            "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients are at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-19 infection [47]. The general recommendations for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection provided by public health authorities, such as hygiene of the hands, mouth, and nose; maintenance of physical distance; or public isolation, cannot be followed by AD patients. Owing to dementia, they may be unable to remember or understand the directions or precautions that are necessary under the ongoing pandemic. If conditions such as depression, apathy, and restricted mobility are accompanied by the general symptoms, it becomes significantly difficult for them to comply with the safety rules. Patients with severe AD who have psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia are considerably restless to be able to remain in isolation [48]. Confinement and isolation during the COVID-19 lockdown led to the exaggeration of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD [49]. The care of elderly patients with AD and related dementia who have multiple comorbidities and test positive for COVID-19 would be a major challenge for caregivers and hospital staff [50].",
            "The risk factors of AD and related dementia viz. age, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and obesity are major risk factors for COVID-19 as well, which makes such individuals more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 [51]. A report stated in Italy that almost one-third of the confirmed cases and approximately 9 of 10 deaths were reported in people above 70 years of age [52]. It is known that among people of the same age, those with dementia are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease, pneumonia, and diabetes than those without dementia [53]. These conditions are also associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection [54]. Guan et al. suggested that out of the confirmed cases reported in China until April 2020, patients in more than 90% of the cases presented with pneumonia [55]. Foley et al. stated that the rate of mortality in patients with pneumonia was two times higher if the patient had dementia than if they did not [56].",
            "The pandemic exerted an adverse effect on the global healthcare system. The functional hospitals and clinics have been converted to deal with the current crisis, and pre-booked appointments with patients have been extended until further notice. There have been reports of the diversion of health resources from patients with ADRD [57]. With respect to the medications required for treating ADRD, anticholinesterase inhibitors are used most commonly to stabilize the patients; therefore, the non-availability of the drug could affect the patients. This could be attributed to missed visits or delay in supply from the pharmaceutical organizations during the pandemic. Patients with ADRD already face significant social stigma [58], and individuals with or at risk of contracting COVID-19 have been stigmatized as well. Therefore, patients with ADRD who are at risk of contracting COVID-19 have considerably higher chances of facing social stigma and mental stress [59].",
            "The major risk factor for COVID-19 in patients with AD is the APOE e4 allele. The APOE e4 genotype is commonly associated with a 14-fold increase in the risk of AD [60]. Kuo et al. reported that the APOE e4 genotype could predict the risk for severe COVID-19 among individuals of the UK Biobank community [61]. It was stated that the APOE e4 allele increases the risk of COVID-19 regardless of the history of dementia. The gene is highly co-expressed with ACE2, which has been discussed above in detail. Further investigation on the co-expression of the two genes is necessary. Patients with dementia presenting with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 is an atypical observation, which delays early diagnosis and treatment. The worsening status of dementia should be considered a symptom of COVID-19 in such patients. This can lead to early recognition, isolation, and timely treatment of such subjects [62].",
            "With an increase in age, the inflammation increases, and a special term “inflammaging” is coined for this process. A higher current baseline of inflammation may be one of the reasons why older individuals are at a higher risk of infection [63]. COVID-19 has been known to link with “cytokine storm” which results in increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-1β), which have been reported to increase in aged people [63, 64]. Therefore, it makes the elderly especially vulnerable to extreme COVID-19 conditions. In addition to the overlapping pathology of type 2 diabetes and AD, the potential for elevations in blood glucose to increase inflammation through interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) activity may produce a “perfect storm” of excessive immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection in AD patients [65]. As a result, immunosenescence, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration are observed in the patients with AD, leading to dysfunction of microglia accumulating amyloid-beta and consequently loss of peripheral immune response [66].",
            "Another hypothesis for COVID-19 severity in AD patients is the involvement of interferons (IFN). In response to viral infections, IFNs are produced by the host body. IFNs also have a role in AD pathology, thereby indicating nucleic acid containing amyloid fibrils stimulating the expression of genes responsible for IFN production. Microglia are activated by IFN, which gets associated with the nucleic acid containing amyloid plaques, stimulating a pro-inflammatory response. IFN further activates complement cascade and leads to synapse degeneration [65].",
            "The association of COVID-19 is also reported with the enhanced pro-coagulation factors like fibrinogen, blood clotting time, and the D-dimer level, which imparts its role in the increased mortality of patients by halting pulmonary normal function. COVID-19 can also cause the stimulation of mast cells, which results in the cytokine storm in the lungs. It is also reported that mast cells are associated with the stress-induced stroke. Therefore, in SARS-COV-2 infection, via mast cell activation, the severity of the condition is observed in lungs as well as in the brain. Mast cells are responsible for the instant secretion of proteases like CXCL10, GM-CSF, CCL2, TNF-α, tryptase, and chymase, and inflammatory factors such as LTC4, PGD2, CRH, IL33, CCL2, VEGF, and histamine. This condition is also a source for creating oxidative stress, which is directly associated with enhanced apoptotic activity in cells, enhanced reactive species (ROS, NO), and dysfunctional mitochondria (MMP3). Some recent studies indicate the involvement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the activation of mast cells [67] which can lead to the release of CD40, CD40L, CD88, PAR2, UCP2&4, Ca2+, LPS, MAPK, and NF-kB from glial cell further affecting neuron integrity. The diagrammatic representation of immunological crosstalk between infected lungs and the brain, and possible neurodegenerative amelioration due to COVID-19 infection is depicted in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Immunological crosstalk between infected lungs and the brain, and possible neurodegenerative amelioration. Immune reactions are started against the SARS-COV-2 infection both in the lungs and the brain, activated mast cells release pre-formed and newly formed inflammatory mediators in the brain subsequently activating the glial cells which can lead to neuron degeneration while cytokine storm is taking place in lungs, and cytokine from lungs can reach the brain through blood-brain barrier and may further aggravate the neurological complications. Under this circumstance, the patients suffering from neurological disorders (ADRD, PD, stroke, NMD) have a high risk of developing comorbidities and may require special attention from the medical support system",

            "Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Parkinsonism are comorbidities similar to AD that are associated with COVID-19. Patients with PD and those with COVID-19 share characteristics such as age and risk of respiratory problems. This puts patients with PD at a potential risk of contracting COVID-19 [68]. The death of a 77-year-old Korean man with PD dementia due to COVID-19 with respiratory failure was reported [68]. Comorbidities like age, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes are identified risk factors for PD as well as for COVID-19 [69, 70]. The nuclei in the brainstem, which is the respiratory centers in the medulla, are affected during the early stage of PD neurodegeneration and are also targeted by SARS-CoV-2 [71]. Parkinsonism has the main histological feature of intracellular Lewy body deposition (misfolded α-synuclein protein aggregates) [72]. The suggested mechanisms of PD onset and progression are oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, calcium homeostasis alteration, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and synaptic pathogenesis [72]. Meng and colleagues reported that infections could lead to PD development [73]. Lewy body deposition is reported to be at the brainstem and olfactory lobe than substantia nigra, and we have already discussed that virus can reach both the brainstem and olfactory cortex via the transsynaptic route and olfactory epithelium. Once inside, the virus has the tendency to trigger the immune response leading to neuroinflammation [74]. Recent evidence indicates that α-synuclein can partake in the immune response and can provoke its upregulation [75]. Activation of microglia produces cytokines and chemokines escalating further the immune response causing neuronal degeneration [76, 77].",
            "Pneumonia is one of the primary causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with PD [68, 78]. Bhidyasiri et al. hypothesized that mastication and swallowing are impaired in PD progression, which leads to saliva accumulation in the oral cavity and to aspiration of salivary secretion [68, 79, 80]. With further advancement of PD, the cough reflex is inhibited owing to chest wall rigidity, which leads to aspiration pneumonia. This could form the most conducive environment for SARS-CoV-2 infection in case the patient is exposed. Patients with PD are immunocompromised, which makes them more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection [81]. As PD is an age-related disorder, immunosenescence is common in patients. Adaptive immunity is compromised in such patients, and there is non-specific tissue inflammation, which makes them highly susceptible to COVID-19 [68, 82]. High fever, a common symptom in COVID-19, could exacerbate Parkinsonism in PD patients with COVID-19 [55]. Moreover, the dopamine imbalance in patients with PD could lead to an inflammatory response, or toxin or cytokine activation [83]. Therefore, patients with PD should be carefully monitored for motor function disabilities and extended in the resuscitation period.",
            "Another hypothesis proposed by Pavel and colleagues is that α-synuclein can act as an antiviral agent in neurons [84]. As a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection like the H5N1 influenza virus, a peripheral inflammatory response occurs along with abnormal α-synuclein phosphorylation in substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons [85]. They postulated that following COVID-19 infection, antiviral α-synuclein accumulation might make up pre-existing cell-autonomous vulnerabilities, causing neurodegeneration [84]. They also hypothesized that α-synuclein clearance is also affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection by binding to ORF8, human protein trafficking molecule which impairs proteostasis and causes uncontrollable aggregation of α-synuclein [84]. There are numerous indirect effects of COVID-19 on patients with PD, which represent altered symptoms and activities and stress on the patients [86]. Complete/partial lockdown limits movement and social distancing keeps them separated from acquaintances and relatives. This exacerbates depression, mental stress, and loneliness in patients and could induce various symptoms such as tremor, gait, and dyskinesia [87, 88].",
            "On the one hand, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of complications and mortality in patients who have experienced stroke [89]; on the other hand, stroke is a common comorbidity among patients with COVID-19. The patients have to be protected further from infected individuals, which increase the responsibilities of healthcare professionals. Healthcare facilities previously dedicated to stroke-related cases, such as ICU, wards, and health workers, have been allocated to COVID-19-related cases owing to the emergency situation in the pandemic, as stated by the World Stroke Organization. There has been a significant reduction in the hospital admission of patients with acute stroke worldwide, with approximately 50 to 80% reduction in few countries [90]. This suggests that individuals who have suffered a mild stroke, who could avail hospital facilities under normal conditions, are currently not allowed admission owing to the apprehension of patients contracting COVID-19.",
            "Several mechanisms that might increase stroke risk due to COVID-19 have been identified; however, these are yet to be confirmed. Few mechanisms such as CS, increased D-dimer levels, and direct brain injury by the virus have been reported [19, 91]. In a study in Wuhan, China, the effect of a history of the stroke and other neurological problems on COVID-19 symptoms was compared between patients. The study concluded that patients with COVID-19 who had previously experienced neurological symptoms exhibited more severe clinical symptoms than those without a history of disease. The symptoms included dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, and seizures [92]. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in an 84-year-old female patient suffering from embolic stroke and non-anticoagulated atrial fibrillation, following which the patient died. It was concluded that elderly patients with COVID-19 and a stroke history are at a higher risk of death [93]. Zhai et al. described the case of a patient admitted to Hubei Provincial Hospital of Chinese Traditional Medicine (Guanggu, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China) presenting with weakness in the right limb and slight cough for 1 week. He was later diagnosed with COVID-19 with hypoxemia and excessive cytokine secretion, which led to the development of ischemic stroke [94]. Avula et al. discussed four confirmed cases of ischemic stroke and PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in another case study [95].",
            "Abdulkadir et al. studied four patients with COVID-19 who also exhibited symptoms of cerebral stroke. The patients presented with stroke and infection concomitantly. The authors reported that COVID-19 in the elderly is characterized by signs such as neuro-invasion along with respiratory system involvement [96]. Age will always remain a risk factor for both stroke and COVID-19; however, there are studies that reported the coincidence of COVID-19 and stroke in young individuals in the USA [97]. In one study, it is reported that the patients having a history of stroke are three times more prone to the risk of death [98].",
            "The exact pathophysiology of the neurotoxic effect of this virus is yet to be determined. SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be able to induce stroke by several mechanisms (Fig. 3). It could invade the vessel walls, cause coagulation disorders, or destabilize an existing athero-arterial plague or cerebral embolism [98, 99]. As previously discussed, SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through the ACE2 receptor, which is also an important component of the rennin-angiotensin system (RAS); hence, it can invade vessel walls, as endothelial cells express the ACE2 receptor. Previous studies have confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the endothelium [8]. After the invasion, it can behave in the same manner as the Varicella-zoster virus, which triggers stroke in patients. This causes inflammation and necrosis of cerebral arterial walls [100]. Viruses can also cause thrombosis, which affects coagulation, platelet activation, and endothelial infiltration upon the activation of the immune system [101]. CS, which is an inflammatory process commonly observed in COVID-19, may lead to increased D-dimer levels and coagulation [102, 103]. In the case of stroke patients, as SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, ACE2’s activity in providing neuroprotection will be hindered. The inflammatory reaction is also triggered in the ischemic penumbra owing to the dysregulation of ACE2 [104]. The main function of RAS is to maintain homeostasis in the brain, along with several involuntary functions. In the case of stroke, the brain RAS plays a pivotal role. It is activated in stroke leading to inflammatory responses which ultimately activates the downstream immunological pathways [105]. With the multiplication of viral particles, the activation of immune response results in CS, which can persuade to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [106]. Studies reported that ARDS causes cough and breathing problems in COVID patients. The risk of COVID-19 infection in stroke patients, as well as the risk of stroke in COVID-19 patients, may be very high since the evidence reflects the strong brain-lung interaction and immunological crosstalk between the two systems [50, 51].Fig. 3Mechanism of induction of cytokine storm and subsequent stroke by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor expressed on endothelial cells and enters the blood stream by endocytosis. The entrance of the viral particle, detected as a foreign body, leads to the activation of macrophages and astrocytes. This consequently triggers the release of cytokines from these cells and also from other cells of the endothelium. The cytokines eventually cause endothelial damage and capillary leak, which leads to a cytokine storm in the brain. This induces an increase in the D-dimer levels and coagulation, which ultimately lead to hypoxia and stroke",

            "With respect to the above discussion on the impact of stroke on patients with COVID-19, several recommendations should be adopted to decrease the malaise of the present situation. To provide stroke-care facilities, all facets of stroke treatment have to be reorganized for providing rapid care without infecting patients. Several awareness programs have to be conducted by means of teleservices, virtual check-ups, and acute treatment to reduce the morbidity and mortality among stroke patients during the ongoing pandemic [107]. Resource management practices should be established as rapidly as possible.",
            "We have discussed above that the risk for COVID-19 is higher in patients with existing conditions, as the immune system is compromised in such individuals, and the virus can invade host cells easily. There are several studies and case report available on AD, PD, and stroke; however, there are limited data available on NMDs. A study conducted in China reported that COVID-19 could have affect myopathies, as approximately 60% hospitalized patients presented with fatigue or myalgia [102, 108], which would subsequently cause viral myositis. Critically ill patients may develop polyneuropathy [109]. The findings from these case studies show that COVID-19 can induce NMDs as well.",
            "Guidon and Amato hypothesized that there is an increase in disease worsening and incidences in patients diagnosed with NMD who were subsequently infected by SARS-CoV-2 under the ongoing pandemic [110]. The risks for several autoimmune diseases, such as myositis; myasthenia gravis; multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy; and degenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), hereditary neuropathies, and motor neuron disease are exacerbated by COVID-19 [111]. Patients with NMDs are administered immunosuppressant drugs on a regular basis, which poses a major risk for infections of any type, particularly COVID-19. In such patients, the disease can have more severe manifestations post-contraction of COVID-19. Even vaccines are less effective in immunosuppressed individuals. The drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, can trigger toxicities such as neuropathy in such patients.",
            "To date, there are no definite recommendations for treatment management of patients with NMDs and COVID-19, and considerable research is required in this field. Close monitoring is essential for patients who are suffering from NMDs and COVID-19 concomitantly to track those exhibiting a rapid decline in respiratory function. For this, remote monitoring is necessary. Patients with NMD who are administered corticosteroids may require stress doses [112]. The system for the treatment and management of patients with NMD requires significant improvisations. Every country has released guidelines with respect to the clinic and hospital visits and telemedicine for patients with NMD during the ongoing pandemic. COVID-19 has also affected training and research in the field of NMD treatment, as the current sessions could not be conducted under lockdown, and the next session may also be limited [110].",
            "The probability that SARS-CoV-2 can remain latent in the CNS cannot be ruled out. If so, delayed neurological complications may be established due to medium- or long-term virus reactivation, causing a sequence of neuroinflammatory pathways involved with a neurodegenerative disorder.",
            "The identification and investigation of neurological signs and symptoms in COVID-19 patients are significant for designing treatment protocol against the neurological effects [19]. The First Few X (FFX) cases and contact investigation protocol designed by WHO for COVID-19 also enquire about “other neurological signs” under the section of “other symptoms and pre-existing chronic neurological impairments” [112, 113]. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the discovery and development of new vaccines, treatment, and therapeutic strategies against the CoVs. The multiple pathways, discussed above, such as systemic circulation through BBB or across the cribriform plate at the olfactory bulb, are believed to be involved in the movement of the COVID-19 virus to the brain, and resultantly, can be targeted for developing various therapeutic strategies [101, 114]. Additionally, patients with COVID-19 were reported to suffer from convulsions. However, distinguishing neurological convulsions from febrile convulsions in patients with high-grade fever may aid the development of alternative COVID-19 treatment approaches [115].",
            "Currently, numerous vaccines/therapeutics have been in different stages of clinical development. A small number of such vaccines/therapeutics have exhibited the potential and yielded favorable results in the control of COVID-19 and the associated viral load. The major goals of these vaccines/therapeutic interventions are to decrease viral load, limit disease severity, reverse hypoxemia, and provide adequate organ support [116]. In this section, the methodologies and advancements for alleviating neurological problems have been discussed along with the development of up-and-coming vaccines/therapeutics for COVID-19, the challenges involved, and the potential alternative strategies.",
            "Chloroquine and its synthetic derivative hydroxychloroquine are well-established medication for malaria and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and porphyria cutanea tarda [117]. In recent times, these drugs have demonstrated antiviral activities against HIV, Zika virus, and CoV. Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and other 4-aminoquinoline compounds were observed to prevent viral infection in vitro by raising endosomal pH after crossing the vacuolar membrane [118]. Lower pH is a pre-requisite for the fusion of the cell membrane of the virus. Chloroquine inhibits terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 receptors present on the host cell surface [119]. This alteration in the host cell ACE2 receptor leads to a change in the interaction between the spike protein and the ACE2 receptor, which is another prerequisite for virus-cell membrane fusion. The diagrammatic representation is depicted in Fig. 4a. Chloroquine interference in viral replication and host-cell entry has been reported in infections by numerous viruses, such as Borna disease virus (BDV), mice minute virus, avian leukosis virus, and hepatitis A virus, apart from HIV and Zika virus [120, 121].Fig. 4Diagrammatic representation of therapeutic strategies,(a) Chloroquine and other drugs.(b) Plasma-based therapy.(c) Cell-based therapy.(d) Chimeric antigen T-cell therapy.(e) Soluble recombinant ACE2 receptor therapy",

            "Furthermore, chloroquine is used as a non-steroidal drug to combat inflammatory response in various disorders like lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. The anti-inflammatory activity of chloroquine is primarily attributed to the dose-dependent elevation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, inhibition of T cell proliferation, and development of IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells [122]. Chloroquine might weaken COVID-19 pathology, as it reportedly elicits an inflammatory response as the disease progresses [123]. However, in addition to the positive effects of chloroquine, there are reports of undesirable effects such as QT prolongation, ventricular arrhythmia, hypotension, and other symptoms of cardiac toxicity, including alterations in the repolarization and depolarization cycle of cardiac and skeletal muscles [124]. This indicates the importance of establishing and following proper protocol while using chloroquine for treating patients with COVID-19. Even though chloroquine showed promising results in COVID-19 treatment, the absence of substantial data and the likely safety concern cannot be overlooked and should be investigated.",
            "The acute respiratory distress and high morbidity observed after CoV infection are associated with CS responsible for elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in plasma [125]. Tocilizumab, an immunosuppressive monoclonal antibody drug, has demonstrated encouraging clinical outcomes along with a favorable safety profile [126]. It is a humanized monoclonal antibody primarily used for treating rheumatoid arthritis and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It improves respiratory function, suppresses CS, and normalizes body temperature by targeting the interleukin-6 receptor. Similarly, tacrolimus and prednisolone administered at low doses inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines that worsen lung condition. Similarly, drugs used for treating hypertension, including lisinopril (ACE inhibitor) and losartan (angiotensin II receptor-blocker), were observed to upregulate the expression of ACE2 receptors, and consequently aggravate viral infection [127]. Presently, the efficacy and evaluation of these two immunosuppressants, particularly with respect to their effects in reducing secondary pathological symptoms in patients with COVID-19, are under investigation through clinical trials.",
            "Plasma exchange therapy, also known as convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), is adaptive immunotherapy commonly employed in the prevention and treatment of numerous infectious diseases [128]. For more than a century, this strategy has been employed as a therapy for treatment and eradication of diseases such as rabies, typhoid, cholera, and hepatitis, among others [129]. In recent decades, it has been effectively used to treat SARS, MERS, and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, and has shown effectiveness against certain cancers such as melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia among others. Plasma administration is a type of passive immunotherapy and has reportedly improved the patient survival rate in the abovementioned diseases.",
            "Similar results of shortened hospital stay and reduced mortality rates have also been observed in patients with SARS who underwent CPT. SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are akin in terms of virological and clinical characteristics, analogous results of lower mortality rates were observed in various studies on COVID-19 patients as well. Therefore, plasma exchange therapy might be an effective method for COVID-19 pandemic control. However, only patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and have a high neutralizing antibody concentration can act as plasma donors (Fig. 4b) [130]. Regardless, the best treatment outcome of plasma exchange therapy in SARS patients has been observed with early administration, i.e., within a fortnight after infection.",
            "However, the full scale of benefit/risk ratio of plasma exchange therapy for patients of COVID-19 remains unexplored. One of the major drawbacks of the plasma therapy is the possibility of infection advancement as well as transfusion-related acute lung injury owing to an inadequate titer of neutralizing antibodies in plasma. Apart from determining the optimal concentration of neutralizing antibodies, the dynamic variations in cytokine levels as well as a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 RNA/genomic material with respect to CPT administration (plasma shot) must be confirmed for the development of an effective therapeutic protocol.",
            "Cell-based therapies primarily aim to replace or repair the damaged tissues through transplantation or trophic effect [131]. The mechanisms underlying disease initiation and progression are generally targeted during cell therapy by utilizing stem, progenitor, or primary cell types. Cell therapy-based clinical trials using stem cells for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection are currently underway in several countries, including the USA, China, Russia, Brazil, and Jordan. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been employed in the majority of these clinical trials owing to the absence of ethical concerns associated with the less invasive acquisition procedure and the high proliferation rate of the cells [132].",
            "Additionally, isolation of MSCs can be done easily from various tissues, such as adipose tissue, bone marrow, cord blood, peripheral blood, menstrual blood, dental pulp, buccal fat pad, Wharton jelly, and fetal liver [133, 134]. Furthermore, the long-term storage potential, easy and rapid expansion to clinical volumes and the safety and efficacy of use adds to the advantages of MSCs over other cell-based technologies and makes them a popular treatment choice. While multiple clinical trials on the treatment of various diseases using MSCs are currently underway, still none has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 to date. The effect of human MSC administration in case influenza virus A/H5N1 infection was investigated in 2016; the findings showed that the treatment was able to reduce the influenza virus A/H5N1-induced acute lung injury and increased survival in mice [135].",
            "Notably, subsequent to COVID-19 infection, the production and the release of inflammatory factors by the host immune system are significantly enhanced; this leads to CS and an increased number of immune cells [136]. The release of these pro-inflammatory cytokines might be inhibited by MSC therapy [137]. The regenerative properties of stem cells and the secretion of growth factors such as VEGF, PDGF, FGF, and TGF-β also enhanced the repair of injured tissues [138]. Both regenerative properties and growth factors of stem cells curb the inflammation in addition to regulating endothelial and epithelial permeability; this subsequently enhances the regeneration/repair of endogenous tissue. Moreover, MSCs secrete various antimicrobial peptides and proteins (LL-37, defensins, hepcidin, and lipocalins) by MSCs could lead to the reduction of viral load in patients with COVID-19 [139].",
            "Accordingly, it was predicted that the intravenous infusion of MSCs and their subsequent movement into the lungs would protect alveolar epithelial cells, restore the pulmonary microenvironment, sequentially salvage lung function, and prevent pulmonary fibrosis in patients with COVID-19 [140]. MSCs do not express ACE2 receptors and TMPRSS2, which prevents recognition by viral particles and facilitates healing via regeneration of cells [141]. The basis of cell-based therapy is presented in Fig. 4c. Recently, seven critical COVID-19 patients were administered clinical-grade human MSCs and monitored for multiple responses. Albeit the patients survived and recovered after intravenous administration of MSCs; however, the adverse effects of MSC administration were observed and reported. Owing to the absence of a large-scale study on MSC administration and observation, there are no conclusive evidence reported. Therefore, a large-scale study is urgently needed for the development of an effective therapeutic strategy.",
            "CAR-T cells are genetically engineered T-cells containing a single receptor for both antigen-binding and T-cell-activating functions [142]. The basis of CAR-T therapy is the transformation of T-cells to facilitate the effective recognition of specific antigens effectively and their subsequent elimination. Initially, T-cells were isolated, and DNA was incorporated through genetic engineering methods to enable the expression of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on the surface of the cells; these re-engineered T-cells are known as CAR-T cells [143]. The graphic representation of the process is depicted in Fig. 4d. The potential of CAR-T cells for identifying antigens and eliminating virus-infected or cancer cells constitutes an incredibly promising approach and has been demonstrated in experiments showing the successful treatment of B cell malignancies [144, 145]. Similar encouraging results have been observed after the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HIV infection, and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma using CAR-T therapy [146]. As pathogen-specific T-cells have a significant contribution in controlling the progression of such viral diseases, CAR-T therapy might also have a pivotal role in regulating other infectious diseases.",
            "The process of CAR-T cell formation, i.e., T-cell extraction from the blood of either a patient or from a healthy donor, and their subsequent reprogramming for targeting virus-infected cells or the virus itself could be expensive and unwarranted for the treatment of most viral infections [147]. However, due to the dearth of other definitive COVID-19 treatment options, this could serve as a viable treatment strategy. Conversely, the use of CAR-T cells that stably express pathogen-specific T-cell receptors in COVID-19 treatment could lead to excessive swelling and tissue damage owing to the proliferation of these cells and the elimination of infected cells. Additionally, lung inflammation caused by CS has been reported in patients with extreme symptoms of COVID-19. Re-engineering of T-cells with transient mRNA transfection instead of DNA transformation may be an effective strategy for preventing tissue inflammation and damage. Transient mRNA transfection would only result in temporary CAR expression (spanning 3–5 days) and likely reduce the risk of cytokine-mediated cytotoxicity coupled with off-target tissue damage [148]. Based on this, the dosage and injection schedule of CAR-T-cells for COVID-19 treatment should be designed carefully.",
            "Apart from the approaches mentioned above, other pharmaceutical interventions for early detection of COVID-19 or effective restriction of transmission and infection are also being investigated actively. In one approach, soluble recombinant human ACE2 has been administered owing to its higher binding affinity with the virus compared to that of ACE2 receptors present on host cells [149]. This approach was aimed at preventing viral entry into the host cells. The graphic representation of soluble ACE2 receptor application is shown in Fig. 4e. Promising preclinical outcomes from this approach have expedited its progression into clinical trials. Another approach targets the inhibition of a protein involved in viral spike protein expression. The host serine protease TMPRSS2 is known to be crucial for spike protein expression in highly pathogenic human coronaviruses [10]. Camostatmesilate is a candidate drug that inhibits TMPRSS2 and is primarily prescribed to control postoperative reflux esophagitis and chronic pancreatitis [150]. In the pathogenic mouse model, it reportedly limited the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the consequent pathogenesis. Previously observed high efficacy of Camostatmesilate against SARS-CoV might also be achieved in COVID-19 treatment; for this purpose, it is currently under clinical trial [151]. Herbal and medicinal plants and phytochemicals like Caesalpinia sappan, Terminalia chebula, Calanolide A, and SP-303 which is isolated from the latex of a Latin American plant Croton lechleri are in process to see the effects on COVID-19-induced infections [152].",
            "The development of a vaccine is the safest and most reliable approach for escaping from the pandemic [153]. The scientific community from all over the world is constantly working in the field of vaccine production against COVID 19. The vaccine industry has responded on urgent basis toward the pandemic of COVID-19 for supporting the developmental vaccine program against SARS-CoV-2 [154]. There is a current situation and urgent need to open up numerous platforms for vaccine development. Some vaccines are still under human clinical trials [155] and others have been approved which are available in the market. The information regarding the approved vaccines is listed in Table 1. Some vaccines have been recently entered the clinical trial phases like Convidicea (Ad5-nCoV), AZD1222, Covaxin, JNJ-78436735 (formerly Ad26.COV2.S), and NVX-CoV2373 (in phase 3 trial).Table 1List of approved vaccines.

            "The vaccines are categorized under different genomic parts like genetically engineered mRNA or DNA containing instructions for making copies of the S protein, bacterial/adenoviral/lentiviral vector-based vaccines, and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 itself [156]. DNA- and mRNA-based platforms provide the pliability toward the manufacture process and antigen manipulation. To target the frequent mutations in the antigen epitope, mRNA and DNA vaccines facilitate to change in the antigen coding gene series in the antigenic epitopes [157]. At present, scientists are working for the licensed DNA/mRNA vaccines for use in humans. Some vaccines are already developed and show the effectiveness of numerous infectious diseases. The mRNA vaccines have also been found to restore the immune (innate and adaptive both) response against COVID-19.",
            "From the above treatment strategy, the indirect therapeutic effects would be estimated in SARS-Co-V-2 associated health issues like heart, kidney, and neuronal complications. Therefore, it is believed that neurological complications would also be sorted out with the above discussed targeted therapies.",
            "Beyond pulmonary disorders, various neurological complications have been described in COVID-19 patients, including headache, myalgia, dizziness, and anosmia, along with encephalitis, encephalopathy, necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. It is already reported that SARS causing viruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, have common genetic sequences with ACE2 receptors rapport to enter the host cells [158]. The possibility of CNS infection in patients with COVID-19 must be considered by the neurologists throughout the world. Injury to the nervous system could also result from cascade events induced by the loss of oxygen owing to lung damage, which may lead to various organ impairments. The complete process of developing a critical illness may also have a significant role for the enhancement of neurological abnormalities. The primary infection could occur in the brain stem—principally in the part that has respiratory centers and controls breathing. An infection and any possible impairment in this part of the nervous system could further magnify respiratory problems in the patients. Therefore, it remains unclear if this condition is caused directly by viral entry or if it is a secondary response to the systemic inflammation in patients owing to the deregulated immune response to viral infection.",
            "As clinical practitioners throughout the globe prepare themselves for treating the patients with COVID-19 in the predictable future, the advancement of a comprehensive understanding of the systemic and organ-specific pathophysiology and clinical complications of this system-wide disease is required. Now, it has become more imperative to identify and explain the significances of research on CoV that will help to pursue multiple aspects of this poorly elucidated disease. Concisely, the areas that seek immediate attention include interpretation of the mechanism attributed to the extrapulmonary distribution of SARS-CoV-2, understanding the virus characteristics that may augment its spread in neuronal tissues, the contribution of neuropathophysiology, the consequences of anti-inflammatory therapies on CNS, prediction of the long-term effects on cognition and neuropsychiatry, documentation of reasons that describe the variability in the management and gravity of the related neuronal ailments, and the biological and social machinery underlying the disparities in final outcomes of neuro-comorbid situations. There is also a need for universal definitions and data standards for the research on COVID-19-related complications. Collaboration among the scientists and clinicians working at regional, national, and international levels who focus on transparent, ethical, and high-quality research will definitely help the humanity to get success against the ongoing pandemic.",

            "Considering their current burden and epidemiological projections, nowadays Parkinson's disease and the COVID-19 pandemic are two key health problems. There is evidence of the pathogenic role of neurotropic viruses in neurodegenerative diseases and coronaviruses are neurotropic, with some of them selectively targeting the basal ganglia. Moreover, some authors demonstrated the longevity of these viruses in the affected cells of the nervous system for long periods. Coronavirus was detected in brain autopsies and SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from the CSF of affected patients. The marked inflammatory response in some particular patients with COVID-19 with a consequent increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines is considered a prognostic factor. Immunologic changes are observed in patients with Parkinson's disease, possibly having a role in its pathogenesis. A dynamic pro-inflammatory state accompanies α-synuclein accumulation and the development and progression of neurodegeneration. Also, some viral infectious diseases might have a role as triggers, generating a cross autoimmune reaction against α-synuclein. In the past Coronaviruses have been related to Parkinson's disease, however, until now the causal role of these viruses is unknown. In this paper, our focus is to assess the potential relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and Parkinson's disease.",
            "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common and the most rapidly growing neurodegenerative disorder (1). Its pathological hallmarks are loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta and accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein, which is found in intracytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies (2).",
            "The current global burden of PD is about 6.2 million cases (3), and it is expected that more than 12 million people worldwide will be affected by the year 2040 (1, 4). This exponential growth worldwide may be attributed to several factors (5), including infectious diseases. A recent analysis suggests that viral and bacterial infections might increase the risk of developing PD (6).",
            "The hypothesis of a viral trigger associated with the pathogenesis of PD emerged more than 100 years ago, due to the relation of lethargic encephalitis (Von Economo disease) and post-encephalitic parkinsonism that occurred after the 1918 type A H1N1 influenza pandemic (7). Until now, influenza remains the main basis of the viral hypothesis, supported by its neurotrophic properties, with preferential targets in the SN and ventral tegmental area (8); and the finding of MxA protein in Lewy bodies, which is implicated in the defense against influenza (9). In the last decades, additional viruses have been associated with both acute and chronic parkinsonism, including Epstein Barr virus, Coxsackie, Japanese encephalitis B, western equine encephalitis, West Nile virus, herpes viruses, and HIV (8, 10, 11).",
            "The contemporary pandemic, starting from December 2019 to date, of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is responsible for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is now a worldwide health concern (10). With more than 16 million COVID-19 cases globally (July 28, 2020)1, our attention is now set on the hypothetical relations of this new coronavirus infection on PD pathogenesis, its potential as a trigger for the neurodegenerative process, and its consequent impact on the epidemiology of PD. One of the elements that set off this alarm was the report of anosmia in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, but also the neuroinvasive potential of coronaviruses (CoVs) and a noticeable inflammatory reaction in severe COVID-19 cases. As we know, immune activation in the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) is a common finding in cases of PD (12, 13). Moreover, inflammation can trigger α-synuclein misfolding, aggregation, and propagation through the CNS (14–16). α-synuclein aggregation may activate microglia, favoring the pro-inflammatory response and cell damage signals, which ultimately leads to neuronal death. In this hypothetical scenario, older adults may represent a susceptible group to the development of neurodegenerative disorders, as aging might be associated with low-grade and chronic inflammation (“inflammaging”) (16), and the inability to control inflammation (17).",
            "Exploring the potential relationship of SARS-CoV-2 and PD is essential because of the epidemiological implications and the understanding of physio pathological aspects of both disorders. Our paper attempts to elucidate some of those hypothetical links and its possible consequences.",
            "Most CoVs share a similar viral structure, infection route, and pathogenic mechanism. The penetration of the virus in host cells is mediated by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (18). In addition to the severe acute respiratory syndrome, human CoV infections may manifest severe neurological complications including seizures, refractory status epilepticus, encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, cerebellitis, Guillan-Barré syndrome, leukoencephalopathy, and critical illness neuromyopathy (19).",
            "Not unexpectedly, evidence shows that neuroinvasion and neurotropism is one common feature of CoVs. Such neuroinvasive propensity has been documented for most βCoVs, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus (HEV) (18).",
            "As an example of CNS invasion, following intranasal inoculation of susceptible mice, HCoV-OC43 infects the olfactory bulb and disseminates to the hippocampus and cortex, from which it appears to spread by the trans-neuronal route to the brainstem (20). Meanwhile, Fishman et al., observed a strong tropism for the basal ganglia in the region of the subthalamic nucleus and SN in MHV-A59-infected C57BL/6 mice, with fewer signs of infection in other brain regions (21). Alongside, Arbor et al. demonstrated the potential chronic persistence of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infection in human neuronal cell lines, specially oligodendrocytes, and possibly neurons (22). Further, HCoV-OC43 RNA can be detected for over a year in the CNS of infected mice that survived the acute encephalitis (23).",
            "CNS invasion was also demonstrated in humans. Gu et al. (24) reported a postmortem study of patients who died 14–62 days after the onset of SARS symptoms. Brain edema and scattered red degeneration of neurons affected the brains in 6 of 8 confirmed cases. Moreover, the presence of virus confined to the cytoplasm of numerous neurons in the hypothalamus and cortex was confirmed by light microscopy, electron microscopy, and real-time PCR (24). The average time from symptom onset to hospital admission is 7 days, while the average time of admission to the intensive care unit is 8 days (25). This latency may represent the “window of time” for the virus to enter the CNS (26).",
            "Similar to other CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 infects cells through the interaction between its spike protein (S) and ACE2. For this interaction, protein S must be cleaved by Transmembrane Serine Protease (TMPRSS2) (27, 28). Cells expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (29). Recently, Chen et al. investigated ACE2 expression by analyzing data from brain transcriptome databases. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor was highly expressed in the SN and brain ventricles, and distributed in excitatory as well as inhibitory neurons, but also astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (30).",
            "Although there is no evidence of strong co-expression of ACE2+/TMPRSS2+ in the brain (29), Brann et al. showed that non-neuronal cells of the sensory olfactory epithelium (sustentacular cells, horizontal basal cells, microvillar cells, and Bowman's gland cells) express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Human sustentacular cells express both genes at levels comparable to those observed in lung cells. Thus, these cells could be the first to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (27). These non-neuronal cells support mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the sensory epithelium. Supporting cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 could eventually spread the virus to OSNs through axonal transport (31), later invading neurons within the olfactory bulb and then to the CNS causing inflammation (32). The mechanism of viral penetration through the olfactory bulb into the brain has been previously proposed to play a role in neurodegenerative diseases, acting as a trigger for the spread of pathologically aggregated proteins in a prion-like manner (33).",
            "In a retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, the authors found that of 214 cases, 78 had neurologic manifestations, including impaired consciousness and cerebrovascular diseases, with a higher prevalence in more severe cases (34, 35). Also, anosmia and dysgeusia are commonly reported in COVID-19 patients (36). Recently, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with COVID-19 presenting meningitis and encephalitis were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (37). The nasopharyngeal sample from one patient with meningitis was negative in the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but a CSF sample resulted positive for the virus (38). These findings support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 like other CoVs has the potential to infect brain cells (39).",
            "Interestingly, SARS- CoV-2 RNA was also detected in the feces in ~50% of patients with COVID-19. Moreover, there is evidence of intestinal inflammation in these patients (40). These findings recall the model of gut-driven inflammation in PD pathogenesis. In this model an initial infection, which directly or indirectly affects the GI system, triggers an inflammatory response, increasing the levels of α-synuclein in the gut and brain, which would initiate its aggregation (41).",
            "In our opinion, these findings support the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 similar to other coronaviruses. The ability of CoVs to remain for long periods in the CNS could perpetuate the central inflammatory response and the risk of neurodegeneration. The more or less selective invasion of the SN and basal ganglia could be partially explained by a high local expression of ACE2, resembling pathologically affected areas in PD. Finally, invasion through the olfactory bulb and evidence of intestinal inflammation in COVID-19 patients reflects on the Braak's hypothesis, and the model of gut-origin of PD.",
            "A fast and synchronized innate immune response is the first line of defense against viral infections. On the contrary, dysregulated and exaggerated immune reactions may cause immune damage to the human body (42).",
            "For example, in the SARS-CoV epidemic, cerebral involvement was related to the exaggerated viral immune response. A study reported a high ratio of monokine induced by IFN-γ (Mig), and IFN-γ inducible protein 10 (IP 10) in the blood of patients with SARS, and an increase in Mig but not IP-10 in brain tissue, which in turn seems to attract CD68+ macrophages and CD3+ lymphocytes to the sites of virus infection; contributing to brain damage (43). This effect is mediated by NF-κB. Its pharmacological inhibition markedly decreased Mig in the affected organs (44). Drugs like Bortezomib and other proteasome inhibitors possess this inhibitory potential and could eventually regulate the inflammatory response (45).",
            "In COVID-19, high levels of IL-1B, IFN-γ, IP-10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) have been detected. These cytokines may activate the T-helper type 1 (Th1) cell response, a key event in the activation of specific immunity. Nevertheless, contrasting to SARS cases, patients with COVID-19 also have elevated levels of Th2 cell-secreted cytokines (such as IL-4 and IL-10), which inhibit the inflammatory response (44, 45).",
            "Current evidence indicates that some of the COVID-19 patients present characteristics similar to secondary adult hemophagocytic syndrome, including cytopenia (46, 47) and cytokine storm syndrome (48, 49). This inflammatory cytokine storm is closely associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and extrapulmonary multiple-organ failure. Significantly high blood levels of cytokines and chemokines were detected in patients with severe cases of COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit, including IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1α, and TNFα which are believed to promote disease severity (47). The cytokine serum levels, specially IL-2R and IL-6 in patients with COVID-19, positively correlate with mortality rate (46). Ruan et al. conducted a retrospective study in 150 laboratory-confirmed Chinese patients with SARS-CoV-2. They observed elevated IL-6 levels in non-survivors compared to those with mild infection (50). Moreover, a case of COVID-19-associated acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy (ANE) was recently reported (51). This type of encephalopathy is a rare complication in other viral infections, associated with intracranial cytokine storm and a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, rather than a direct viral invasion (52). Previous studies showed that an exaggerated and dysregulated cytokine response leads to neuronal death (53).",
            "From our viewpoint, the importance of these findings lies in previous evidence indicating that exaggerated or prolonged systemic inflammation alone is sufficient to pathologically modify α-synuclein in the CNS. Moreover, peripheral inflammation may also increase α-synuclein uptake from the circulation into the brain by promoting disruption of the blood-brain barrier (54); the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier facilitates lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS, and microglial activation, which is a hallmark in neurodegenerative diseases (55). Also, peripheral inflammation may exacerbate the central brain's ongoing damage in several neurodegenerative diseases (56).",
            "Certainly, immune activation is an important piece in the puzzle of PD physiopathology. CNS immune changes are characterized mainly by reactive microgliosis and high concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Similarly, an imbalance in lymphocyte populations favors a TH1-type peripheral system immune response.",
            "As we pointed out, brain autopsies of PD cases show microglial and oligodendroglial activation and upregulation of major histocompatibility class II (MHCII). Activated microglia in the putamen expressed TNF-alpha and IL-6, remarkably, these inflammatory cytokines may also have a neurotrophic role. The expression of these factors is concomitant with α-synuclein accumulation and loss of dopaminergic cells in the SN (57). Meanwhile, Mogi et al. reported higher concentrations of IL-1ß, IL-6, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) in striatal regions in the brain of PD cases compared with controls. IL-1ß, an immune response-generated cytokine, stimulates astrocyte proliferation, while IL-6 is a B-cell stimulating factor. At the same time, astrocytes as well as microglial cells secrete IL-1ß and IL-6 (58).",
            "Baba et al. analyzed T-lymphocyte populations in patients with PD. They found a characteristic predominant expression of CD8+ T cells, depletion of CD4+ CD25+\nhighcells, and a shift to a TH1-type peripheral immune system (13). Also, Stevens et al., found a 15–25% reduction in TCRαβ+, CD4+ (T helpers), and CD19+ (B) cells compared to controls (59).",
            "A meta-analysis from 25 studies involving 1,547 patients with PD and 1,107 controls, was consistent with elevated peripheral concentrations of several inflammatory cytokines, including, IL-6, TNF, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-10, CRP, and RANTES in patients with PD (60). These changes might be associated with the inflammatory process in the brain.",
            "Additionally, various genetic loci were identified in genome-wide association studies as risk factors for PD, some within the HLA region, coding for immune genes including MHCII (61, 62), particularly the rs3129882 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The GG homozygosity of this SNP is associated with increased baseline and inducible MHC-II expression in APCs, favoring a more pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cell response (63).",
            "It is not clear if these changes in the immune system are the cause or consequence of an initial trigger for the neurodegenerative process: based on what was previously stated, the inflammatory insult associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a predisposing factor, particularly in susceptible individuals. Moreover, immunologic variations in PD patients may affect their outcome after SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "The normal function of α-synuclein is partially understood. Part of its role involves the recycling of synaptic vesicles and synaptic transmission, as it is abundant in synaptic clefts (64, 65). Consequently, the loss of its normal neuronal function could play a central role in PD pathophysiology.",
            "Current evidence suggests different pathogens as triggers of a cerebral chronic neuroinflammatory response (66, 67); α-synuclein is involved in important aspects of immune activation, specifically with the innate immune response. It may have a regulatory role in the immune response of peripheric and central neurons (68–70) and could be involved in the canonic activation of inflammatory pathways (inflammation), as well as the chronic immune response and neurotoxicity (neurodegeneration) (71). This occurs due to the overexpression of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and Nuclear Factor (NF-κB), activating, in turn, the cytokine response cascade. The presence of extracellular α-synuclein is a marker of molecular damage (72).",
            "There is also evidence to suggest that α-synuclein plays a role in mechanisms of infection responses, with an increased expression of α-synuclein in viral processes such as in Nile Virus encephalitis (73), and worse disease prognosis in α-synuclein knockout mice (74). During viral infections, α-synuclein increases, acting as an inhibitor of viral growth in neurons in the CNS by acting as a restricting factor of viral RNA (75). TLR are a group of transmembrane glycoproteins implicated in pathogen recognition and immune response, which are regulated by α-synuclein, as well as other immune mechanisms (76). α-synuclein can function as an antigen associated with cellular damage and can be recognized by TLR 1 to 4, 7, and 8. The activation and potentiation of inflammatory responses are related to TLR 2 and 3, with a magnifying effect of Interferon γ (IFN-γ) (72, 73, 77), suggesting that the activation of the immune response, could lead to a chronic inflammatory process (76, 77). Finally, one hypothesis debates that infectious processes may generate an autoimmune response against α-synuclein (78) (Figure 1).",
            "Triggering factors of the neuroinflammatory process. Aging, in addition to genetic and environmental factors, and infections of certain microorganisms, can trigger a neuroinflammatory response through microglial and oligodendroglial activation. Activated microglia adopt an M1 inflammatory phenotype, secreting proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and glutamate; factors that cause neuronal damage. In this context, astrocytes become reactive, and like microglia, they secrete proinflammatory cytokines. Many of these cytokines act on microglial cells, exacerbating microglial activation, and favoring neuronal damage. The release of TNF-alpha by microglia induces increased glutamate release by astrocytes: a detrimental event for neurons. In this context, degenerating and/or dead neurons are observed, which in turn trigger microglial activation. Protein accumulation (e.g., alpha-synuclein) is another triggering factor for microglial activation. Microglia degrades and presents components of dead cells and protein aggregates to CD4+ T lymphocytes. This, in conjunction with the release of cytokines, results in the infiltration of CD4 + T cells, which release more proinflammatory cytokines, leading to greater neurodegeneration. As a consequence of this neuroinflammation, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) becomes dysfunctional, leading to the entry of peripheral immune cells. In the periphery, gut microbiota can trigger inflammation mediated by innate immune cells. The SARS-CoV-2 virus generates a “cytokine storm” at the peripheral level, therefore, it could have a similar effect. Inflammatory cytokines from peripheral blood circulation could also contribute to BBB permeabilization.",
            "As we mentioned previously, proinflammatory events such as viral infections are proposed as predisposing factors for individuals to develop PD and long-term neuronal loss (79). Special consideration regarding SARS-CoV-2 is its capacity to induce a marked systemic pro-inflammatory response. A prospective case-control study showed that men with higher plasma IL-6 concentrations had an increased risk of developing PD (80). As stated above, this interleukin is highly elevated in COVID-19. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the persistence of high IL-6 levels in recovered COVID-19 patients.",
            "As we know, SARS-CoV-2 infects cells through ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Interestingly, Li et al. found that TMPRSS2 is up-regulated in rats treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a widely used tool to model PD, compared to control rats. This study showed that genes codifying for this protein are differentially regulated and may play an important role in the development of the disease (81). Surprisingly, in the past CoVs were related to PD patients. Specifically, intrathecal antibodies for CoVs types MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 are elevated in PD patients compared to individuals with other neurological diseases (82). However, the causal role of these viruses in PD is still unknown.",
            "Although we are waiting for a longer follow-up period of recovered COVID-19 patients, some features in the acute phase of the disease are very striking. For example, anosmia and gastrointestinal symptoms are common early findings (34, 83); and a high prevalence of impaired consciousness was observed in more severe cases (34). It was thought that its neurotropic affinity could be related to its ability to produce respiratory symptoms, with over 89% of patients in the intensive care units unable to generate spontaneous ventilation, putatively due to central dysfunction (18). Hyposmia and gastrointestinal manifestations are also common non-motor symptoms in PD during the prodromal phase, a period during which neurodegeneration has begun (84–86). According to Braak's hypothesis, these symptoms represent the first stage of PD which involves the deposition of α-synuclein in the anterior olfactory nucleus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (87). We could then presuppose an overlap in the anatomical distribution of the initial pathological process of both diseases.",
            "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is expected to affect a large amount of the world‘s population. Although we have more clarity about its acute behavior, the chronic effects of this virus are yet to be seen, since a comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2 is still lacking. The systemic inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 seems enough to set off the alarms on its potential relation with neuroinflammation, but also cumulative evidence supports its neurotropic capacity. Neuroinflammation associated with COVID-19 may be involved in subsequent neurodegeneration. Alternative mechanisms by which this virus may putatively generate long term neuronal alterations could be related to an autoimmune response against α-synuclein, which seems to have a role in immune regulation and protection against viral infections. Taking into account all this information, we believe that there is a potential relation between SARS-CoV-2 and the pathogenesis of PD. Thus, a high degree of vigilance should be kept for the hypothetical role of this virus in neurodegenerative processes in recovered COVID-19 patients.",

            "The pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is marked by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. With advent of COVID-19, which is closely associated with generalized inflammation and multiple organ dysfunctions, the PD patients may develop severe conditions of disease leading to exacerbated degeneration. This condition is caused by the excessive release of pro-inflammatory markers, called cytokine storm, that is capable of triggering neurodegenerative conditions by affecting the blood–brain barrier (BBB). A possible SARS-CoV-2 infection, in serious cases, may compromise the immune system by triggering a hyperstimulation of the neuroimmune response, similar to the pathological processes found in PD. From this perspective, the inflammatory scenario triggers oxidative stress and, consequently, cellular dysfunction in the nervous tissue. The P2X7R seems to be the key mediator of the neuroinflammatory process, as it acts by increasing the concentration of ATP, allowing the influx of Ca2+ and the occurrence of mutations in the α-synuclein protein, causing activation of this receptor. Thus, modulation of the purinergic system may have therapeutic potential on the effects of PD, as well as on the damage caused by inflammation of the BBB, which may be able to mitigate the neurodegeneration caused by diseases. Considering all the processes of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction that PD propose, we can conclude that the P2X7 antagonist acts in the prevention of viral diseases, and it also controls purinergic receptors formed by multi-target compounds directed to self-amplification circuits and, therefore, may be a viable strategy to obtain the desired disease-modifying effect. Thus, purinergic system receptor modulations have a high therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases such as PD.",

Several genes that may be involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's are analyzed, such as PGC-1α, PINK1, PARK2, PARK7 and PARK8. In the mitochondria, complex I dysfunction and the consequent accumulation of ROS are analyzed. It is observed that mutations of Lewy bodies and α-synuclein protein (α-Syn) cause oxidative stress and an increase in ROS release by mitochondria. P2X7R negatively regulates cellular autophagy triggering processes of apoptosis and ROS increase. All these factors combined contribute to α-synuclein accumulation and neuronal death and can culminate in PD.

As of May 01, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had infected 3,291,008 worldwide and caused 232,478 deaths (data from the World Health Organization). The most common clinical symptoms are cough, sputum production, fatigue, shortness of breath, and mainly respiratory tract symptoms. However, an increasing number of cases have presented with neurologic manifestations, such as olfactory and taste disorders (2), and the phenomenon requires further attention.",
            "COVID-19 is a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae (including the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV [MERS-CoV] and severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV [SARS-CoV]). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (3). As such, it was previously termed SARS-CoV-2. In the review article published in 2018 (4), researchers found that the human coronavirus can enter the central nervous system through the olfactory bulb, causing demyelination and inflammation (cultured glial cells have been described to secrete cytokines including IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-15, TNF-a, CXCL9, and CXCL10 upon viral infection). The authors of a recent article (5) investigated the mechanism of COVID-19 nervous system involvement, and they stated that similar to SARS-CoV, the COVID-19 virus exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the cells. The brain has been reported to express ACE2 receptors that have been detected over glial cells and neurons, which makes them a potential target of COVID-19. Recently, the research team in Harvard Medical School identified three main cells co-expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Type II transmembrane serine protease): lung type II pneumocytes, ileal absorptive enterocytes, and nasal goblet secretory cells (6). And the other research team used single-cell RNA-Seq datasets to suggest possible mechanisms through which CoV-2 infection could lead to anosmia or other forms of olfactory dysfunction (7).",
            "We searched the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and EMBASE databases for eligible publications from December 2019 to April 30, 2020 written in English, using the following keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, neuro, clinical, characteristics, manifestations. We also checked the reference lists of relevant studies to identify any missing publications. We reviewed the clinical researches, including case series and case reports, for neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 and organized them into tables. A confirmed case of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was defined and mostly diagnosed using the triple algorithm (epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, and laboratory or radiological findings) as a standard procedure proposed by the World Health Organization.

The seizure may cause by cytokines storm, severely illed condition, or the brain parenchyma involvement, especially the mesial temporal lobe. Altered mental status may be a consequence of multiple organ failure, severe infection, or brainstem involvement. Headache is caused by meningeal irritation.",

Between March 25 and May 01, 48 cases in 213 patients (22.5%) had olfactory or taste disorders. In the beginning, most COVID-19 patients had a contact history related to Wuhan. But after the government of China locked down many big cities, Taiwan's COVID-19 cases mostly originated from travelers from Europe, the Middle East, or the United States. Besides, according to 88 cases series (see Supplementary Tables 1, 2) in China (from December 2019 to April 25, 2020), only one study (2) conducted by neurologists in Wuhan reported olfactory or taste disorder.",
            "On the other hand, an Italian researcher reported that 33.9% of COVID-19 patients in Italy experienced this problem (8). In the Middle East, researchers in Iran found a surge in the outbreak of olfactory dysfunction during the COVID-19 epidemic (based on an online checklist of 10,069 voluntary cases between March 12 and 17, 2020) (48). The different incidence of the olfactory and/or taste dysfunction by the timing and geographic distribution might reveal important information that the virus may carry the potential to alter its affinity to the central nervous system (49–51). However, the possibilities of a higher detection rate of olfactory dysfunction in patients diagnosed by certain sub-specialists, such as neurologists (2) or otolaryngologists, cannot be completely excluded. For example, the study conducted by otolaryngologists (17) found olfactory/taste disorders in more than 80% of the patients.",
            "Fever is generally known as an elevation in body temperature caused by a cytokine-induced upward displacement of the set point of the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center. Small elevations in body temperature appear to enhance immune function and inhibit pathogen growth (52). In 2005, pathologists in Beijing performed autopsies of SARS patients and found signals of the SARS viral genome detected in numerous neurons in the hypothalamus (53). As a result, it is conceivable that fever may be caused mainly by the effect of cytokines or possible direct viral invasion to the hypothalamus.",
            "Concerning seizure in viral infection, generally the paroxysmal spell may be a consequence of multiple complications of systemic disease, such as metabolic disturbances, hypoxia, etc. Considering the viral encephalitis, it frequently manifests with seizures in its acute phase (54). The most widely reported virus was HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus), which involves the highly epileptogenic mesial temporal lobe structures, including the hippocampus (54). In the two case reports (37, 39), both had mesial temporal lobe involvement (one by acute inflammation, one by previous ischemic stroke). Since the case number is limited, we can only speculate that seizures may be caused by the generalized poor condition, cytokine storm (55), or mesial temporal lobe involvement in severe COVID-19 patients.",
            "Several countries are currently encountering a crisis of ventilator shortage. The respiratory failure of COVID-19 infected patients may be partly related to brainstem failure. The COVID-19 virus passes into the cell via the ACE2 receptor (5). ACE2 is expressed in the brain and is mainly found in the brainstem, specifically in the nuclei associated with cardio-respiratory control (56, 57). In the previous research on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-COV, the brainstem was severely infected, which possibly contributes to the degradation and failure of respiratory centers (45). Besides, the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), which is responsible for human consciousness, also originates from the brainstem (and then advances into the thalamus and cortex) (58). This may partly explain the altered mental status of COVID-19 patients. However, the maintenance of consciousness is complex. Considering many COVID-19 patients were severely ill with multi-organ failure, both the cytokine effect and systemic impact of organ dysfunction can also lead to the consciousness disturbance.",
            "Both dizziness and headache are considered to be general non-specific symptoms. Etiologies attributed to infectious causes are important secondary causes of headache (59). It is known that cytokines induced by viral infection increase the permeability of vessels. This causes cerebral swelling and meningeal irritation. The meningeal irritation stimulates the trigeminal nerve terminals and triggers pain sensation (60).",
            "Ischemic stroke also occurs in COVID-19 patients because the infection may cause D-dimer elevation, thrombocytopenia, and hypercoagulable state (61–66). Besides, the exaggerated systemic inflammation or a “cytokine storm” (55), cardioembolism from virus-related cardiac injury (67) could further increase the risk of stroke (68).",
            "Most cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome appeared with a lag time from the primary infection of COVID-19 (33, 34); the pathogenesis is therefore likely to be postinfectious immune-mediated.",
            "This review is obviously constrained by the current information and limited reports. And there was considerable heterogeneity in the data. In addition, the researches of the novel pandemic emerge fastly. We could only review the results up to April 30, 2020 in this regard. The cause of neurologic manifestation may be a cytokine storm, multiple organ failure, or direct viral infection. However, the detailed pathophysiology of causing COVID-19 nervous system involvement remains to be elucidated. We sincerely hope the review can help the first line clinicians identify the emerging neurologic manifestations when combating the viral pandemic.",

            "Accumulating evidence points toward a very high prevalence of prolonged neurological symptoms among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors. To date, there are no solidified criteria for ‘long-COVID’ diagnosis. Nevertheless, ‘long-COVID’ is conceptualized as a multi-organ disorder with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that may be indicative of underlying pulmonary, cardiovascular, endocrine, hematologic, renal, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, immunological, psychiatric, or neurological disease. Involvement of the central or peripheral nervous system is noted in more than one-third of patients with antecedent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, while an approximately threefold higher incidence of neurological symptoms is recorded in observational studies including patient-reported data. The most frequent neurological manifestations of ‘long-COVID’ encompass fatigue; ‘brain fog’; headache; cognitive impairment; sleep, mood, smell, or taste disorders; myalgias; sensorimotor deficits; and dysautonomia. Although very limited evidence exists to date on the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in the manifestation of ‘long-COVID’, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress processes are thought to prevail in propagating neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae. In this narrative review, we sought to present a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of clinical features, risk factors, and pathophysiological processes of neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae. Moreover, we propose diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms that may aid in the prompt recognition and management of underlying causes of neurological symptoms that persist beyond the resolution of acute COVID-19. Furthermore, as causal treatments for ‘long-COVID’ are currently unavailable, we propose therapeutic approaches for symptom-oriented management of neurological ‘long-COVID’ symptoms. In addition, we emphasize that collaborative research initiatives are urgently needed to expedite the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies for neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae.",
            "Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it has become evident that the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) would have immense repercussions on healthcare systems and socioeconomic structures worldwide.\n1\n Besides the exorbitant death toll of the pandemic across the globe, with the rising number of COVID-19 survivors, increasing attention has been drawn to the prolonged or late-onset sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are colloquially referred to as ‘long-COVID’ syndrome.2,3 The term ‘long-COVID’ was, in fact, first coined and disseminated through social media by patients, who, already during the first months of the pandemic, acknowledged a more complex disease course than laid out in early reports from Wuhan.4,5 Subsequently, cognate terms were introduced,6–8 including ‘long-haul’,9,10 ‘post-COVID’,11,12 ‘post-acute COVID syndrome (PACS)’,\n13\n and ‘post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC)’,\n14\n to refer to persistent symptoms and/or delayed or long-term complications beyond acute COVID-19 (Table 1).\n13\n Currently, despite the emergence of new variants, following the implementation of mass vaccination campaigns, many countries have witnessed significant decreases in the number of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.15,16 Nonetheless, although cautious optimism has been expressed for the beginning of the end of the pandemic, concerns have been raised that ‘long-COVID’ could comprise a ‘next public health disaster in the making’.\n9",
            "Alternative definitions of ‘long-COVID’ syndrome.",
            "Consequently, prevention of ‘long-COVID’ ranks very high on the public health agenda. Currently, however, there is only scant understanding of the underlying processes implicated in the pathogenesis of ‘long-COVID’ syndrome, a fact that is also reflected in the tentative definitions and preliminary classification schemes proposed by national and international health organizations.13,17,19 To enable better documentation and characterization of ‘long-COVID’, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently assigned an emergency use International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code (U09.9) referring to ‘Post-COVID conditions, unspecified’.\n20\n In addition, a clinical case definition was proposed by the WHO based on Delphi consensus, suggesting that ‘post COVID-19 occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis’. According to this definition,Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction but also others, and generally have an impact on everyday functioning. Symptoms may be of new onset following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness, may fluctuate or relapse over time.\n18",
            "Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction but also others, and generally have an impact on everyday functioning. Symptoms may be of new onset following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness, may fluctuate or relapse over time.\n18",
            "Several limitations of this definition have been acknowledged, so far, including difficulties in approaching the diagnostic ‘time-windows‘ (especially in asymptomatic patients), the lack of robust clinical data to define clinical ‘cut-offs’, and the low specificity of proposed diagnostic criteria. Nevertheless, as more refined diagnostic criteria for ‘long-COVID’ are still underway, there is current consensus that the exclusion of acute COVID-19 should be regarded as a prerequisite for ‘long-COVID’ diagnosis.\n13",
            "Neurological manifestations comprise one of the many facets of ‘long-COVID’ syndrome.\n21\n In accord with the aforementioned definitions of ‘long-COVID’, the long-term or late-onset neurological sequelae of COVID-19 should be distinguished from the well-characterized acute neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection5,22–24 Moreover, as ‘long-COVID’ is conceptualized as a multi-organ disease, central nervous system (CNS) and/or peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement may present alone or in conjunction with pulmonary, cardiovascular, psychiatric, endocrine, hematologic, renal, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, or immunological symptoms.13,25 Similar to WHO, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has linked ‘long-COVID’ to symptoms such as ‘fatigue, shortness of breath, “brain fog”, sleep disorders, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, and depression’, thereby acknowledging neurological symptoms as core aspects of ‘long-COVID’.\n26\n Moreover, recent reports indicate an extremely high prevalence of long-term neurological manifestations among COVID-19 survivors, with nearly one-third of patients being diagnosed with neurological or psychiatric illnesses in the first 6 months following acute COVID-19.\n27",
            "At present, neurologists are daily confronted with an increased demand for ‘long-COVID’ patient care. Yet, as scarce evidence has been consolidated so far, diagnosing and managing neurological complications of ‘long-COVID’ calls for navigation in ‘uncharted waters’. The aim of the present narrative review is thus to provide a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of the long-term neurological sequelae of COVID-19, along with a methodological framework for a systematic diagnostic approach and management of patients with neurological manifestations of ‘long-COVID’ syndrome.",
            "We performed a comprehensive literature search in SCOPUS, Embase, Google Scholar, and LitCOVID\n28\n (that includes all COVID-19-related articles published in PubMed and Medline) up to 10 December 2021, using the following terms in combination: ‘long COVID’, ‘post COVID’, ‘long haul’, ‘chronic COVID’, ‘post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2’, ‘PASC’, ‘post-acute COVID syndrome’, ‘PACS’, ‘persisting COVID’, ‘COVID complications’, ‘SARS-CoV-2 complications’, or ‘lingering COVID’. We also searched manually the reference lists of all relevant articles. Both English and foreign language articles were reviewed. The initial literature search was performed by three independent authors (M-IS, LP, and EB). Duplicate publications were excluded from further evaluation (including duplicates from databases with overlapping records). Given the lack of standardized definitions for ‘long-COVID’ syndrome at the time of publication of most retrieved articles, all studies reporting new, recurrent, or persistent neurological symptoms following acute COVID-19 were considered eligible for inclusion. We included peer-reviewed, case-control, population-based, cohort studies or clinical trials in humans, as well as systematic reviews and guidelines, while thematically irrelevant studies, animal studies, editorials, commentaries, case reports, and preprints were excluded. Screening was performed based on title or abstract from three reviewers (M-IS, LP, and EB) and any disagreements were resolved via consensus or discussion with the corresponding author (GT). Structured reports of identified studies were extracted to include author names, title, abstract, study type, year or publication, and journal. To evaluate the relevance and strength of the evidence provided by identified studies and their potential contribution to the present narrative review, an expert panel was formed, consisting of (a) senior neurologists (M-IS, LP, EB, MP, GPP, NG, CK, and SG), with expertise in neurological complications of COVID-19, including neurovascular (CK, GT, NG, and SG), PNS (MP), and neurodegenerative sequelae (GPP); (b) senior psychiatrists with expertise in cognitive impairment and psychiatric complications of COVID-19 (NS and ER); (c) experts in internal and respiratory medicine (EB and MG); and (d) public or population health researchers and accredited experts in COVID-19 and ‘long-COVID’ syndrome (EB, ST, and MG). Evidence synthesis was based on expert recommendation to include articles from the generated databases, while studies were evaluated based on reporting of relevant primary data, validity of the methods used, and novelty and clarity of the results. Given the nonsystematic nature of the present review, panel members were allowed to adjudicate on quality and relevance of recommended studies in their domains of expertise, prioritizing research that was considered of high quality, most pertinent, and insightful. The generated database following duplicate removal included 38,402 publications, which were assessed based on extracted data by the expert panel. Of these, 147 full publications were selected for inclusion in the present narrative review.",
            "A wide array of neurological manifestations, involving both the CNS and PNS, have been described in the context of ‘long-COVID’ syndrome (Table 2). It is important to emphasize, however, that neurological symptoms are often inextricable from ‘long-COVID’ manifestations that involve other organ systems, while nonspecific symptoms, including fatigue, ‘brain fog’, postexertional malaise, and sleep disorders, may comprise epiphenomena of underlying respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, renal, hematologic, autoimmune, or psychiatric diseases.8,25,29 As novel evidence continues to emerge, the spectrum of clinical characteristics of ‘long-COVID’ continues to widen. With respect to neurological manifestations, however, there is only scarce epidemiological evidence to date on the incidence of neurological disorders in populations with antecedent SARS-CoV-2 infection.30,31 Conversely, there are abundant data from observational studies, including evidence from patient-led research,32,33 reporting highly variable prevalence estimates of diverse neurological symptoms among ‘long-COVID’ patients.34–38 Due to inherent methodological caveats of most so-far published studies, including selection and reporting biases, lack of standardized neurological assessment, and lack of adjustment for comorbidities or concomitant ‘long-COVID’ manifestations in other organ systems, particular caution is warranted when attempting to characterize neurological sequelae of ‘long-COVID’.",
            "Neurological manifestations of ‘long-COVID’ syndrome, according to the localization in the nervous system.",
            "Taking the foregoing considerations into account, a number of observational studies have made a strong claim that involvement of both CNS and PNS may occur in patients with ‘long-COVID’ syndrome.34,35,39 For example, in a large longitudinal analysis of 1733 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 76% of patients reported at 6 months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection at least one of the following symptoms: fatigue or muscle weakness (63%), sleep disturbances (26%), smell or taste impairment (11% and 7%, respectively), myalgias (2%), and headache (2%). Notably in this study, 23% and 27% of patients reported concomitant symptoms of anxiety/depression or pain/discomfort, respectively.\n35\n Similar results were obtained by a longitudinal analysis of 2433 patients with antecedent SARS-CoV-2 infection; at 1-year follow-up, the reported neurological symptoms included fatigue (30%), myalgia (8%), dizziness (3%), headache (2%), and taste/smell disorders (1%).\n5\n In an online international survey of 3762 participants with antecedent COVID-19, however, a much higher prevalence of neurological manifestations affecting the CNS and PNS was reported.\n32\n In the first 6 months after acute disease, the most frequently reported symptoms encompassed sensorimotor deficits (91%), cognitive dysfunction (85%), emotional/mood disorders (88%), sleep disturbances (79%), headache (77%), memory impairment (73%), and smell/taste disorders (58%). Crucially, 65% of the patients reported persistence of neurological symptoms beyond 6 months, with the most frequent being fatigue (80%), postexertional malaise (73%) and cognitive dysfunction (58%).",
            "In line with the previous findings, an observational study including 165 COVID-19 survivors reported that at 6-month follow-up after hospitalization, the most commonly reported symptoms were fatigue, memory/attention deficits, sleep disorders, and myalgias, with each symptom affecting one-third of patients with antecedent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further reported symptoms included depression/anxiety (27%), dyspnea (21%), visual disturbances (20%), numbness/tingling (19%), hyposmia/hypogeusia (16%), urinary dysfunction (14%), confusion/dizziness (13%), headache (10%), postural instability (9%), and swallowing difficulties (6%). A key finding of this study was that 40% of patients presented objectifiable abnormalities on neurological examination, with the most common being hyposmia (18%), cognitive deficits (18%), postural tremor (14%), and motor/sensory deficits (8%).\n40\n These results thus indicate that objectifiable correlates of CNS or PNS involvement are observed in more than one-third of ‘long-COVID’ patients.",
            "While evidence from observational studies continues to accrue, a recently published systematic review and meta-analysis, including data from 47,910 patients, provided prevalence estimates for long-term COVID-19 effects.\n41\n This meta-analysis revealed that 80% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed one or more long-lasting symptoms, with the most frequent being fatigue (58%), headache (44%), and attention disorder (27%). In addition, the following prevalence estimates for neurological manifestations were reported: ageusia (23%), anosmia (21%), memory loss (16%), hearing loss or tinnitus (15%), chills (7%), dizziness (3%), and stroke (3%). Crucially, psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety and depression, were observed in 13% and 12% of patients, respectively, while a lower prevalence was recorded for mood disorders, dysphoria, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), each affecting 2% of patients.\n41",
            "Perhaps the most robust estimates of incidence rates of neurological and psychiatric diagnoses in the 6 months following COVID-19 have been so far provided by an electronic health records analysis including 236,379 patients.\n27\n This study disclosed an incidence of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses of 34% in the 6 months following SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 13% of patients receiving their first such diagnosis within this period. Particularly with respect to neurological sequelae of COVID-19, in terms of predefined major neurological outcomes occurring within 6 months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, the authors found that the highest incidence was observed for nerve/nerve root/plexus disorders (2.9%) and insomnia (2.7%), followed by ischemic stroke (0.8%), dementia (0.7%), neuromuscular junction or muscle disease (0.5%), intracranial hemorrhage (0.3%), parkinsonism (0.1%), encephalitis (0.1%), and Guillain–Barré syndrome (0.1%). Moreover, when the researchers compared the probability of major neurological outcomes in patients previously diagnosed with COVID-19 with matched controls diagnosed with influenza or with other respiratory tract infections during the same study period, they showed a significantly higher risk for all the previous neurological outcomes – except for parkinsonism and Guillain–Barré syndrome – in patients who have had COVID-19 compared to those with influenza, and significantly greater risk for all outcomes in patients who have had COVID-19 compared to patients with respiratory tract infections.\n27\n Nevertheless, as only a small subset of neurological diagnoses was included in this electronic health records analysis and significant discrepancies between the incidence estimates of this study and previous results from observational research are noted, further epidemiological data are urgently needed to enable better characterization of neurological manifestations in the context of ‘long-COVID’ syndrome.",
            "The pathophysiological processes implicated in CNS and PNS manifestations of acute COVID-19 have been extensively studied and reviewed in the scientific literature.22,23,42,43 Besides severe affection of the respiratory system, cardiovascular, renal, and gastrointestinal manifestations, including liver and pancreatic dysfunction, are well-characterized complications of acute COVID-19.\n44\n In brief, several overlapping pathogenetic mechanisms of neurological manifestations of acute COVID-19 have been established, including viral neuroinvasion accompanied by aberrant neuroimmunological responses, endotheliopathy associated with blood–brain barrier dysfunction, coagulopathies that precipitate hypoxic–ischemic neuronal injury, metabolic imbalances, oxidative stress cascades, and cellular apoptosis (Figure 1).2,45–49 In contrast to acute neurological manifestations of COVID-19, however, the biological underpinnings of neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae remain today poorly characterized. In the absence of diagnostic markers and robust neuropathological data, most published articles have so far proposed putative pathophysiological mechanisms for neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae while drawing parallels with the pathophysiology of acute COVID-19.",
            "Potential pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in the manifestation of acute and ‘long-COVID’ manifestations in the central nervous system (CNS). (a) In acute COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 cell entry within the CNS is facilitated by hematogenous or direct transsynaptic pathways via engagement of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is located on the surface of diverse cell types, including neurons, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of cerebral blood vessels. SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm may cause disruption of the tight junctions at the endothelial lining of the blood–brain barrier, which leads to increased blood–brain barrier permeability and allows the transmigration of virus-infected leukocytes into the CNS. In addition, the cytokine release precipitates platelet activation and adhesion, which causes further endothelial impairment and has been linked to the increased thrombotic risk noted in acute COVID-19. Once cytokines and leukocytes have crossed the blood–brain barrier, they activate microglial cells, which in turn trigger apoptotic cascades and demyelination. (b) In ‘long-COVID’, chronic inflammatory and secondary degenerative processes are thought to prevail in propagating neurological ‘long-term’ sequelae. In ‘ACE2-rich’ brain areas, including areas of the somatosensory cortex, rectal/orbital gyrus, temporal lobe, hypothalamus/thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum, \n18\nF-FDG brain PET studies in ‘long-COVID’ patients have revealed prominent hypometabolism. The reduced glucose metabolism observed in these areas may be further explained by oxidative stress processes, mitochondrial dysfunction, or impaired cerebral autoregulation, which are secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "Direct neurotropic effects of SARS-CoV-2 are currently assumed to play a subordinate role in the pathogenesis of ‘long-COVID’, analogous to the circumscribed role of direct neuroinvasion in acute COVID-19.50,51 Notably, SARS-CoV-2 cell entry within the CNS and PNS is facilitated by hematogenous or transsynaptic pathways via engagement of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor,\n47\n which is located on the surface of diverse cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, endothelial and smooth muscle cells of cerebral blood vessels, as well as skeletal muscle cells.\n46\n Even in patients with severe neurological involvement in the setting of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is infrequently detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses, or in brain and skeletal muscle biopsies of symptomatic patients.48,52–54 As CSF or neuropathological evidence from ‘long-COVID’ patients is currently missing, the question of whether cellular SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs could perpetuate a chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection within the CNS or PNS remains unanswered.\n55\n In analogy to neuropathological correlates of acute COVID-19,48,53 however, virus-induced neuroinflammatory, prothrombotic, hypoxic, metabolic, and apoptotic cascades are thought to prevail in propagating neurological symptoms in the context of ‘long-COVID’.7,50,56",
            "In accordance with the spatial distribution of ACE2 receptors in the CNS, which are predominantly expressed in the olfactory bulb, amygdala, hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and the brainstem,57,58 a multitude of neurological symptoms encountered in ‘long-COVID’ patients, including hyposmia, mood disorders, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, and dysautonomia, have been linked to dysfunction of ‘ACE2-rich’ brain areas.\n46\n Intriguingly, a similar pattern of hypometabolism has been recently revealed in neuroimaging studies using 18F-FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) brain positron emission tomography (PET) in ‘long-COVID’ patients that exhibited hypometabolic areas extending from the rectal/orbital gyrus, including the olfactory gyrus, to the temporal lobe, including the amygdala and the hippocampus, to the hypothalamus and thalamus, and further to the brainstem and the cerebellum.59,60 With respect to the latter, the imaging evidence of brainstem and cerebellum involvement is crucial as it indicates that involvement of these brain regions may underlie several neurological manifestations of ‘long-COVID’ that bear similarities with the myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), and the postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).9,61,62 Accordingly, it has been suggested that the reduced glucose metabolism observed in these areas may be attributed to pathophysiological processes, such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuronal degeneration, and impaired cerebral autoregulation, that are secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection.63–65",
            "The hypothesis of a predominant autonomic dysfunction in ‘long-COVID’ has been recently bolstered by findings of impaired regulation of heart rate variability (HRV) in ‘long-COVID’ patients.\n66\n In a case-control study that included 27 patients with antecedent SARS-CoV-2 infection and 12 healthy controls, HRV dysregulation was significantly associated with foregoing COVID-19, as well as with the presence of fatigue in ‘long-COVID’ patients. In conjunction with the aforementioned evidence of brainstem involvement from neuroimaging studies, these data suggest that afferent and efferent pathways of the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, which are also implicated in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection,67,68 could be involved in demyelinating or Wallerian degeneration processes secondary to viral invasion.\n45\n Although further research is needed to evaluate these hypotheses, neuronal atrophy and degeneration of other cranial nerves, including the olfactory nerve and the adjacent olfactory bulb, have been previously described in patients with persisting hyposmia or anosmia following the resolution of acute COVID-19.42,69 Important insights into the role of neuroinflammation in ‘long-COVID’ have recently been provided by a series of studies, which have signified that abnormal humoral and cellular immune responses,70,71 systemic inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6),41,65 and autoantibodies targeting cellular receptors\n72\n may be implicated in systemic and neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae. Particularly with respect to neuroinflammatory processes, a study that appeared recently on a preprint server, including 56 patients with persisting neurological deficits for more than 6 weeks after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, showed a reduced effector molecule expression in memory T cells, which was significantly associated with the severity of cognitive impairment.\n73\n In addition, prolonged endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation have also been linked to ‘long-COVID’ syndrome,74,75 albeit 18F-FDG PET studies have not revealed areas of brain hypermetabolism, as would be expected in the case of unabating brain inflammation.59,60 Crucially, ongoing blood–brain barrier dysfunction, as well as a prolonged hypercoagulable state that could precipitate cerebrovascular disease and hypoxic–ischemic neuronal injury, may also be implicated in neurological manifestations of ‘long-COVID’. Notably, a recent case-control prospective study reported an independent association between SARS-CoV-2 infection, oxidative stress, and endothelial/vascular dysfunction, which was associated with impaired cardiac performance and persistence of COVID-related symptoms 4 months after COVID-19 infection.\n75\n To date, however, there are no available data in ‘long-COVID’ patients with neurological symptoms in support of these hypotheses.",
            "Concomitant involvement of other organ systems should also be considered when addressing the pathophysiology of neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae. While pathophysiological associations between nonspecific neurological symptoms, such as fatigue, ‘brain fog’, and postexertional malaise, and concomitant COVID-19-induced pulmonary or cardiac changes are well characterized,76,77 an involvement of the gastrointestinal tract and the brain–gut axis have also been recently proposed as a possible link to neurological manifestations of ‘long-COVID’.78,79 In particular, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding has been observed in the gastrointestinal tract for up to 3 months postacute infection, with a recent study showing persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids and proteins in 50% of patients who underwent intestinal biopsy.\n80\n Bearing the role of brain–gut axis in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders in mind,\n81\n further research is warranted to evaluate whether insidious gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection may be causally linked to neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae.",
            "Finally, as a concluding remark on the pathophysiology of neurological manifestations of ‘long-COVID’, despite some ominous predictions expressed in the literature for perpetuation of neurodegeneration following SARS-CoV-2 infection, a recently published longitudinal study has indicated attenuation of CNS injury, despite the persistence of neurological symptoms at 6 months after acute COVID-19.\n82\n In this study, the researchers measured biomarkers of astrocytic and neuronal injury, including neurofilament light-chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp), and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), in 100 patients with antecedent SARS-CoV-2 infection and showed that despite significant elevation of these biomarkers’ concentrations during the acute phase of COVID-19, at 6-month follow-up, a normalization of all biomarkers was noted in all included patients. Nonetheless, one half of patients reported persistent neurological symptoms at 6 months, with the most frequent being fatigue in 40%, followed by ‘brain fog’ and cognitive changes in 29% and 25%, respectively. These data suggest that ongoing CNS injury may not necessarily accompany neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae\n82\n and further indicate the pivotal role of a systematic approach for characterization, differential diagnosis, and management of ‘long-COVID’ symptoms. As acute COVID-19 has been associated with impaired neurotransmission and upper layer cortical circuitry dysfunction,\n83\n a prolonged recovery of neurotransmission could underlie the prolonged neurological and cognitive deficits noted in ‘long-COVID’ patients.",
            "Taken together, the previous data reveal a very wide spectrum of neurological symptoms among COVID-19 survivors with only partially elucidated underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. There is thus a lot of ground still to be covered before diagnostic criteria for neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae can be solidified. In the absence of widely accepted operational definitions for ‘long-COVID’, the presence of symptoms, signs, or abnormal findings that persist beyond the resolution of acute COVID-19 and do not return to a premorbid baseline may be currently considered as long-term effects of the disease.41,84 As a consequence, a pragmatic approach to neurological sequelae of ‘long-COVID’ entails assessment of change from neurological baseline (Figure 2). Notably, premorbid neurological disorders have been shown to confer an increased susceptibility to ‘long-COVID’.85,86 Thus, exclusion of potential exacerbations of preexisting neurological or psychiatric disease due to SARS-CoV-2 is required before ascribing neurological symptoms to ‘long-COVID’. Moreover, as previously noted, ‘long-COVID’ comprises a multisystem disease. It is thus imperative to evaluate potential involvement of other organ systems that could precipitate secondary neurological symptoms.\n87\n In addition, it should be kept in mind that vigilance is warranted in the differential diagnosis of neurological symptoms that manifest in temporal association with COVID-19. In particular, exclusion of ‘long-COVID’ mimics is required,88,89 including neurological and non-neurological disorders that may occur after COVID-19, but be causally unrelated to antecedent SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n90",
            "Proposed diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for patients presenting with neurological symptoms compatible with ‘long-COVID’.",
            "ME/CFS, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome; POTS, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.",
            "Besides the challenges in distinction of ‘true long-COVID’ from exacerbations or manifestations of new unrelated underlying disorders, some further aspects should be taken into account when approaching ‘long-COVID’ syndrome. First, there is currently lack of consensus on whether confirmed COVID-19 in the patient history or serological evidence of antecedent SARS-CoV-2 infection should be regarded as a prerequisite for ‘long-COVID’ diagnosis, as a substantial proportion of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 remain asymptomatic or undiagnosed91,92 and highly variable seroprevalence rates have been reported during the post-COVID period,93–95 which are further confounded by serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.96,97 Second, there is no consensus on an exact timeframe for defining ‘long-COVID’ in the literature. Some authors have proposed that ‘long-COVID’ may be considered after 2 weeks following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection,41,86 while a cut-off of 4 weeks after acute infection has been proposed by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).\n17\n Conversely, the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines distinguish between ‘ongoing symptomatic COVID-19’, which can be diagnosed in the period between 4 and 12 weeks postinfection, and ‘post-COVID-19 syndrome’, which may be diagnosed if symptoms persist beyond 12 weeks, with the latter definition also supported by the WHO (Table 1).19,18 While the issue of when to draw a line between acute and long-COVID remains unresolved, the more recent inclusive approach of WHO6,20 may be currently more appropriate, until more evidence has been acquired to enable refinement of operational case definitions. In addition, the maximum time interval that allows ‘long-COVID’ diagnosis remains to be established, with recent evidence pointing toward a duration of ‘long-COVID’ symptoms of more than 7 or 12 months after viral infection,5,32,98 albeit the duration of ‘long-COVID’ may be currently underestimated due to the short follow-up periods of most so-far published observational studies.\n41",
            "Another salient issue that merits mention when approaching neurological manifestations of ‘long-COVID’ is the question of whether neurological sequelae of intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 survivors may fall under the scope of ‘long-COVID’. Most published studies have focused so far on all hospitalized and/or nonhospitalized patients, analyzing jointly those with severe and mild disease.41,99,100 Nonetheless, criticism has been raised that attributing ‘long-COVID’ diagnosis to formerly critically ill COVID-19 patients may further confound the characterization of the syndrome and even jeopardize patient care.100,101 Notably, acute neurological COVID-19 manifestations, including encephalopathy/encephalitis, delirium, cerebrovascular events, epileptic seizures, hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, and neuromuscular disorders,102–104 differ significantly in incidence and severity between critically ill, hospitalized nonventilated, and nonhospitalized patients.104,105 Moreover, severe non-neurological complications and long-term organ dysfunction, including respiratory and cardiac failure, have been significantly associated with the severity of previous COVID-19.100,106 Consequently, it remains unclear whether, from a pathophysiological perspective, long-term symptomatic ICU survivors and mildly affected COVID-19 patients could share the same common denominator of ‘long-COVID’ syndrome. In fact, a growing body of evidence indicates that long-lasting neurological deficits of ICU COVID-19 survivors display many similarities to postintensive care syndrome (PICS).27,40,101,107 Thus, further research is required to identify potential overlaps and enable distinction between neurological manifestations of ‘long-COVID’ and PICS.",
            "With respect to potential risk factors for neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae, there are no reliable data to date to facilitate identification of high-risk patients in clinical practice.\n108\n Although, as stated previously, preexisting neurological morbidity and the severity of antecedent COVID-19 may portend poor long-term neurological outcome, some studies have reported opposite results that suggest a particularly high prevalence of long-term neurological symptoms among previously healthy individuals, who had not been hospitalized for COVID-19.106,109 Discordant findings are also found in the literature concerning the contribution of demographic factors to ‘long-COVID’. With respect to age, for example, although a number of studies support that increasing age confers an increased susceptibility to long-term sequelae,5,40,109 other studies reported that younger patients may be at higher risk of ‘long-COVID’.\n110\n Moreover, a striking prevalence of ‘long-COVID’ symptoms of nearly 43% has been reported in children with antecedent SARS-CoV-2 infection, albeit these prevalence estimates remain debatable.111,112 Similarly, highly disparate findings have been published regarding the potential sex predisposition to ‘long-COVID’, with some studies suggesting an association between female sex and neurological ‘long-COVID’ symptoms, some detecting no associations with sex, and some reporting a higher vulnerability of male patients (in analogy to acute COVID-19) to ‘long-COVID’ sequelae.109,110,113,114 Further potential risk factors, including coexisting cerebrovascular disease,\n5\n constitutional factors and psychosocial stressors, have been described in other studies. A meaningful interpretation of these data is, however, currently not possible due the high heterogeneity of the so-far available observational studies and due to considerable methodological constraints, including mixed patient populations, variable follow-up periods, and unstandardized documentation of risk factors, comorbidities, and clinical symptoms.29,108,109,115",
            "Notwithstanding the aforementioned limitations in defining and approaching ‘long-COVID’, our understanding of long-term neurological sequelae of COVID-19 has begun to steadily expand. Emerging studies have provided promising evidence of improvement or even resolution of neurological symptoms, including hyposmia,\n116\n anxiety/depression, cognitive impairment, fatigue, and overall functional status,117,118 at longer follow-up periods, up to 1 year following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. It should be noted that in the upcoming months, the results from international registries and NeuroCOVID-19 task forces are anticipated, which will expectedly shed more light onto characteristics, risk factors and long-term outcomes of ‘long-COVID’ patients.\n119\n In the meantime, standardized approaches for evaluating and reporting neurological manifestations of ‘long-COVID’ syndrome are warranted to allow for development of operational case definitions, which will eventually enable better characterization and prevention of long-term neurological COVID-19 sequelae.",
            "While focusing on neurological manifestations of ‘long-COVID’ syndrome, it should be highlighted that as ‘long-COVID’ comprises a multisystem disease, comprehensive patient evaluation and interdisciplinary collaboration are fundamental for optimal patient care. As post-COVID-19 clinics continue to expand worldwide,120,121 it has become apparent that the clinical management of ‘long-COVID’ demands both specialized expertise and a whole-patient perspective.\n87\n Several national and international medical societies have issued diagnostic algorithms and treatment guidelines to facilitate ‘long-COVID’ patient care.19,87,122 Particularly with respect to neurological manifestations of ‘long-COVID’, however, there is a striking gap in the scientific literature as to what concerns treatment recommendations for neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae. Here, we propose a practical algorithm for diagnosis and management of patients presenting with neurological symptoms in the context of ‘long-COVID’ syndrome (Figure 2).",
            "As previously discussed, nonspecific neurological symptoms may be causally linked to other persisting organ system dysfunction due to COVID-19, including respiratory, cardiovascular, psychiatric, endocrine, renal, hematologic, or autoimmune disease.8,25,29 Thus, early patient referral to other medical specialties and initiation of appropriate targeted treatments should be promptly considered.\n21\n It is important to note that the use of standardized clinical, neurological, and functional scales is pivotal for initial patient assessment and follow-up.123–126 Crucially, clinical evaluation should entail a thorough assessment of respiratory and cardiac function, as ‘silent hypoxia’, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure are frequently encountered in ‘long COVID’ patients.127,128 Moreover, particularly in patients presenting with fatigue, dyspnea, and postexertional malaise or autonomic dysfunction, assessment of oxygen saturation at rest and post exertion, performance of the 6-Minute Walk Test, and measurement of blood pressure (in lying position and while standing) are recommended.87,122,129 With respect to neurological and neuropsychological scales, assessment of the fatigue severity scale,21,130 depression scale,\n131\n anxiety, PTSD and apathy scales,132,133 smell identification tests,\n134\n neurological impairment scales,\n123\n cognitive assessment, and specific scales depending on the neurological symptoms and signs of ‘long-COVID’ patients may be considered. In addition, a functional status scale has been recently introduced to aid monitoring of functional status in ‘long-COVID’, but its utility in clinical practice awaits validation.\n135",
            "After initial clinical assessment, tailored ancillary testing, including blood tests, respiratory and cardiac function tests, neuroimaging, CSF and electrophysiological studies, may complement the neurological examination and should be decided on an individual patient basis.\n136\n With respect to blood testing, assessment of full blood count, electrolytes, liver and renal function parameters, troponin, C-reactive protein, creatine kinase, D-dimer, brain natriuretic peptides, ferritin, and thyroid hormonal status has been recommended for initial patient screening.19,87 In addition, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), and urine tests may be indicated depending on the findings of the clinical examination.87,122 Taken together, these recommendations underline that early identification and treatment of comorbidities comprise a cornerstone for the management of patients with neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae. Moreover, tailored neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies may be indicated for the exclusion of serious neurological CNS or PNS disorders, albeit previously published guidelines on ‘long-COVID’ emphasize that overinvestigation should be avoided.87,137",
            "After excluding serious comorbidities or ongoing complications of COVID-19, management of neurological manifestations of ‘long-COVID’ should be pragmatic and symptom-oriented.21,87,137 To date, there is very limited evidence that pharmacological approaches could be effective in the treatment of neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae.29,87 Recently, results from a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that included 200 patients with post-COVID fatigue were published.\n138\n In this randomized-controlled clinical trial (RCT), supplementation with systemic enzyme complex (ImmunoSEBTM) and probiotic complex (ProbioSEB CSC3TM) resulted in a significantly greater attenuation of physical and mental fatigue scores in treated patients compared with patients allocated to the placebo group. Despite this promising preliminary evidence, however, due to several methodological limitations, these findings warrant replication in future, larger, well-designed RCTs. In addition, some expert recommendations have been recently published arguing that supplementation of vitamins, including vitamin B2, E, and C, and administration of antioxidants, including coenzyme Q10, alpha lipoic acid, L-carnitine, or L-creatine,21,139 may hold some therapeutic potential. Nevertheless, their utility in patients with neurological manifestations of ‘long-COVID’ remains to be verified in the context of prospective RCTs. In addition, as neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae have prompted comparisons with ME/CFS, it should be noted that previous RCTs on ME/CFS have failed to detect any consistent benefit from pharmacological treatments (including antidepressants), while highly discordant results have been obtained from nonpharmacological therapies (including cognitive-behavior therapy, graded-exercise-related therapies, rehabilitation, and acupuncture).140,141 Crucially, although the role of antidepressants has been appraised after results from recent RCTs were published, indicating positive effects from the use of fluvoxamine on the course of acute COVID-19,142,143 only small anecdotal, nonrandomized studies have so far provided some preliminary positive evidence from antidepressant use in post-COVID depression.\n144\n Thus, the question of whether repurposing of antidepressants would be meaningful for patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms post-COVID, including mood disorders and fatigue, remains to be established in prospective, well-designed RCTs.",
            "Hence, pending evidence from ongoing RCTs on neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae,119,145 the therapeutic approach of patients with prolonged neurological symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection remains today supportive. Specifically with respect to neurorehabilitation, the Stanford Hall consensus statement recommends early initiation of rehabilitation for patients with moderate-to-severe neurological symptoms to maximize functional recovery.\n126\n Crucially, neurorehabilitation strategies require involvement of multidisciplinary care teams, including neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists.\n136\n In addition, involvement of geriatric specialists is of particular strategic importance to mitigate the global burden of ‘long-COVID’, especially in the frail elderly population.146,147 Finally, the implementation of psychological interventions for people experiencing debilitating ‘long-COVID’ symptoms is of paramount importance for the restoration of health and well-being amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n148",
            "In this narrative review, we presented a comprehensive overview of the so-far documented neurological manifestations of ‘long-COVID’ syndrome, along with the currently proposed pathophysiological mechanisms for propagation of neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae. In accord with the presented literature, manifestations of ‘long-COVID’ may affect any part of the human nervous system, while the most frequent neurological symptoms among ‘long-COVID’ patients encompass fatigue; ‘brain fog’; headache; cognitive impairment; sleep, mood, smell, or taste disorders; myalgias; sensorimotor deficits; and dysautonomia. Currently, there are insufficient data to allow unequivocal inferences regarding the neuropathological constituents of ‘long-COVID’, albeit neuroimmunological and ongoing oxidative stress processes are thought to prevail in the propagation of neurological symptoms in ‘long-COVID’ patients.7,50,56 Moreover, in analogy to acute COVID-19, while autopsy studies have revealed vascular-related and infection-related secondary inflammatory damage in brain tissue, histopathological studies are urgently needed to assess whether such long-lasting effects could represent the histopathological substrate of ‘long-COVID’ neurological sequelae.\n149",
            "Conversely, based on the so-far published epidemiological data several inferences can be drawn. First, neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae, with clinically objectifiable correlates of CNS or PNS involvement, seem to affect at least one-third of patients with antecedent SARS-CoV-2 infection.27,40 Nonetheless, a threefold higher incidence is documented in observational studies including self-reported data from COVID-19 survivors.32,34–38,150 Second, there is a substantial overlap between neurological and psychiatric ‘long-COVID’ symptoms. In a significant proportion of ‘long-COVID’ patients, however, concomitant respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, renal, hematologic, or autoimmune disease may underlie the manifestation of nonspecific neurological ‘long-COVID’ symptoms.8,25,29 Third, there is preliminary evidence indicating an increased risk of neurological long-term sequelae among patients with antecedent SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with patients infected with other respiratory tract viruses, including influenza but also other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).27,151,152 Thus, further research is required to delineate the pathophysiological underpinnings of long-term SARS-CoV-2 effects in the nervous system, which may ultimately facilitate development of targeted therapies for neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae.",
            "Several key aspects regarding the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae can also be summarized based on the present review. First, there is an urgent need for establishment of operational ‘long-COVID’ case definitions that should be integrated in the design of prospective RCTs. Second, stringent documentation of clinical symptoms/signs, risk factors, foregoing COVID-19 complications, and comorbidities is required for a systematic approach and management of ‘long-COVID’ patients. Third, multidisciplinary collaboration is essential to provide comprehensive and integrative ‘long-COVID’ patient care.\n87\n Fourth, early neurorehabilitation should be recommended for patients experiencing long-lasting neurological symptoms after the resolution of acute COVID-19.\n126\n Fifth, it should be emphasized that due to the nonsystematic nature of the present review, despite expert consensus on the included literature, selection bias cannot be excluded and a systematic review of the literature is warranted to broaden our understanding on neurological ‘long COVID’ sequelae. Finally, although there is a current paucity of evidence on nonpharmacological and pharmacological therapies for ‘long-COVID’, preliminary data suggest that supplementation with antioxidants may hold some therapeutic potential in ‘long-COVID’ fatigue.21,139 Future RCTs are thus warranted to evaluate the potential utility of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions in ‘long-COVID’ patients.",
            "In conclusion, neurologists are confronted today with an unprecedented need to comprehend and manage neurological ‘long-COVID’ sequelae. These challenging times call for international collaborations between medical societies, swift and transparent communication of research data, and further mandate basic research to gain insight into the pathophysiological correlates of ‘long-COVID’. In addition, considering the increasing societal demand for evidence-based interventions for ‘long-COVID’ patients, it is time for scientists to join forces for the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 survivors, with the aim to mitigate the community-wide toll of an impending ‘long-COVID’ pandemic.",

            "SARS-CoV2 infection is responsible for a complex clinical syndrome, named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), whose main consequences are severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Occurrence of acute and subacute neurological manifestations (encephalitis, stroke, headache, seizures, Guillain–Barrè syndrome) is increasingly reported in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SARS-CoV2 immunopathology and tissue colonization in the gut and the central nervous system, and the systemic inflammatory response during COVID-19 may potentially trigger chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. Specifically, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and narcolepsy present several pathogenic mechanisms that can be hypothetically initiated by SARS-CoV2 infection in susceptible individuals. In this short narrative review, we summarize the clinical evidence supporting the rationale for investigating SARS-CoV2 infection as risk factor for these neurological disorders, and suggest the opportunity to perform in the future SARS-CoV2 serology when diagnosing these disorders.",
            "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), emerged from China and spread worldwide as pandemic. SARS-CoV2 infection is responsible for a heterogeneous clinical syndrome, leading to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), titled coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The occurrence of neurological manifestations, including encephalitis, stroke, headache, seizures, Guillain–Barrè syndrome, is increasingly reported in patients with COVID-19 [1–4]. Although these neurological manifestations of COVID-19 suggest a possibly acute or subacute neuropathogenicity of the virus, the risk of long-term neurological sequelae in patients affected by SARS-CoV2 is not understood and currently debated [5, 6].",
            "Available data on COVID-19 currently disclosed that SARS-CoV2 can induce, directly or indirectly, a number of clinical manifestations and immune–inflammatory events, including viral–host interactions, that might shape pathogenic mechanisms underlying common chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders [2, 5, 6].",
            "In this review, we will specifically discuss the biological events possibly initiated by SARS-CoV2 infection potentially overlapping with etiological mechanisms featuring Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), or narcolepsy. Building on these evidences, we will highlight the need to monitor patients affected by COVID-19 who can develop PD, MS, or narcolepsy as long-term neurological consequences of the infection.",
            "PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by progressive motor and non-motor disturbances, due to the loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn)-positive Lewy bodies [7–9]. The relationship between viral infections and PD has its roots in the early twentieth century, when a number of post-encephalitic parkinsonism were observed following an influenza outbreak. Aside from this historical event, infectious diseases, including viral infections, have been demonstrated increasing the risk for PD by 20% [10]. The mechanisms underlying this association may imply a direct neuronal injury due to the central nervous system (CNS) invasion by viruses and subsequent loss of dopaminergic cells into the SNpc. Indeed, it has been recently demonstrated in Rag knockout mice that H1N1 Influenza-A virus infection inhibits protein degradation at autophagosome–lysosome system level and precipitates α-syn accumulation [11]. Further experimental evidence showed that Influenza-A virus disrupts mitochondrial activity and increase oxidative stress [12, 13], whereas hepatitis C virus impairs dopaminergic transmission and affects the blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity [10]. Therefore, viral infections may intervene in cellular pathways critical for PD pathogenesis, probably contributing to the initiation of the disease [8, 9, 14–17].",
            "Although the CNS colonization by SARS-CoV2 has been proven, the consequences on neurons at a molecular level have been only hypothesized [5, 6]. However, it is interesting to note that the virus may affect brain areas particularly involved in early phases of PD neurodegeneration. Many patients with COVID-19 indeed complained of anosmia and ageusia [18], which are two classical prodromal features of PD [19]. Actually, SARS-CoV2 might invade the brain through the olfactory tracts and spread towards the piriform and infralimbic cortex, the basal ganglia and the brainstem [18]. Neuropathological evidence suggests that, in PD, Lewy body accumulation is primarily localized in the olfactory pathway, and then propagates to other brain structures following olfactory system connections causing neuronal degeneration [19, 20]. This potential overlap between the SARS-CoV2 propagation and the spreading of PD neuropathology is particularly alarming if we consider that some patients with COVID-19 do not recover (or partially recover) smell sense [18], thus, indicating a possible neuronal injury that in turn might trigger the synucleinopathy cascade [21]. Aside from the direct invasion of CNS, SARS-CoV2 might increase the risk for PD because of the induction of a systemic inflammatory state [22]. Cytokine production is fundamental in the immunological response to viruses. However, an excessive and dysregulated release of interferons (IFNs), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and chemokines (C–C motif chemokine ligand, CCL-2, CCL-3, and CCL-5), shaping the so-called cytokine storm, can be deleterious, causing an immune-mediated attack to human organs [23]. COVID-19 patients present a systemic inflammatory state, as demonstrated by the significant increase of C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-2R, and ferritin blood levels [24]. Similar profile of peripheral inflammation is notably observed in PD patients, who exhibit higher blood levels of CRP and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IL-1β and IL-2) [25, 26], directly correlated with clinical severity [27]. The inflammatory activation due to COVID-19 may thus disrupt the systemic homeostasis at the CNS level, where it could trigger and feed initial steps of synucleinopathy, favouring PD onset, as compelling experimental evidence suggests [22, 28].",
            "COVID-19 is also responsible for gastrointestinal symptoms [29], and SARS-CoV2 RNA has been tracked in the faeces of infected patients indicating an intestinal localization of the virus. A recent study demonstrated that enterocytes represent major target cells of SARS-CoV2 reacting to the infection with a strong inflammatory response [30]. These findings might further highlight the role of COVID-19 as a potential risk factor for PD. In fact, an experimental intestinal infection was able to turn PINK1 asymptomatic mouse model into a fully penetrant model, with levodopa-responsive motor symptoms, probably trough an immune-mediated multisystem mechanism [31]. Moreover, SARS-CoV2 intestinal infection may alter gut microbiota and gut physiology overall [32], influencing all factors providing the “peripheral” contribute to PD pathogenesis and progression [33].",
            "Finally, it should be also considered psychiatric comorbidity of COVID-19. Actually, patients can develop depression, anxiety and fatigue, which may have both psychological and organic causes [34]. Regardless of the cause, mood disorders are associated with neuroinflammation and often exert detrimental effects on CNS, contributing to neurodegeneration [35]. Hence, COVID-19 definitely represents a stressful event that may have a role in triggering PD [36].",
            "MS is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the CNS whose pathological hallmark is focal demyelination associated with various degrees of neurodegeneration [37]. Complex immunological dysfunction—involving peripheral T and B lymphocytes and resident CNS immune cells—represents the immunological substrate for MS development and progression [38]. The intermittent aberrant activation of self-reacting immune cell subsets results in their transmigration across the BBB into the CNS, where they induce demyelinating and, ultimately, neuronal damage manifesting as clinical relapse and disability accumulation. The aetiology of the disease, as well as its periodic relapses, is not established yet, but environmental triggers acting on susceptible individuals are implicated. For over a century, since Pierre Marie initial intuition in 1884, MS was believed to be caused by infectious agents and many viruses, including coronavirus, have been proposed as potential candidates [39]. Viral infection contributes to demyelination through several mechanisms such as molecular mimicry, bystander inflammatory damage or direct oligodendrocyte infection [39]. MS onset may occur long after acute infection as consistently demonstrated for by Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) [40]. Infectious mononucleosis by EBV supervening during the early adulthood, in fact, is an established risk factor for further MS development [41–45]; moreover, compelling evidence shows that almost all subjects with MS have positive serology for EBV. The “prime/challenging” theory has been proposed to explain the delay between early infection and MS onset; according to this assumption, the initial infection, such as by EBV, would prime autoreactive cells in susceptible individuals via molecular mimicry and bystander activation, setting up a fertile-field. Further infection by other microorganism, or even reactivation of EBV under favouring circumstances, will activate the preexisting autoreactive cells leading to inflammatory demyelination [40, 46]. Studies in MS patients infected by SARS-CoV2 are ongoing aiming at identifying the effects of iatrogenic immune modulation/suppression on the severity of infection [47, 48]. Nevertheless, the effect of the virus on MS-related inflammatory activity has not been investigated yet, but few cases of acute inflammatory demyelinating disorder have been already described. It would not be surprising that SARS-CoV2 might act as “priming” or “challenging” infectious agent in “primed” individuals. Moreover, in individuals with MS, autoreactive T cells able to recognize both viral and myelin antigens have been found [49]. Additionally, SARS-CoV2 infection is associated with peripheral lymphopenia in more than 80% of patients with COVID-19. Lymphopenia is sustained by a predominant decrease of CD3 + , CD8 + , and CD4 + T cell counts, while B cells and NK are only mildly affected [50]. Patients infected by SARS-CoV during the 2002–04 outbreak recovered normal T lymphocytes count in about 2 months in the majority of case, and more rarely the recovery took more than 12 months [51]. Sequestration in the lung, intestine and other tissues, and senescence and exhaustion of the anti-viral CD8 response [50, 52], explain this selective immunodepletion. We can speculate that defective anti-viral CD8 immunological response may reduce immunosurveillance on other latent pathogens potentially able to trigger MS or other post-infectious demyelinating disorders, such as Guillain–Barrè syndrome or its variants [53]. Co-infection with EBV, in fact, has been observed in patients affected by COVID-19, mainly in those with lower CD4/CD8 ratio [54]. Nevertheless, unbalance of peripheral lymphocyte subsets induced by COVID-19, and in particular B cell overshooting, may hypothetically represent an additional risk for MS relapses in patients with pre-existing diagnosis, as observed in similar immunological framework [55]. The “cytokine storm” in response to the SARS-CoV2 infection may promote a switch toward a pro-inflammatory status of T cell subsets, such as Th17, which are implicated in MS pathogenesis [56]",
            "COVID-19 may indeed trigger MS or its clinical manifestation also through other mechanisms. In MS, intestinal dysbiosis and changes in intestinal permeability are increasingly recognized as modulators of neuroinflammatory mechanisms through the so-called gut–brain axis [57]. Therefore, the alteration of the intestinal barrier and microbiota induced by SARS-CoV2 may enhance autoreactive response (as previously mentioned).",
            "Finally, it is worth noting that SARS-CoV2 is able to directly infect the CNS via olfactory pathway or hematogenous route using the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor type 2 (ACE2) expressed in the CNS and in the vascular endothelium [6].",
            "Coronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus, may invade neurons and oligodendrocytes, establish a persistent infection of astrocytes and locally activate and immortalize microglial cells causing brain and spinal demyelination featuring MS, as observed in animal models and humans [58–61]. Moreover, strains of human coronavirus have been found in brain autoptic specimens of patients with MS [62]; additionally, MS patients show higher intrathecal antibody synthesis against coronaviruses than matched controls [45].",
            "Building on these evidences, MS may result from previous SARS-CoV2 infection due several mechanisms: (1) a “challenging” effect of the virus in susceptible subjects previously exposed to priming pathogens; (2) unbalance of peripheral lymphocyte subsets and massive cytokine release producing a pro-inflammatory environment and triggering autoimmune reactions; (3) induction of post-infectious demyelinating events associated with direct CNS invasion and microglial reaction.",
            "Narcolepsy is a rare sleep disorder featured by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and REM sleep-associated symptoms, such as cataplexy (loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions), hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The prevalence of narcolepsy in 2016 was of 44.3 per 100,000 persons [63]. The main increase in narcolepsy diagnosis was in particular evident following Influenza-A H1N1 pandemic in 2009, and was evident in both patients affected by Influenza-A H1N1 and in patients vaccinated against this virus with Pandemrix (an adjuvanted vaccine) [64]. International classification of Sleep Disorders—3rd Edition classifies narcolepsy into two types, namely narcolepsy types 1 and 2 (NT1/2) [65]. The main clinical difference between these two forms of narcolepsy is the occurrence of cataplexy, which is the result of orexin (OX) neuron degeneration [65]. The OX system degeneration results in the not detectable levels of OX in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), consisting of the main diagnostic feature of NT1 [66]. Conversely, in NT2, the partial degeneration of OX neurons corresponds to normal CSF OX levels [67].",
            "The main pathogenic causes of narcolepsy have been exclusively supposed with different levels of evidence since OX neuron degeneration remains a not-well-explained phenomenon. Several lines of evidence suggest that narcolepsy arises from the interaction of genetic, environmental and triggering factors, which leads to an immune-mediated selective loss or dysfunction of OX neurons in the brain lateral hypothalamus. Briefly, as summarized by Bassetti and coauthors [68], genetic factors (especially HLA-DQB1*06:02 positivity) are a strong predisposition to narcolepsy. Ensuing this genetic susceptibility, environmental exposures to bacterial and viral infections may alter or trigger the immune system reaction that in turn may attack the OX neurons. Several researches have been performed to understand the cascade of events leading to OX system and involving the different subsets of immune cells (B cells, T CD4 + and T CD8 + cells) [69, 70]. Not significant results have been achieved regarding the detection of specific autoantibodies produced by B cells [71]; conversely, T cells seem to have direct and indirect effects on OX neurons. In particular, in 2018, autoreactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells targeting antigens expressed by OX neurons have been documented in patients with NT1 or NT2 [72]. This research highlighted the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy; however, the lack of proliferation of T cell clones in response to H1N1 influenza vaccine does not permit to achieve a definite conclusion [72]. Therefore, although widely supposed the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy, the chain of events producing OX neuron degeneration has not been completely identified. Finally, the increased levels of specific cytokines (TNF and IL-6 among others) further support the evidence of an inflammatory and immune response in patients with narcolepsy since the very early phases of the disease [73]. The reduction of CSF ß-amyloid42 levels in patients with narcolepsy near to disease onset has been also associated with the brain inflammatory response [74–76]. Moreover, other proofs of the activation of the immune system have been documented in patients with NT1, also with long-lasting disease [77].",
            "The SARS-CoV2 viral outbreak may also present a unique opportunity to better understand the association between immune system activation and the development of autoimmune conditions such as narcolepsy [78]. Considering the non-haematological routes of infection, SARS-CoV2 can migrate from the olfactory bulb to hypothalamus and affect the OX neurons [78]. In keeping with this hypothetical model of CNS damage, the olfactory bulb may represent a link between environmental agents (such as SARS-CoV2) and narcolepsy, in patients with a genetic predisposition [79]. The olfactory bulb, in fact, provides an efficient port for neuroinvasion [80]. Neurotropic, but also non-neurotropic, viruses may use this gateway to enter the CNS using the BBB disruption caused by the activated inflammatory processes [80]. Moreover, the inflammatory response (in particular proinflammatory cytokines) can enhance BBB permeability promoting the transendothelial migration of T cells (activated against the virus), which can damage the OX hypothalamic neurons [81]. The documentation of olfactory dysfunction in patients with narcolepsy can reinforce this hypothesis and highlight the role of olfactory bulb in the pathogenic mechanisms of narcolepsy [82].",
            "Taking these hypotheses into account, the main message of this review to sleep medicine clinicians and researches is to consider SARS-CoV2 infection as a possibly triggering event leading to narcolepsy. The previous experience of Influenza-A H1N1 infection and vaccination should raise the opportunity to monitor subjects affected with COVID-19 also after resolution of the infection since the occurrence of EDS (in same cases already present during the infection) may represent a preliminary manifestation of OX dysfunction.",
            "Both retrospective analysis achieved by reviewing clinical charts of patients with COVID-19 and prospective observational studies [2, 83, 84] provided compelling evidence on the CNS involvement during SARS-CoV2 infection, which definitely supports the hypothesis of a neuropathogenic effect of the virus. Early experimental data on SARS-CoV2 and existing literature about other coronaviruses allow supposing several mechanisms of neuroinvasion of the virus, including the trans-synaptic spread from peripheral nerves, the BBB passage mediated by ACE2 receptors or abnormal permeability, and the “Trojan horse” strategy due to the brain entrance of immune cells infected through ACE2 receptors [2, 6].",
            "This brief narrative review summarized the mechanisms of CNS affection during SARS-CoV2 infection, which include different pathways and pathogenic cascades, concluding in chronic neuroinflammatory or neurodegenerative processes that typically underlie both common (PD and MS) or rare (narcolepsy) neurological diseases. In addition to direct neuronal injury, we also highlighted how SARS-CoV2 might have a role in the successive development of these chronic neurological disorders because of the activation of systemic inflammatory response, favouring a culprit unbalance in the immune system or affecting other critical players of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, such as BBB integrity and gut–brain axis (Fig. 1).Fig. 1SARS-CoV2-induced mechanisms for neuropathogenicity. The scheme represents direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 that overlap with defined pathogenic mechanisms of common and rare chronic neurological disorders, suggesting its potential role as risk factor",

            "Although long-term neuropathogenic effect of SARS-CoV2 has not yet been proven in experimental settings, available knowledge on both COVID-19 clinical events and established pathophysiological dynamics of chronic neurological disorders lead us to look at SARS-CoV2 infection as a potential trigger or risk factor for neurological disorders.",
            "In conclusion, prospective neurological follow-up of both COVID-19 survivors and asymptomatic infected individuals, and case–control observational studies are mandatory to establish the effective long-term neuropathogenicity of the virus and achieve early diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions. On the other hand, COVID-19 should be considered a critical anamnestic cue and serology for SARS-CoV2 infection can be planned when approaching patients with neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, or sleep disorders.",

            "The chronic dysfunction of neuronal cells, both central and peripheral, a characteristic of neurological disorders, may be caused by irreversible damage and cell death. In 2016, more than 276 million cases of neurological disorders were reported worldwide. Moreover, neurological disorders are the second leading cause of death. Generally, the etiology of neurological diseases is not fully understood. Recent studies have related the onset of neurological disorders to viral infections, which may cause neurological symptoms or lead to immune responses that trigger these pathological signs. Currently, this relationship is mostly based on epidemiological data on infections and seroprevalence of patients who present with neurological disorders. The number of studies aiming to elucidate the mechanism of action by which viral infections may directly or indirectly contribute to the development of neurological disorders has been increasing over the years but these studies are still scarce. Comprehending the pathogenesis of these diseases and exploring novel theories may favor the development of new strategies for diagnosis and therapy in the future. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to review the main pieces of evidence for the relationship between viral infection and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. Viruses belonging to the families Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, and Retroviridae have been reported to be involved in one or more of these conditions. Also, neurological symptoms and the future impact of infection with SARS-CoV-2, a member of the family Coronaviridae that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that started in late 2019, are reported and discussed.",
            "Neurological disorders (NDs) are among the most significant public health challenges in today’s society, and they are mainly associated with the aging of the population [1]. NDs are the leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), with approximately 276 million cases [2]. The continuous dysfunction provoked by NDs triggers degeneration and consequent cell death in the nervous system [3]. Although neurological disorders have a multifactorial etiology, most of them have a strong genetic and environmental association [4]. Recently, some studies have also associated NDs such as multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS), and epilepsy with viral infections [5–9]. Viral diseases are widely distributed, easily transmitted, and challenging to control. Thus, the hypothesis of viral agents as possible triggers of NDs makes them more impactful [10].",
            "The viral etiology of some neuroinfections is well described in the literature, especially those related to neurotropic viruses such as poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and enterovirus 71 (EV71). However, our understanding of the relationship between other viral infections and the development of neurological diseases is still limited. In addition, current ND challenges include the lack of reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and effective preventive strategies and treatments [11]. In this context, this work relates NDs, such as AD, PD, GBS, MS, and epilepsy, to viral infections. Moreover, we discuss the possible neurological impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is caused by the new coronavirus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "The first report of a central nervous system (CNS) infection with a consequent ND was by Bowery et al. in 1992 [12]. Subsequently, enterovirus (EV) and human herpesvirus (HHV) infections were found to be associated with ALS [13], Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus and Influenza virus with PD [14], herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and Chlamydia pneumoniae with AD [15], and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), HHV-6, and HHV-7 with MS [16]. Although studies have shown that MDs begin in the CNS, the brain-periphery relationship may influence the development and progression of these disorders [17].",
            "These disorders may be caused directly by infection of the CNS by specific pathogens or indirectly, through the host response to the infection. In case of the direct damage, some pathogens can cross the intact blood-brain barrier (BBB), causing severe encephalitis or acute infections that can be fatal or progress to chronic diseases [18]. Also, aging can make the CNS more vulnerable to infectious agents due to changes in the BBB, increased oxidative stress, and less energy production [19]. In the indirect-damage mechanism, various factors may be involved, such as the accumulation of protein aggregates, high levels of oxidative stress, alterations in autophagic mechanisms, synaptopathy, and neuronal destruction [16]. Fig. 1 illustrates the cascade of immune responses produced by the body against infections of the CNS and their deleterious effects.Fig. 1Pathological agents may infect the organism by different pathways, such as olfactory and gastric. These pathogens trigger a cascade of inflammatory responses (increased levels of cytokines, for example) that disrupt the BBB, activate microglia, and lead to a subsequent clustering around neuronal cells, resulting in neuronal damage.

            "In addition to the direct infection of CNS via blood and the BBB, other possible pathways involve monocyte-macrophage/microglia cells that can cross the BBB or inter- and trans-neuronal transfer in peripheral neurons (Fig. 2A). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), for example, crosses the BBB by infecting blood leukocytes and, subsequently, microglia [20]. Although HIV is not capable of attacking neurons directly, this infection provokes an increase in inflammatory cytokines and viral proteins that indirectly harm these cells [16].Fig. 2Mechanisms used by pathological agents to cross the BBB. (a) A direct crossing may be possible when cells of monocyte-macrophage/microglia lineage are infected by the pathogens and carry them through the BBB, reaching the CNS. This mechanism is also called \"Trojan horse\" because the microorganism eludes the immune system defense by using these cells to move from the bloodstream to the brain. The transport of pathogens to CNS is favored by inflammation, which is typically observed in neurological disorders. During the inflammation process, inflammatory molecules are released, triggering the activation of infected leukocytes. The postcapillary venule is attacked by the infected leukocytes, which encircle the endothelial and parenchyma basement membranes. Next, these cells enter the CNS by crossing the BBB. Another mechanism used by pathological agents is to impair the BBB and reach the CNS directly, using the porous capillaries of the choroid plexus. In various neurological diseases, the BBB is damaged, which favors the entry of pathogens into the brain through the bloodstream. (b) Neurotropic viruses may enter the CNS through retrograde axonal transport. These pathogens infect the peripheral nerve that creates a link from the skin and the mucosa to the sensory, motor, and olfactory neurons. In neuronal cells, viruses can replicate and infect adjacent cells. Source: adapted from De Chiara et al. (2012) [16]",

            "The neurotropism of some viruses is established through the nerves rooted in mucosa and skin. Infection is dependent on the recognition of receptors in sensory, motor, and olfactory neurons and retrograde axonal transport through axonal microtubules [21]. Certain viruses reach the brain through the olfactory system, which connects peripheral areas and with the CNS. Triplets and vagus nerves may also be an entry point for some viruses in intranasal infections [22]. After entering the CNS, viruses spread from cell to cell by being released in the synaptic cleft or by merging with neighboring neurons. The reinfection of peripheral tissue is possible for some viruses, which travel through anterograde transport and are released into the synaptic cleft [23]. The spread of neurotropic viruses in the CNS is illustrated in Fig. 2B. Several viruses have been associated with NDs, as described below.

            "Source: authors",
            "AD, described for the first time in 1906, is the most common type of dementia, and in approximately 95% of the cases, it occurs after 60 years of age. In young individuals, 13% of cases show an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. An increased amount of beta-amyloid (Aβ) is found in the brains of AD patients. This overproduction may be related to the mutation of the genes encoding presenilins I and II (PSEN1 and PSNE2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP). In addition to these mutations, early-onset AD may also be related to mutations in apolipoprotein E (apoE) and tau protein genes [24]. The etiology of late-onset AD is often associated with a complex synergy of factors, such as the susceptibility to multiple genes (the E4 allele of the apoE gene, for example) and environmental factors [25]. ApoE is essential for repairing damage to neurons by redistributing lipids to axons and regenerating Schwann cells, restoring synaptic-dendritic connections [26].",
            "One of the main characteristics of AD is the accumulation of Aβ peptide in the brain. Multiple forms of this peptide are derived from cleavage of the APP, the expression of which increases during cell stress [27]. The homeostasis of the CNS depend on the levels of Aβ in the brain, which assist in vital processes such as synapsis, calcium homeostasis, neurogenesis, the antioxidant system, and metal ion capture [28]. An altered level of Aβ peptide leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils. In a cascade of events, amyloid fibrils trigger amyloid plaques and formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), causing a loss of synapses and neuronal death [29].",
            "Another factor associated with AD is the tau protein, which contributes to the assembly and stabilization of microtubules [30] and is important in the regulation of plasticity and synaptic function [31]. Under physiological conditions, phosphorylation of tau proteins for binding to microtubules occurs in a balanced way. However, when they are hyperphosphorylated, tau proteins undergo conformational changes leading to the formation of NFTs, destabilization of associated microtubules, synaptic damage, and neurodegeneration [29]. In addition to amyloid plaques and NFTs, the presence of extensive oxidative stress and dysregulation of calcium homeostasis are also characteristic of an AD patient’s brain [32]. Aβ can promote cellular calcium overload, inducing associated oxidative stress and formation of pores in the cell membrane [33]. Oxidative stress can increase Aβ production and tau hyperphosphorylation, promoting the onset and progression of AD [34]. Other events may influence the pathogenesis of AD, such as defective autophagy [35], mitochondrial dysfunction [36], synaptic dysfunction [37], and neuroinflammation [38]. AD causes several types of tissue damage, including brain atrophy, loss of neurons, and amyloid angiopathy [39].",
            "Tests for the presence of microorganisms in the nervous system of patients with AD manifestations have yielded positive results for fungi [40, 41], bacteria [15], and viruses such as CMV, HSV-1, HHV-6, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Unlike the brains of young patients, postmortem examination of the brains of elderly people with AD has shown them to be positive for HSV-1 DNA [42]. Seropositivity for HSV has already been associated with the development of AD in other studies [43–45]. Reactivation of HSV-1 in the CNS has been suggested to be the main connection between HSV-1 infection and AD development. This reactivation triggers an inflammatory process, causing damage to the cells, along with formation of amyloid plaques and NFTs [7]. The HSV-1 glycoprotein B (gB) is 67% identical to the Aβ peptide. In an in vitro study, gB promoted the development of Aβ fibrils in primary cortical neurons, causing cytotoxicity [46]. Decreased Aβ clearance and the accumulation of amyloid plaques in AD can impair cell autophagy [47]. Neuroblastoma cells infected with HSV-1 also produce hyperphosphorylated tau protein [48]. ApoE seems to have a strong correlation with HSV-1 lip infection in the peripheral nervous system, with the E4 allele being present in 60% of those infected [42]. In mice infected with HSV-1, viral DNA concentrations in the brain were 13.7 times higher in apoE +/+ wild-type mice than in apoE -/- knockout mice. Also, HSV-1 infection induces the expression of cytokines and proinflammatory molecules that can cause oxidative damage [49]. In human neuroblastoma cells infected with HSV-1, experimentally induced oxidative stress has been shown to significantly increase the accumulation of intracellular Aβ, inhibit Aβ secretion, and potentiate the accumulation of autophagic compartments within the cell [50].",
            "Another HHV related to AD is CMV. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with higher levels of CMV IgG have more significant cognitive decline and a higher risk of developing AD [51–53]. Also, 93% of brains with vascular dementia that were examined postmortem were positive for CMV [54]. CMV-specific CD8+ T cells produce increased amounts of proinflammatory IFN-γ and decreased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-2 and IL-4, with a potential shift to a proinflammatory cytokine profile in elderly people [55]. Serum levels of CMV-specific IgG have been shown to be significantly associated with NFTs. An increase in IFN-γ was also detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of more than 80% of subjects who were positive for CMV [56].",
            "HHV-6 rarely causes serious CNS complications; however, its ability to establish latency in the brain with possible reactivation under conditions of immunosuppression may relate this virus to AD development [57]. HHV-6 has been found in the brain [58] and leukocytes of AD patients, being significantly associated with the development of the disease and the cognitive decline of these individuals [52]. It has been suggested that HHV-6 deregulates autophagy and activates a stress response in the endoplasmic reticulum in various types of cells, particularly in astrocytes. The reduction of autophagy increases the production of Aβ and activates the stress response in the endoplasmic reticulum, promoting hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein [59].",
            "Studies have also suggested a relationship between HCV and AD. It has been proposed that this occurs thorough direct viral infection in the brain or through cerebral or systemic inflammation [60]. In the first hypothesis, HCV can infect monocytes/macrophages, cross the BBB, and provoke the secretion of large amounts of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), causing cytotoxicity in the brain tissue. In the second hypothesis, HCV activates the immune system, triggering excessive systemic or local inflammation [61].",
            "PD is a neurodegenerative motor disease, initially described by James Parkinson as “paralysis agitans” [62]. Approximately 10 million people are living with PD worldwide. Four percent of PD patients are under the age of 50, and the incidence of this disease increases with age [63]. An epidemiological study based on a North American population has suggested that, by 2030, over 1.2 million people will be living with PD [64]. This disease is characterized by motor changes, cognitive impairment, and autonomic dysfunction [65]. The damage caused by PD is related to dopaminergic neuron degeneration that occurs in the nigrostriatal pathway. The reduction of striatal dopamine modulation is also responsible for disease signs [66]. These alterations happen not only in the substantia nigra (SN) but also in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and peripheral neurons [67].",
            "Lewy bodies are formed mainly by α-synuclein, neurofilament proteins, and ubiquitin. It is suspected that presynaptic α-synuclein is the main protein involved in the formation of these bodies. Genetic or epigenetic factors may be responsible for their appearance in neurons. The PD development is related to the protein aggregates formed inside the nerve cells and their location in the brain. That is, if Lewy bodies are located in the nigrostriatal pathway, they would be related to extrapyramidal manifestations; in autonomic ganglia, postural hypotension; in the limbic cortex, psychosis; and, in the neocortex, cognitive decline [68, 69].",
            "A D620N mutation in vacuolar sorting protein 35 (VPS35) causes subcellular retromer complex dysfunction; therefore, it is believed that it may affect the pathogenesis of PD. An alteration in retromer cargo molecule trafficking, a reduction of cell survival, and alteration of α-synuclein processing were observed when the D620N mutation was present. The retromer complex is also used by viral and bacterial pathogens to aid in their assembly, replication, and movement within the cell and as a mechanism to avoid the destruction that may be triggered by the cell defense machinery [70].",
            "After the H1N1 pandemic in 1918, the number of cases of post-encephalitic parkinsonism and lethargic encephalitis increased. Based on this fact, a “dual-hit hypothesis” was suggested regarding PD pathogenesis. It was proposed that microorganisms may enter the host via the intestinal mucosa and attack the nervous system. These neurotropic agents may infect the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and trigger neurodegenerative events [71].",
            "Although rare, experimental evidence has shown that some influenza A viruses are neurotropic, moving into the nervous system following systemic infection [72–74]. H5N1 influenza virus was used to infect the CNS of mice. A continuing inflammatory response in the animals’ brains was demonstrated after the viral infection, which may have induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons [8]. The H1N1 influenza virus does not appear to be neurotropic in mice, suggesting that the peripheral immune response activated after an infection is probably responsible for the secondary inflammation observed in the CNS [75].",
            "HHV infection is also associated with PD development. Elevated serological test values and the presence of serum inflammatory cytokines and α-synuclein support this theory. Moreover, studies suggest a relationship between viral load and the severity of PD symptoms [76]. Scientists have proposed a role of molecular mimicry between HSV-1 (region Ul4222-36) and α-synuclein (αsyn100-114). In the membrane of SNpc dopaminergic neurons, this phenomenon may trigger aggregation of α-synuclein and subsequent neuronal degeneration. A similar mechanism is observed for EBV, with molecular mimicry between a repeat region in latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) encoded by EBV and the C-terminal region of α-synuclein, inducing its oligomerization [77]. HSV-1 infection may be associated with secretion of TNF-α, which is known to be involved in PD pathogenesis. It has been reported that dopaminergic neurons are very susceptible to TNF-α, which may affect the cells’ plasticity, and that neuronal death can occur in response to TNF-α binding to its receptors [78].",
            "Parkinsonism symptoms were described in a patient who demonstrated HHV-6 infection reactivation after transplantation. Brain injuries may indicate parainfectious cytotoxic changes, direct CNS invasion, or immunologically mediated mechanisms [79]. Immunological reactivation may also be related to the development of PD in CMV infection. Dendritic cells, which preferentially secrete proinflammatory cytokines, are in higher numbers in patients with CMV and PD than in patients with CMV without PD [80]. In addition, the possible immunogens presented by these cells may be derived from dopaminergic neurons, triggering an autoimmune response to neuromelanin [81].",
            "Studies suggest that patients who have previously been infected with HCV are more likely to develop PD. HCV may replicate in the CNS, triggering a higher prevalence of mental illness in chronic HCV patients than in the general population [82]. Dopaminergic neurotoxicity after HCV infection has been observed in co-cultured neuron-glial cells from rats. Also, it has been suggested that HCV infection induces positive regulation of ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed, and secreted) chemokines [83]. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), which is responsible for neuronal survival, is downregulated by HCV [71]. The entry and replication of this virus in the CNS may be facilitated by the high level of expression of HCV receptors in the brain microvascular endothelium [84]. Despite this fact, no correlation was found between HCV infection and PD development when more than one million patients were studied in the USA [85]. The discrepancy in the results was suggested by the substantial difference in the geographic areas of the studies, considering the prevalence of the infection, pathogenic profile of the genotype, variability of extrahepatic manifestation, and association with comorbidities.",
            "Patients infected with HIV may develop parkinsonian features. This movement disorder may be triggered by a cascade of events caused by the infection, such as basal ganglia dysfunction, BBB alteration, chronic neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration [86]. Post-mortem autopsies demonstrated signs of HIV in the brain, mostly in inflammatory infiltrates and glial cells, and a higher prevalence of α-synuclein in SNpc [87]. DJ1 regulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and dopamine transmission in neurons, whereas leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mediates neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Studies suggest that HIV infection may influence DJ1 and LRRK2 levels [88].",
            "Epilepsy is an ND characterized by the rapid occurrence of epileptic seizures due to abnormal or excessive brain/neuronal activity [89]. An individual can also be diagnosed with epilepsy if he or she experiences an unprovoked or reflexive seizure and has at least a 60% chance of developing another seizure in the next 10 years [90]. Approximately 20% of all epilepsy cases are caused by acute CNS insults, 11% by cerebrovascular accident, 6% by traumatic brain injury, and 4% by infections [91]. Changes associated with post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) include hemosiderin deposition with an incompletely formed wall of gliosis [92] and persistent BBB disruption. A correlation is also found between late-poststroke seizures and BBB disruption [93]. Post-injury epilepsy develops most commonly in the temporal and frontal lobes [94]. PTE and some infections cause an initial lesion, and if it is outside of the temporal lobes, it may result in seizures due to mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) [94, 95]. After an injury, the latency time for the development of seizures may vary, suggesting possible variability in mechanisms of epileptogenesis [91]. Surgical specimens from patients with epilepsy show common pathological features that may be relevant to the epileptogenic process, such as astrocytes activated at the BBB, inflammatory cellular infiltrates, extravasation of blood, severe injury, disruption of the BBB with encephalitis, and involvement of frontal or temporal lobes. The majority of these features are associated with inflammatory responses [91, 94].",
            "Inflammation in the CNS may participate in the progression of epileptogenesis as well as in the induction of seizures [96]. The progression of seizures depends on several factors. This cascade of events includes exacerbated generation of inflammatory factors, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, and activation of inflammatory mediators, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), for example [97]. Depending on its receptor, TNF-α may act as a pro-convulsant via TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) or an anti-convulsant through TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) [98]. Similar to other proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and TNF-α, IL-6 signaling may activate NF-κB transcriptional signaling and induce the synthesis of PGE2 by COX-2. These physiological changes assist in regulating immune and inflammatory responses [99]. The overexpression of TNF-α or IL-6 in mice leads to chronic inflammation in the brain, predisposing to seizures [100].",
            "A great diversity of viruses has been associated with epilepsy [13, 101, 102]. One hypothesis suggests that common childhood viral infections can generate acute and chronic inflammatory processes in the CNS, which increases BBB permeability and neuronal excitability [103]. Acute seizures and epilepsy have been linked to HHV-6 infections, especially in children [104]. The number of HHV-6 infections associated with mesial temporal or temporal lobe epilepsy range from 9.1% to 55.6% [5, 105]. However, many HHV-6 infections are not associated with epilepsy, and the association of this virus with ND is controversial [106–109]. HHV-6 has a tropism for glial cells, and as the nasal cavity is constituted of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), the virus can replicate and cause a significant increase in the production of IL-6, chemokine ligand 1 (CCL-1), and CCL-5 [110].",
            "HVS-1 is the leading agent of viral encephalitis, with an incidence of 2 or 3 cases per million people, per year [111]. Studies suggest that encephalitis caused by HSV-1 replication increases the likelihood of spontaneous seizures and epilepsy by approximately 20%. This fact is due to the involvement of the frontotemporal cortex, including the hippocampus, elevated CSF opening pressure, and signs of cerebral hernia [112, 113]. When viral replication is activated during latency, HSV-1 can ascend through the trigeminal and olfactory nerves to the frontal and temporal lobes, spreading to other regions of the brain [114]. HSV-1 infections trigger an inflammatory response, recruiting activated leukocytes, which, when repeated continuously, may cause brain tissue damage and neurological sequelae [111].",
            "Less commonly, CMV and EBV may also cause nonparaneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis, which has been related to late-onset epilepsy. Antineuronal autoantibodies were detected in 48 of 113 patients with epilepsy and suspected autoimmune encephalitis [115]. The relationship between epilepsy and congenital CMV infection indicates that the 37% of the patients developed epilepsy at approximately 20 months of age [116]. CMV infection may affect the fetus directly via virally encoded gene products that may impair vital cellular processes, such as the cell cycle, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis, or induce inflammatory responses, trigger vascular injury, and promote evasion of host immune responses [117]. Increased expression of late CMV genes has been reported in individuals with intractable epilepsy, in addition to higher levels of CMV-IgG and CMV-IgM, highly sensitive C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) and IL-6, suggesting increased viral replication and inflammatory responses in these patients [118].",
            "It is known that several arboviruses can cause meningitis, encephalitis, and encephalomyelitis [119]. Verma and Varathanaj [120] reported a case of epilepsia partialis continua associated with dengue virus (DENV) encephalitis. Although seizures occur in approximately 47% of encephalitis cases caused by DENV, it is not possible to establish a causal relationship between encephalitis and the epileptic condition. According to Guabiraba et al. [121], there is currently no specific in vivo model that can demonstrate the relationship of epileptic manifestations and the pathogenesis of DENV infection. Trials were conducted in AG129 mice, which are deficient in interferon (IFN) types I and II and are highly susceptible to DENV infection [122]. When these animals were infected intraperitoneally with a neurotropic strain of DENV-2, 100% paralysis and lethality was demonstrated [123].",
            "The prevalence and incidence of epilepsy and seizures among HIV patients are higher than in the general population. About 5 to 10% of HIV-positive patients in developed countries present with seizures or epilepsy [124]. It is known that HIV can invade neural tissue; however, there is still no proof of the relationship between the damage caused by the virus and seizures. Factors that may be associated with seizures and epilepsy in HIV-positive patients include the course of the disease and the establishment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), opportunistic infections, and metabolic disorders [125]. Also, HIV infection can induce the formation of autoantibodies, causing neuronal death, with increased glutamate exocytosis and decreased recapture. Glutamate depletion is associated with the activation of calcium channels stimulated by phosphorylation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors by kinases arising from the activation of IL-1 receptors, causing neuronal hyperexcitability, with a consequent decrease in the seizure threshold [126–128].",
            "MS is an immune-mediated disease in which the myelin sheath of CNS neurons is injured and the communication between the muscles and the brain is progressively interrupted [129]. The International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS classifies four basic courses for this disease: clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, and primary progressive. The most frequent kind of MS is relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) [130]. Patients may exhibit cognitive deficits, such as difficulties in processing information and impairment of working memory and attention, as well as balance, locomotion, and fine motor control [131, 132]. Spasticity is a common symptom in MS patients. This condition is characterized by hyperreflexia, spasms, poor muscle tone, and pain, causing severe functional disability, which compromise the quality of life of these patients [133]. The prevalence of MS varies worldwide, reaching 12.8 out of every 100,000 inhabitants in Asia [134], 290 in Canada, 203 in the United Kingdom, 189 in Sweden, and 3.2 in Ecuador [135].",
            "Although the etiology of MS is still uncertain, immunological, genetic, and environmental risk factors have been proposed. Immunological factors that trigger MS are related to T cells and antibodies, which are autoreactive in these patients. Inhibitory molecules, which generally regulate adaptive system activation, are impaired and are not able to suppress uncontrolled immune responses in MS patients. As a consequence, the chronic inflammation process leads to further damage [136]. Family clustering and specific genetic characteristics are being examined as risk factors for MS. While the general population shows a 0.1% risk of recurrence, first-degree relatives of MS index cases have up to a 50-fold greater risk of developing the disease. Moreover, smoking, body mass index, and vitamin D are among the environmental factors that may influence the onset of this disease [137, 138]. Although the etiology of MS is multifactorial, viral infections are mentioned as one of the disease’s environmental risk factors.",
            "When analyzing the relationship between HHV-6 and EBV infections and MS, higher titers of antibodies against these viruses and a higher seroprevalence were found in patients with the disease when compared to healthy paired-control subjects [139]. The first evidence correlating EBV infection and MS was the fact that MS patients’ B lymphocytes carry and transport EBV antigens [140]. Subsequently, other evidence was suggested, such as genetic susceptibility and EBV infection, as a higher risk of MS was found in individuals with infectious mononucleosis (IM) [141, 142]. The indirect effect of EBV on MS onset may be related to the activation of silent human endogenous retrovirus W (HERV-W) [143]. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the envelope protein (Env) of HERV-W may trigger inflammatory responses and cause cytotoxicity, as well as cell death [144, 145]. Another hypothesis suggested a cascade of events evolving EBV, B cells, T cells, and inflammation processes. In healthy seropositive individuals, the immune system manages to regulate the memory B cells against the latent virus, so there are no further complications. However, in individuals who are genetically predisposed to MS, memory B cells can cross the BBB and trigger an inflammatory response in the CNS and, consequently, germinal-center-like structures. T cells may be activated at this point, and the infected cells, although latent and with limited viral gene expression, may act as antigen-presenting cells. After differentiation, some infected memory B cells can trigger the EBV replicative cycle and the production of virions. In diseases such as MS, microglia and astrocytes are chronically activated, causing neurotoxicity [146].",
            "Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is an essential glycoprotein involved in the myelination process in CNS nerves. MOG is also responsible for ensuring the structural integrity of the myelin sheath [147]. Changes in MOG have been experimentally associated with B cells infected with EBV, which convert the destructive processing of MOG into productive processing. This conversion facilitates the cross-presentation of the pathogenic MOG epitope (residues 40-48) to autoaggressive cytotoxic T cells [148]. Additionally, studies have shown that during primary EBV infection, this virus may induce an increase in BBB permeability, which allows pre-existing polyclonal antibody-producing B cells to penetrate the CNS. This event could explain the lower levels of EBV-specific IgG antibodies in the CNS compared to IgG produced against other viruses [149, 150].",
            "When relating HHV-6A and HHV-6B with MS, HHV-6A was more prevalent in serum and urine samples of patients with MS than HHV-6B [151, 152]. The first murine model of HHV-6-induced brain infection was developed by Reynaud et al. [153]. First, these researchers studied different transgenic mouse lines and their ability to express the receptor for HHV-6, CD46. Further results showed that HHV-6A, but not HHV-6B, triggered the expression of viral transcripts in primary brain glial cultures from CD46-expressing mice. HHV-6B DNA did not persist in the brain, decreasing rapidly after the infection, while HHV-6A DNA levels remained high for up to 9 months. Immunohistological analysis showed the infiltration of lymphocytes in the periventricular region of mice infected with HHV-6A. Moreover, this virus triggered production of proinflammatory chemokines such as CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CC-chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10). A recent study measured IgG reactivity against HHV-6A and HHV-6B immediate-early protein 1 (IE1A and IE1B) and showed a positive association between IgG response against IE1A and an increased risk of developing MS in the future. In contrast, a negative association between the IgG response against IE1B and MS was demonstrated. Therefore, this study supports the role of HHV-6A in the etiology of MS by showing an increase in serological response against the immediate-early protein of this virus [154]. Oligodendrocytes are myelin-producing cells that are targeted by the immune system of patients with MS. The latency established by HHV-6A in oligodendrocytes may contribute, or even trigger, this unwanted autoimmune reaction, which leads to myelin impairment [155]. In patients with MS, in addition to the ongoing destruction of myelin, impairment in myelin repair by differentiating OPC is observed [156].",
            "GBS is characterized by a dysfunction in the peripheral nerve, which suggests that immune and inflammatory mechanisms are involved [157]. Its main clinical manifestations are the absence of reflexes, paresthesia with sensory loss, and motor weakness [158]. Classification of GBS into subtypes depends on the underlying pathology, clinical presentation, and neurophysiological features. The most common subtypes include the following: acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), acute axonal motor neuropathy (AMAN), acute motor-sensory axonal polyneuropathy (AMSAN), and Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) [159].",
            "In GBS, antibodies and inflammatory cells produced in response to infections cross-react with epitopes on peripheral nerves and roots, leading to demyelination or axonal damage [160]. Macrophages initiate damage to the peripheral nervous system (PNS) by producing and secreting matrix metalloproteinases and nitric oxide. As a consequence, activated T cells release proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α [161]. The humoral response is initiated through activation of B cells, and antigen-antibody interactions can activate the complement system, resulting in membrane attack complex (MAC) formation and leading to nerve cell membrane damage and destruction [162]. Multiple antecedents and potentially triggering events have been reported. The association with infections has been established for Campylobacter jejuni, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and the viruses CMV, EBV, influenza A virus, and Zika virus [163]. Some genetic and environmental factors that affect the susceptibility of individuals to the disease have also been described [164].",
            "Cases of patients with a combination of HSV-1 and GBS are suggested by the occurrence of molecular mimicry and high serum anti-GQ1b IgG antibody titers, causing inflammatory nerve damage [165–167]. Infection with HSV-1 could cause a change in the ganglioside composition of neuronal and glial cell surfaces, followed by the activation of autoantibodies in patients with antiganglioside antibodies [168]. Molecular mimicry is also proposed between CMV and GBS, which is the most frequent infectious etiology of GB, described for the first time by Klemola et al. [169]. Patients with CMV who develop GBS have high levels of anti-GM2 antibodies in their CSF and serum. In these people, carbohydrate structures similar to the GM2 ganglioside may induce antiganglioside antibodies [170]. Also, autoantibodies against moesin, which is crucial for myelination, have been demonstrated in 83% of patients with CMV-GBS. This may be due to six consecutive amino acids that are identical in moesin and CMV phosphoprotein 85 [171].",
            "Although studies have associated HHV-6 infection with GBS development, this theory is generally based on minimal observations such as significantly higher antibody titers to HHV-6 in GBS patients compared to control groups [172]. This persistence of HHV-6 antibodies in the serum can be due to a stronger antigen-antibody reaction or to polyclonal B cell activation. Reactivation of latent HHV-6 infection has also been considered, but the influence of HHV-6 in GBS etiology is still inconclusive due to the lack of experimental studies [162]. The neurological involvement of EBV is also unusual, but it should be treated as a post-infection disease due to the abnormal immunological response observed [173]. Grose and Feorino [174] described five cases of GBS with high levels of antibodies to EBV, even in the absence of IM. Multivariate analysis showed that of 154 GBS patients, 10% had serologic evidence of recent EBV infection [6]. It has been suggested that the virus has a predilection for B lymphocytes and that it activates polyclonal B cells with increased production of immunoglobulins [175]. Other studies have suggested that EBV may infect endothelial cells and trigger vascular damage or cause vessel inflammation mediated by the immune complex, which could trigger the development of GBS [162].",
            "The envelope of the influenza A virus consists of a lipid bilayer containing several glycoproteins, such as neuraminidase (NA) and haemagglutinin (HA). Therefore, anti-glycolipid antibodies may be produced during influenza virus infection because of possible molecular mimicry between glycoproteins of influenza viruses and glycolipids localized in human peripheral nerves [176].",
            "Infectious hepatitis has been associated with GBS etiology. The case of a patient with manifested distal paresis of both legs and arms with areflexia and paresthesia was studied by De Klippel and collaborators [177]. Scientists believe the disease onset occurred during the pre-convalescent phase of an acute HCV infection, when the level of liver enzymes was consistently and rapidly normalized and signs of fibrosis were found in this organ. GBS may also occur in patients with chronic HCV infection, albeit rarely [178]. The reactivation of the virus or its intense replication may trigger the development of GBS [179]. A case of severe GBS was related to chronic active HCV infection and mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) [180]. Other findings, such as immune complex accumulation in the vascular endothelium and vasculitis over the nerve, may explain the relationship between the infection and GBS onset [162]. A few cases of peripheral neuropathy secondary to chronic HCV infection have been described. These cases were often associated with cryoglobulinemia or with anti-myelin-associated-glycoprotein (MAG) antibodies [181].",
            "Scientific studies were performed on the relationship between DENV infection and GBS. The infection may directly influence the disease or trigger postinfectious autoimmune responses that might lead to GBS [171]. Several studies on DENV infection have demonstrated abnormal immune responses, including cytokine and chemokine production, complement activation, and immune cell activation. Shah [182] suggested that proinflammatory cytokines that participate in the immune response in dengue fever might play a causal role in the etiopathogenesis of GBS. This infection may cause the generation of a complex immune response, with high levels of TNFα, IL-2, and IFNγ, as well as an inversion of the CD4:CD8 ratio [183]. Also, autoimmune responses may be involved, mainly in the pathogenesis of the severe phase of dengue. Patients with dengue can produce antibodies that cross-react with platelets and endothelial cells. After DENV infection, antibodies against nonstructural protein 1 (anti-NS1) are generated. Studies suggest these antibodies may influence the cross-reactivity of endothelial cells, which play a crucial role in the development of neurological disease [184].",
            "One of the proposed mechanisms for GBS in HIV-1-infected patients includes a direct action of an HIV-1 neurotropic strain on the nerves. Another theory is based on an autoimmune response, in which abnormal immunoregulation is followed by the formation of antibodies against myelin [185]. HIV can cause direct and indirect neurotoxic effects on the CNS and PNS. The relationship between GBS and the stage of HIV infection is also unclear. The authors characterized the GBS as an indication of early HIV infection or seroconversion [186]. However, GBS has been reported in chronic HIV-1 infection cases or as a complication of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in severely immunocompromised patients [187]. The HIV-1 infection may alter the integrity of the BBB through the action of the viral proteins Tat, gp120, and Nef [188]. In a study using a murine model, exposure to HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 caused swelling and increased TNFα levels in the sciatic nerve trunk. These findings suggest that HIV infection may cause nerve damage [189].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is the virus responsible for the disease COVID-19 [190], a global pandemic that started in late 2019 and in a few months has affected 250 countries around the world [191]. Coronaviruses (CoVs) typically cause respiratory disease in humans; however, some studies suggest an association with neurological symptoms. Two different coronaviruses that caused epidemic infections in the past, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have triggered neurological harm in isolated cases [192]. Patients infected by these viruses have developed neurologic symptoms, such as neuropathy, myopathy, Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE), and GBS, two to three weeks after the appearance of typical symptoms [193, 194]. The causality cannot be proven, since these findings were reported in isolated cases and with a small number of patients. On the other hand, some scientists have suggested that the neurological manifestations of MERS might have been neglected and underdiagnosed [193].",
            "In Wuhan, China, a study was performed during the COVID-19 outbreak with 214 patients. The results showed that 36.4% of the patients with severe disease exhibited neurologic manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular disease, impairment of consciousness, and skeletal muscle symptoms [195]. A study performed in Strasbourg, France, demonstrated that 84% of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units (ICU) who had respiratory difficulties also showed neurological symptoms such as agitation, confusion, and signs of corticospinal tract dysfunction [196]. It has been suggested that these signs of neurological damage might be caused by severe hypoxemia and hypoxia, an inflammatory process triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, or by virus infiltration and spread in the brain [197]. The SARS-CoV-2 infection begins with the spike protein S1 binding to the host receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). The human brain expresses ACE2 at a high level, which may allow the virus to invade the CNS [198]. Xiang et al. [199] reported the first confirmed case of encephalitis caused by SARS-CoV-2. The presence of this virus in the CSF of this patient was confirmed by genome sequencing. The first case of meningitis associated with COVID-19 was reported by Moriguchi et al. [200]. Although nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from this patient were negative, the infection was confirmed by viral RNA detection in the spinal fluid.",
            "COVID-19 triggers increased production of inflammatory cells, and along with them, high levels of inflammatory cytokines, which induce immune-mediated processes [201], and this is one of the proposed explanations for GBS symptoms [202]. Sedaghat and Karimi [203] reported the development of GBS in a 65-year-old male COVID-19 patient two weeks after developing cough and fever. In another case study, the first GBS symptoms overlapped with the period of SARS-CoV-2 infection, making investigators unsure about the causal connection between the two [204].",
            "A patient with well-controlled post-encephalitic epilepsy was infected with SARS-CoV-2 and presented with focal status epilepticus in the early stage of the disease. The 78-year-old patient was seizure-free for more than two years, and based on a historical correlation of symptoms, it was suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might have triggered the seizures [205]. The relationship between COVID-19 and epilepsy is still unknown, and conclusions will depend on new reports and updates from clinicians [206].",
            "A study of 90 brain autopsy samples from patients with NDs (mostly MS) and healthy controls showed that 48% of the samples contained human coronavirus RNA [207]. However, further studies should be performed to determine if the presence of virus in human brains is opportunistic or disease-associated. It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely to trigger demyelination similar to MS. Based on this fact, periodic neurological assessments, such as auditory brainstem responses and neuroimaging, should be carried out on recovered COVID-19 patients to follow up any signs of dysfunction [199]. When comparing COVID-19 with past viral pandemics, a concern about neuropsychiatric sequelae emerges. Previous outbreaks of virus infection have triggered long-term neurodegenerative effects such as encephalopathy, psychosis, demyelinating processes, and neuromuscular dysfunction, weeks, or even months after the patient’s recovery [208]. Therefore, Troyer et al. [209] have also emphasized the need for long-term monitoring of patients who were once infected with SARS-CoV-2. Several neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, PD, and MS, are related to high levels of cytokines/chemokines and other chronic neuroinflammation effects [210]. In this way, the cytokine storm triggered by COVID-19 and BBB disruption could affect the CNS and cause the onset of these diseases [211, 212]. However, further studies should be conducted to investigate the involvement of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neurodegenerative diseases [211].",
            "In this review, we have discussed a number of studies that relate viral infections to the development of neurological disorders. It is important to consider that viruses are responsible for various epidemics and even pandemics, and some of them can cause irreversible damage to the nervous system. This work demonstrates that considerable attention should be given to the relationship between viral infections and NDs. The inclusion of viruses in the etiology and diagnosis of diseases of the nervous system would have a positive impact on the management and treatment of disabling and potentially lethal complications. New studies that investigate the mechanism of action of the viruses in these pathologies should be encouraged, aiming mainly at the development of novel control and intervention therapies.",

            "It is well accepted that environmental stressors experienced over a one’s life, from microbial infections to chemical toxicants to even psychological stressors, ultimately shape central nervous system (CNS) functioning but can also contribute to its eventual breakdown. The severity, timing and type of such environmental “hits”, woven together with genetic factors, likely determine what CNS outcomes become apparent. This focused review assesses the current COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of a multi-hit framework and disuses how the SARS-COV-2 virus (causative agent) might impact the brain and potentially interact with other environmental insults. What the long-term consequences of SAR2 COV-2 upon neuronal processes is yet unclear, but emerging evidence is suggesting the possibility of microglial or other inflammatory factors as potentially contributing to neurodegenerative illnesses. Finally, it is critical to consider the impact of the virus in the context of the substantial psychosocial stress that has been associated with the global pandemic. Indeed, the loneliness, fear to the future and loss of social support alone has exerted a massive impact upon individuals, especially the vulnerable very young and the elderly. The substantial upswing in depression, anxiety and eating disorders is evidence of this and in the years to come, this might be matched by a similar spike in dementia, as well as motor and cognitive neurodegenerative diseases.",
            "Sophisticated defensive strategies have evolved to protect the sensitive neuronal cells and their circuitry from environmental xenobiotic and pathogenic threats. This includes not only the obvious blockades provided by the blood brain barrier (BBB) and the blood cerebrospinal barrier, but also the specialized cells of the immune system [71]. The brain’s specialized immunocompetent cell, the microglia, plays a major role in this regard, along with important support from astroglial cells [61, 73]. Although tightly regulated, the entry of peripheral immune cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells and T and B lymphocytes, can also occur and this process is greatly upregulated during times of cellular distress or microbial invasion [108, 127]. These processes generally result in neutralization or elimination of the threat and may result in certain cases, in long-term protection. However, there is also the possibility that such exposures might prime inflammatory cascades, such that the magnitude of future threats might be exaggerated. This idea of a sensitization of neuroinflammatory cascades has been applied to the understanding of how neurodegenerative disease might evolve over time with repeated environmental stressor exposures [8, 79]. There is also the thought that the distress caused by combined pathogenic along with xenobiotic “hits” might simply act to cumulatively add up to exceed some threshold that will eventually result in pathology ensuing [46, 110, 113]. The nature of pathology that develops with repeated environmental hits of course, depends upon one’s genetic constitution and what “weak links” a person possess. Ultimately however, it is important to consider how parallel changes in peripheral immunity and organ systems interact the central nervous system (CNS) in the context of repeated xenobiotic and pathogenic threats.",
            "At the heart of most neurological diseases, there is a some degree of infiltration of peripheral inflammatory immune cells, along with activation of local glial cells [12, 20, 68, 97, 108]. Accordingly, animal models of  neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (PD), are characterized by a substantial neuroinflammatory component [7, 21, 27]. Moreover, administration of immunogenic challenges, such as high doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), murine hepatitis virus (MHV) or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), can induce marked activation of microglial cells and astrocytes and in some cases lead to peripheral immune cell infiltration or even neuronal death, coupled with behavioral deficits [8, 79, 84, 136]. Intriguingly, even neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia, have also been linked to an over-activation of the inflammatory immune system, albeit without obvious neuronal loss [1, 2, 5, 53, 67]. In fact, even psychological stressors, if sufficient, can stimulate immune cell mobilization and the release of soluble inflammatory factors, including a variety of cytokines [34, 100].",
            "With the current coronavirus disease (COVID19) pandemic underway and its far-reaching global impact, it is of particular importance to consider the long-term psychiatric and neurological consequences that will ensue over the next few years, as well as the possible ripple effects on brain health that still might be felt decades later. Individuals can be impacted by the virus itself or from the secondary stress associated with it, including the fearfulness, loneliness and loss of social ties. Consistent with the theme of this review, the COVID19 pandemic itself may be thought of comprising a series of “hits” (including the pathogenic effects of the virus itself or the isolation, loneliness and sense of lack of control that characterizes the psychosocial aspects of pandemic) that collectively can impact neuroimmune functioning. Such “pandemic hits” would be expected to have differential effects on individuals, depending upon what environmental or stressful insults that have already been experienced over one’s lifetime. Of course, the impact of future threats or stresses would likewise be shaped by one’s stressor history. It is also of upmost importance to bear in mind that microbial agents, such as those of the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) family which cause COVID19, can impact multiple biological systems and the inter-connections between these different systems might be crucially alerted. Indeed, in the current pandemic there have been reported a number of co-morbidities, ranging from gastrointestinal, depressive symptoms, olfactory disturbances and cognitive difficulties [10, 24, 64, 131]. This review seeks to explore the impact of the coronavirus and the pandemic conditions upon the neuroimmune system and place in context, the potential mechanisms through which viral invasion might interact with other environmental threats or individual vulnerabilities to influence long-term CNS outcomes.",
            "It is believed that some of the earliest cellular creatures on earth possess some rudimentary immune-like apparatus that allowed for defence and maintenance of homeostasis. This would include bacteria, viruses and other parasites that would have existed during such ancient times. Hence, the earliest sensing mechanisms that allows for extracellular interactions likely would have been immune based. Essentially, the immune system would act to detect and provide protection from various stressors. This would have placed co-evolutionary pressure on evolving multicellular organisms and single-celled pathogens to develop more sophisticated and “sneaky” detection apparatus over time. At the same time, it could have also paved the wave for more complex sensing strategies that allowed for communication between multicellular organisms. Such grouping behaviors or “cell social” aggregations could endow further benefits against potential pathogens and would require substantial energetic input and sophisticated structures.",
            "Over time, highly complex organisms evolved further sensing capacities that went beyond typical immune based pathogenic threat detection and developed more general threat detection systems. It is conceivable that such evolving sophisticated systems tapped into and elaborated upon existing immune and CNS processes. Indeed, evidence of the co-evolution of the CNS and immune systems is suggested based on the relatively high number of brain antigens that have been implicated in autoimmune disease. To this end, enzymes or receptors for the neurotransmitters GABA (GAD65) and acetylcholine (AchR), as well as myelin, laminin and tyrosine hydroxylase are targeted in several autoimmune diseases, including diabetes, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis [92]. It is curious that only a small subset of the relatively limitless number possible antigens are responsible for such autoimmune diseases and that these tend to be found in abundance in the CNS. Further still, it is intriguing to note that autoimmunity linked to tumors or infectious agents disproportionately targets brain antigens, such as myelin [92]. Hence, there is reason to believe that the CNS might house many such “super-autoantigens” capable of overcoming the normal inhibitory restraints of the immune system. It is also conceivable that this might be linked to the evolutionary pressures that shaped bi-directional brain–immune cooperation. In effect, such antigens might be vestiges from past mechanisms for immune protection of the brain or even as a means to foster synaptic plasticity and/or coordinate widespread nascent neural circuits.",
            "The co-evolution of brain and immune systems has also been driven, at least in part, by our increasing social links and construction of wide-ranging communities. This has concomitantly fostered the development of more sophisticated CNS networks, but at the same time a greater potential spread of pathogens. This later point of course, has been presumably met by increasing immunological defensive strategies, but also substantially complex potential disease possibilities. On top of microbial threats, the modern psychosocial world has opened the door to novel stressors, such as unmet social needs that can give rise to loneliness and sense alienation. The current pandemic would push the boundaries and exacerbate such conditions. Interestingly, a recent imaging study even went as far as demonstrating a unique loneliness-linked neural signature that included a series of brain regions known as the default network [124]. These higher associated brain regions together are critical for our sense of self and consciousness, but may also provide introspection on social events that are lacking and could ultimately, result in rumination and inner distress. Of course, this could have important implications for defining how pandemic-related loneliness and general psychosocial stress might prompt depressive and maladaptive or obsessive behavioral patterns.",
            "Modern immune-related sensing and appraisal systems would eventually also become linked with stress regulatory hormonal (HPA) and neurochemical (autonomic) systems, along with brain mechanisms for detecting threat and organizing social behaviors. Certainly, much work has demonstrated that the immune system, particularly through inflammatory cytokines, can markedly impact CNS stress circuitry, along with hormonal and neurochemical outcomes [29, 76]. Some brain regions impacted by cytokines include, the amygdala, which is critically involved in threat appraisal and the hippocampus, cingulate and prefrontal cortex [18, 65] that all have critical roles in shaping social behavior and developing highly plastic learning designed to maximize survival.",
            "Recent evidence is emerging to confirm a role for the immune system in the regulation of highly complex social processes. It makes intuitive sense that the immune system and brain would co-evolve as master regulators of organismic responses to external stimuli with a goal of maintaining internal homeostasis. It also stands to reason that these systems are so highly intertwined in a bi-directional manner in order to facilitate a dialogue aimed at optimally positioning the organism within the environment. With increasing interactions with conspecifics leading to highly complex social interactions among individuals, there also is an added likelihood of increased spread of pathogenic organisms [81]. This could help fuel the concomitant evolution of further specialized immune mechanisms to meet the progressive expansion of social links. Also, with increased sociability comes greater emotional attachments that aid in survival. However, increased emotionally opens the door to a range of new sensing problems, such as when attachments become compromised (as in the case of the isolation provoked by the current global pandemic) and psychosocial stress ensues and emotional pathology can result, such as the case with depression and anxiety-related disorders.",
            "The relatively newly evolved adaptive immune system may play a particularly germane role in both normal social functioning, as well as in cases of psychosocial stress. Indeed, T lymphocyte deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice were reported to have deficits in social preference and this deficit was reversed upon repopulation with wild-type lymphocytes [31]. It was further discovered that T lymphocytes found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secreted the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IFN-γ, and that his cytokine was most important for the organization of social behaviors. In fact, evidence from rodents, fruit flies and zebrafish all found that social conditions influenced IFN-γ-responsive genes, with an upregulation in the face of social interactions, but a reduction when social isolation occurred [31]. Further still, variations in adaptive immune cells were reported among wild mammals to be affected by social living conditions, as well as age and sex. For example, it was reported that variations in lymphocyte proportions (in males but not females) among wild European badgers was influenced by social group size and age, being smaller and declining faster with age in those animals living in relatively small groups, compared to those living in larger social groups [74].",
            "Other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, may also play a critical role in the regulation of complex social behaviors, through their ability to modify synaptic plasticity in hippocampal and cortical circuits. Indeed, TNF-α activates glutamatergic synaptic transmission by increasing presynaptic activity, postsynaptic AMPAR trafficking and synaptic insertion, while at the same time, suppressing inhibitory synaptic transmission [41, 125]. Further, TNF-α has been implicated in homeostatic (non-Hebbian) synaptic scaling, through its ability to regulate the quantity of synaptic AMPA receptors, as well as by synaptic pruning by controlling the phagocytosis capacity of microglia [47, 125]. Similarly, the multi-protein complex, called the inflammasome, that controls the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-18, is also thought to regulate synaptic pruning and play a role in neuronal survival [134]. It appears that IL-1β, in turn, modulates intracellular Ca2+ predominately through NMDA receptors in a dose-dependent manner. At physiological concentrations, IL-1β is able to increase Ca2+ influx and enhance Hebbian-based LTP, while pathophysiological levels of IL-1β decreased Ca2+ influx and impaired LTP [104, 109]. Ultimately, it seems that the pro-inflammatory cytokines may act as soluble mediators of neural plasticity and affect circuits that could be important for social processes.",
            "From an evolutionary perspective, pathogens, such as SARS-COV2, have long been competing and hence, co-evolving, with both immunological and CNS processes. Thus, immunological defences (both innate and adaptive) and brain defences (e.g., BBB) have evolved parallel sophisticated anti-pathogen strategies. At the same time, the pathogens themselves rather quickly (largely owing to their high genetic turnover rates) have evolved means of evading these defensive strategies. These strategies often revolve around the up- and down-regulation of specific receptors or increasing affinity for new targets, or the induction of some other structural changes [22, 58]. Other tricky strategies might include the release of soluble inhibitory factors or peptides with immunomodulatory properties [98]. Whatever the case, the eternal embrace for which the pathogen-detection systems are engaged in represent a remarkable endless biological struggle.",
            "Viral agents are first detected by innate immune cells bearing pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which detect distinct evolutionarily conserved structures on pathogens, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Among these, the toll-like receptors (TLRs), are particularly important and are expressed on CNS microglia regulating their detection of pathogenic threats [37, 52]. Intracellular viral RNA, including that of SARS-COV2, is generally detected by TLR3, whereas the spike proteins from the virus can be recognized by TLRs 1, 4 and 6 [17]. However, SARS-COV2 primarily enters and infects cells by first binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) membrane protein. Indeed, the spike protein of coronaviruses SARS-COV binds to ACE2 and facilitates its entry into cells. Hence, TLR-linked inflammatory signaling appears likely to occur only after ACE2 has been engaged by the virus, in an attempt to contain viral replication and spread. It has also been reported that other coronavirus proteins, such as ORF3a, can provoke NLRP3 inflammasome activity [49], which can further perpetuate neuroinflammatory cascades and accumulation of various peptides.",
            "To add further complexity to the mix, there is the possibility of “sterile inflammation” or the induction of an inflammatory cascade in the absence of a direct antigenic/pathogenic threat. Indeed, some of the same receptor systems that detect pathogen threats can also be trigger by non-immune danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) when cells are sufficiently distressed. In particular, in cases of tissue damage (such as stroke or head injury) DAMPs are released from damaged cells [40]. Chronic stressor exposure (in the form of electric shock and noise) in rodents likewise provoked the DAMP, HMGB1 and its receptor RAGE, and this effect was observed specifically in microglial cells [135]. This is yet another ingenious strategy, wherein non-pathogenic stressors are able to “detected or sensed” by a common defensive innate immune process. Hence, it is important to appreciate that during times of stress, these danger signals may further exacerbate any ongoing inflammatory responses, such as those provoked by infectious or other microbial challenges.",
            "It is generally thought that SARS-COV-2 invasion of the brain occurs either through a hematogenous (from peripheral immune cells) route or alternatively, possibly by migrating by way of an olfactory neural route [87, 93]. It is also likely that the virus itself can disrupt the BBB integrity, though its induction of systemic inflammation and that this can further augment neuroinvasion [112]. Since deficits in olfaction and taste are commonly reported during early stages of COVID19 [49], it was suggested that coronaviruses may be able to travel into the CNS through retrograde axonal transport via the cribriform plate [25]. Viral invasion of the CNS might also occur by way of retrograde synaptic transport via axons from receptors in the lung into the respiratory areas within the medulla of the brainstem [72] or of course, through circulatory or lymphatic routes [9, 75]. Once within the brain, SARS-COV2 infection may have neuroimmune effects either by, (a) direct entry into the intracellular compartment of neurons or glia, or by (b) inducing secondary damage from systemically or locally derived inflammatory cells or soluble factors.",
            "Some critical recent evidence questions whether the SARS-COV2 virus actually penetrates the brain parenchyma, but rather suggests that CNS effects might stem from the transmission of inflammatory signals from the choroid plexus at the level of the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier [132]. In fact, Yang et al. [132] found that gene expression profiles from the choroid plexus and medial prefrontal cortex of individuals that died from COVID19 failed to detect virus RNA or protein, but did reveal marked changes in numerous inflammatory genes.",
            "Studies from early in the COVID19 pandemic indicated that approximately 37% of severe cases that required hospitalization had neurological symptoms and these patients also had especially high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other innate inflammatory factors, including C-reactive protein (CRP) [69, 72, 80]. The most common symptoms reported were confusion, seizures, headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, gait deficits, cerebrovascular pathology and encephalitis [91]. Pathological peripheral symptomology also includes deficits in cranial nerve functioning that can give rise to compromised smell and taste, or the manifestation of elements of autoimmune disease, such as Guillain–Barré syndrome. Of course, the caveat must be mentioned that a great number of the more serious and hospitalized patients were also individuals of advanced age and this alone, is often associated with a greater inflammatory tone. In a sense, this might represent a sort of “perfect storm”, wherein the already existing potential age-dependent peripheral and central inflammatory state (along with any pre-existing disease) might interact with the viral hit resulting in exaggerated collateral damage within the CNS. This is consistent with the present theme of a multi-hit phenomenon promoting a disturbed neuroimmune phenotype.",
            "Diseases ranging from cancer to Parkinson’s to depression have been framed according to their link to multiple environmental insults over the course of one’s lifetime. In all these cases, it is likely the cumulative effects of differing environmental insults over time that eventually elicits illness. It could be envisioned as a tipping point being reached and the break point is likely determined by genetic vulnerabilities. The timing between these individual “hits” is probably just as important as how many and the severity of hits. Indeed, in the case of immune processes (and neural ones as well for that matter) the timing between hits is critical in shaping their impact. For instance, we and others have found that the time between exposure to differing immune insults, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, LPS, poly I:C, or between these insults and differing stressors (restraint, foot shock, chronic mild stress) or toxins (paraquat, MPTP) greatly influenced the nature of various outcomes observed, including motor behavior, sickness symptoms, stress hormonal levels, neurotransmitter turnover and even the degree of neurodegeneration evident [8, 38, 45, 59, 79, 105]. Thus, it is possible that time-locked neuro-immune-related sensitizing and/or synergistic processes are a fairly universal phenomenon, applicable to a range of environmental insults.",
            "If one views COVID19 as an environmental hit (and a very large one for many individuals) then it follows that many individuals may develop a long-term vulnerability to subsequent stressors or environmental insults. Further, when one considers the multi-system impact of the virus and associated stressor sequelae then the neuroimmune impact might be substantial. The cytokine storm that can occur in COVID19 is a particularly salient aspect of the disease that could reasonably be expected to elicit marked responses across many bodily systems. Indeed, the pro-inflammatory cytokines induced are extremely potent and require rapid buffering to restrain their potentially damaging consequences across multiple organ systems. If unchecked, these cytokines can cause tissue dysregulation and entrenched biological changes that can have enduring consequences. Within the CNS, these cytokines can affect neurogenesis, dendritic structural plasticity, mitochondrial functioning, synaptic neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity and overall cellular homeostasis. Prolonged excessive levels can be catastrophic for neurons and lead to hyper-active glial responses.",
            "Timing might be very important when considering the impact of immune factors in the context of coronaviral infection. It is already known that the kinetics of the antibody and T cell response following SARS-COV2 infection might be different among patients and vary as a function of disease severity [66, 90]. Also, the initial immune response to the viral infection is sometimes followed by a secondary hyper-active inflammatory response in many individuals, which can be especially toxic to organ functioning [86]. It is not yet clear whether responses of innate immune cells, such as macrophages or the brain’s microglia might also retain some sort of time-linked “memory” in response to the virus. We do know that these innate cells robustly respond to environmental toxins and some theories of CNS disease, suggest that they might become “locked” into a hyper-activated state over time, especially in vulnerable elderly individuals [43, 50].",
            "The concept of sensitization may be especially relevant when considering SARS-COV2 as a ‘hit’ that might have and enduring impact upon the brain. Indeed, as depicted in Fig. 1, age-dependent exposure to various environmental hits can lead to “inflammaging” and a priming of microglia, which may be further exacerbated by exposure to SARS-COV2. Such a primed microglial state might then engender further vulnerability and the likelihood of sickness responses emerging and even, over time, neurodegeneration. It is in fact well known that immunological events can sensitize subsequent biological responses. In fact, many allergies or autoimmune disorders can develop over time as a result of sensitization following exposure to various antigens in susceptible individuals. While these responses involve adaptive immune memory cells (T and B lymphocytes), there is also evidence that innate branches of immunity, involving macrophages and microglia, might also impart some degree of plasticity and “memory” for insults. Indeed, innate immune memory might take the form of either sensitization or tolerance, wherein enhanced or suppressed immune responses to a secondary insult are apparent. Such responses may be provoked by the same or differing insults upon subsequent exposures [19, 123, 94].Fig. 1Multiple environmental hits may prime microglia to modify responsiveness to SARS-COV2 and enhance the impact upon the central nervous system (CNS). Microglial cells can become “primed” as a result of advancing age and accumulated exposure to stressors, immune insults and potential environmental toxins. All of these insults have the ability to induce pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) and damage/danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMPs) that act upon microglia and potentially induce a state of inflammatory aging or “Inflammaging”. Subsequent exposure to the SARS-COV2 virus may then further stimulate microglia and favor an “activated” pro-inflammatory phenotype. The virus, acting through ACE2 proteins and TLR receptors, may either directly enter the CNS via olfactory nerves or indirectly act by stimulating peripheral targets in the lung, gastrointestinal or other organs. Infected CD8+ T lymphocytes appear able (albeit in a limited capacity) to enter the CNS or alternatively, soluble cytokines and other inflammatory and oxidative stress factors might secondarily impact the brain. Ultimately, such factors can interact with local microglia to orchestrate a neuroinflammatory milieu, which can impact neurons and favor sickness symptoms or in extreme situations (and with chronic activation) might contribute to neuronal pathology or conceivably, even neurodegeneration in the long run",

            "Paralleling the peripheral immune memory responses, central priming of microglial cells with immune challenges can lead to either an augmented (sensitized) or diminished (tolerance) responses to subsequent challenges. In the most severe immune sensitized cases, wherein systemic inflammation causes sepsis or septic shock sets in, unregulated inflammatory cytokine release and BBB breakdown occurs that can fuel microglial sensitivity. Such a situation involves a so-called “cytokine storm”, which is a term that does not really have a particularly clear definition but rather generally refers to a collection of pro-inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-β, that are released in abnormally high concentrations. If unchecked such peripheral inflammatory factors can adversely impact the brain. For example, in a mouse model of sepsis (cecal ligation and perforation) there was a shift in microglia to an amoeboid morphological profile with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines evident in the hippocampus [123]. These mice were also more susceptible to synapse damage in response to subtoxic amounts of b-amyloid, which stemmed from increased microglial phagocytic activity against hippocampal synapses [123].",
            "Much recent attention has been devoted to the fact that some COVID19 patients displayed evidence of such a cytokine storm, with elevations in IL-2, G-CSF, IL-7, TNF-α along with the chemokines, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A [121]. Likewise, a recent paper found IL-6 to be markedly elevated among SARS-COV2 infected patients and in fact, disease severity was correlated with circulating levels of this cytokine [42]. Yet, others report that the cytokine storm is likely not a major factor in widespread pathology in SARS-COV2 patients [120]. Nonetheless, excessive cytokine responses might have particularly dramatic consequences in the “long run” on elderly individuals that already have some degree of age-related inflammatory pathology or “inflamm-aging”. This may be one reason why elderly individuals are much more prone to the cytokine-mediated severe organ pathology. Indeed, the excessive inflamm-aging is already associated with elevated systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, as well as a reduction in anti-inflammatory mechanisms that normally keep such processes in check [85]. By the same token, inflammatory aging is also characterized by excessive reactive oxygen factors, reductions in protective autophagic processes, as well as alterations in ACE2 expression that impact viral spread [85]. Hence, all roads during aging may lead to the same increase in inflammatory cytokine-associated damage.",
            "With regard to the brain and especially relevant from a multi-hit perspective, a cross-sensitization between the immune system and brain might occur, wherein neuro-immune communication is disturbed. As an example, a single injection of the cytokines, IL-1β or TNF-α, provoked a sensitized neurochemical state, such that later exposure to these cytokines or to stressors evoked exaggerated behavioral, hormonal and central monoamine responses [44, 116]. But timing again is important here, TNF-α pre-treatment followed by re-exposure to the same cytokine 2–4 weeks later resulted in a very exaggerated HPA and behavioral sickness responses, however, changes in neurotransmission in cortical and extra-hypothalamic brain regions tended to be larger when re-exposure to the cytokine occurred after earlier intervals of 1–7 days [44]. Indeed, TNF-α re-exposure after longer intervals induced widespread illness reminiscent of systemic shock that was coupled with marked hypothalamic neurochemical alterations [3]. However, TNF-α re-exposure after briefly intervals (with presumably less time to sensitize adaptive immunity) prompted neurochemical changes within the prefrontal cortex in the absence of systemic illness [44, 45]. Such time-linked responses hint at the possibility that infectious events that markedly elevate cytokines might similarly be able to differentially modulate CNS processes, depending upon their temporal proximity to other environmental insults.",
            "Similar to their ability to time-dependently affect neural signaling, there is experimental evidence to suggest that immunological insults might also sensitize processes that can influence neurodegeneration. In this regard, pre-treatment of mice with either viral (poly I:C) or bacterial (LPS) agents time-dependently augmented the neurodegenerative response elicited by later toxin (the neurotoxic pesticide, paraquat) exposure [8, 80]. Importantly, the enhanced neurodegenerative response was associated with microglial priming, such that the impact of the second hit (paraquat) was augmented when it coincided with a time when microglia displayed an “activated” morphology. This occurred 2 (at peak microglial response) but not after 7 days following the initial LPS or poly I:C priming stimulus [8, 80].",
            "It remains to be determined what factors might control microglial priming, but it has been suggested that various cytokines or inflammatory factors could play a role and these might be particularly apparent in the degenerating or injured brain [102]. It also might be the case that augmented expression of Fc or other immune receptors might be up-regulated on primed microglia allowing their interactions with infiltrating adaptive immune cells or antibodies in the case of disease-related blood brain barrier breakdown [102]. There is also evidence that priming efficacy might be influenced by both developmental stage and dose of the eliciting stimulus. Indeed, when priming with very low doses of LPS, microglia derived from newborn rodents displayed enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS and augmented BNDF expression compared to those obtained from adult or aged murine brains [70]. In contrast, the administration of much higher doses of LPS resulted in a tolerance effect, wherein reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines, iNOS and BDNF was evident and this occurred regardless of the developmental state [70].",
            "Genetic analysis studies have begun to focus upon the collection of factors that might be responsible for the differing primed states of microglia. It was found that mice primed with a high LPS dose of LPS (10 mg/kg), displayed a very characteristic molecular profile that was enriched with genes critical for lysosomal and phagosome functioning, along with those associated with antigen presentation [94]. In particular, primed microglial genes included Axl, Apoe, Clec7a, Itgax, and Lgals3, which were referred to as a “disease-associated microglia (DAM) signature” [63]. At the same time, these same authors found many genes involved in homeostatic regulation were diminished with microglial priming, these included Cx3cr1, P2ry12 and Tmem119. Further studies have uncovered evidence of epigenetic mechanisms underlying microglial priming. In this regard, epigenetic silencing of the Il1b promoter in microglia was evident in mice following low-dose LPS (0.25 mg/kg) priming and this resulted in diminished CNS IL-1b levels in response to a second challenge with the endotoxin 32 weeks later [114]. Hence, epigenetic reprogramming might play a role in shaping a specific DAM “signature” that has long-term consequences on microglial reactivity and it is conceivable that such microglial signature priming might also occur in the context of SARS-COV2 or other infectious agents.",
            "The process of aging alone over one’s lifetime may result in a gradual shift towards a primed neuroinflammatory microglial state. Curiously, this somewhat differs from the peripheral immune counterpart, the macrophage, which tends to display age-accumulated senescence and diminished inflammatory responses [107]. In this regard, microbial (e.g., LPS) or traumatic (e.g., surgery) insults were reported to provoke blunted peripheral macrophage-driven inflammatory responses in aged rodents [6]. Intriguingly however, the opposite effect was observed within the CNS, wherein enhanced microglial-driven neuroinflammatory responses were observed in aged mice [39, 54]. Hence, divergent innate inflammatory responses may occur in the CNS vs periphery in aged animals. Although the reason behind this is unclear, it is conceivable that the delicate CNS tissue may require more robust defensive responses against microbial threats and the overall microbial/toxin load that might accumulate in the body over long periods of time. Finally, the density and reactivity of microglia appears to vary between differing brain regions, being influenced by varied CNS microenvironments. Accordingly, age-dependent variations in microglial state are not uniform across brain regions, just as the case that age-dependent neuronal damage/degeneration is very much CNS location specific.",
            "The aging process, together with an individual’s immune/stressor history may promote low-grade inflammation and an “inflammaging” phenotype [19]. Such a persisting inflammatory background has been posited to be able to prime individuals to the development of various age-related diseases, as well as sensitize them to the impact of subsequent infectious agents (Fig. 1) [96]. Intriguingly, it was posited that innate inflammation that has beneficial consequences earlier in life, might switch to being detrimental with advanced age (possibly owing to the diminished evolutionary pressure presumed at advanced ages) [33]. Of course, not only microbial factors, but trauma or tissue damage that sometimes occurs with the aging process, such as with serious reductions in cerebral blood flow may promote inflammatory priming. Ischemic stroke did induce marked cytokine changes and increase protein levels of ACE2 in the lungs (and presumably aid viral infiltration), which correlated with the severity of behavioral deficits that occurred [119]. Ultimately, it be may be that a “pro-inflammatory threshold” exists that when exceeded gives rise to age-related illnesses, such as various cancers and neurodegenerative disease [33].",
            "There is the question as to whether individuals already with existing CNS disorders might be especially vulnerable to COVID19 and if they do develop the disease, would this impact their primary disease state. For instance, might COVID19 increase psychiatric or neurological symptoms in individuals already suffering from depression, anxiety, Alzheimer’s or  Parkinson’s disease (PD)? It is already known that there are a higher proportion of hospitalized COVID19 patients that also have a neurodegenerative disease and that these individuals have a particularly high mortality rate [30, 88]. Yet, it is unclear as to whether the infection affects the trajectory of the underlying neurodegenerative disease, as this would require future longitudinal studies among survivors. Similarly, while it is safe to say that the stress associated with COVID19 might precipitate depressive or anxious pathology, it will be of interest to determine whether the immune sequelae per se induced by the virus can do the same. Since neuro-immune links are inherently bi-directional, the cytokines or other factors at play in COVID19 could certainly be expected to disturb this delicate communication and potentially dysregulate both peripheral and CNS elements of disease.",
            "The multi-hit hypothesis has received particular attention regarding the origins of neurodegenerative diseases, most notably PD, wherein the majority of cases are idiopathic and believed to involve some degree of environmental triggers. Further still, the idea of multiple microbes interacting may acts as “hits” to exert some degree cumulative damage might contribute to PD development [28]. Indeed, one study found that PD patients were more likely to have been infected with multiple pathogens, compared to age-matched controls and these pathogens included Helicobacter pylori, Epstein Barr virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and herpes simplex virus [13]. Further evidence for a multi-hit idea comes from the general finding of a lack of robust pathological phenotype in rodents expressing various PD implicated genes. Rather an additional factor, such as an immunological insult is required to provoke behavioral and functional pathology reminiscent clinical disease [95]. For instance, mice bearing the common PD-linked mutation, G2019S LRRK2, had exacerbated dopamine neuron loss and motor impairment following exposure to the toxicant, MPTP, compared to those expressing the wild-type LRRK2 gene [4, 60]. Similarly, treatment of G2019S LRRK2 mice with a single dose of the common experimental endotoxin, LPS, provoked exaggerated neuroinflammatory changes in the cortex and ventral brain regions with PET imaging of [11C] PBR28, compared to non-transgenic mice [115]. Other studies likewise revealed increased inflammatory (but not neurodegenerative) outcomes in G2019S LRRK2 mutants treated with LPS together with the toxicant, paraquat [26].",
            "Similar to PD, some evidence points to the possibility that multiple toxins and genetic mutations might collectively contribute to late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), whereas in contrast, the early onset form of disease appears to be largely determined by single gene variants [111]. In effect, it was postulated that LOAD may occur slowly over time resulting from progressive homeostatic imbalances that stem from inefficient energy metabolism. Such shifts in energy homeostasis would leave individuals with an inability to compensate for the impact of accumulating environmental insults [111]. Similarly, it has been suggested that the build-up of soluble Aβ oligomers might act as an initial step [35], that can render individuals vulnerable to subsequent insults that conceivably, occur in the context of slowly unfolding time-dependent genetic programs.",
            "Just as is the case for other neurodegenerative disorders, there is reason to believe that microglial priming might occur with aging and repeated environmental hits and potentially lead to the development of LOAD. It was indeed posited that infectious or other hits during critical brain periods lead to microglial “priming”, which could contribute to the development of disease [51]. Furthermore, acute and chronic LPS administration differentially influenced various outcomes in APP23 Alzheimer’s transgenic mice. For instance, at 6 months following an individual acute LPS injection in APP23 mice, there were diminished anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels and increased Aβ plaque accumulation [130]; whereas, a more chronic LPS schedule produced an opposing outcome with a reduction of pro-inflammatory IL-1b levels, coupled with decreased plaque load [130]. Whatever the case, it remains to be determined whether or not SARS-COV2 exposure might act as an important “hit” that primes microglial (either towards a sensitized or tolerant phenotype) and if so, what are the long-term implications with regard to CNS disease outcomes.",
            "In addition to neurodegeneration, SARS-COV2 may provoke neuropsychiatric illnesses, either alone or as a co-morbid feature of another disease. One study that assessed over 400 COVID-19 survivors found evidence for various psychiatric symptoms [83]. In this regard, around 30% of patients self-reported signs of depression and about 40% complained of excessive anxiety and insomnia. Collectively, 56% these individuals scored in the pathological range and these scores correlated with measures of systemic inflammation (lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts [83]). Another recent article has even advocated for the repurposing of tetracycline drugs, that can inhibit microglial reactivity and neuroinflammation, for treating COVID19-related depressive illness [15]. Indeed, there has been a plethora of research implicating inflammatory processes in general and microglia in particular, in the genesis of clinical depression [128, 133]. Hence, it has been suggested COVID-19 survivors be periodically assessed with regard to potential inflammatory biomarkers that might foster the emergence of psychiatric symptoms [83].",
            "Time will tell what possible long-term consequences of SARS-COV2 upon the brain will emerge. In the case of the 1918 influenza pandemic, we know that a sizable number of survivors developed acute encephalitis, and some went on to develop clear neurological syndromes, involving motor or cognitive deficits [32, 126]. While it might only be a small number of COVID19 individuals that suffer actual neuronal damage, there may be a sizable number that face “low grade” inflammatory processes that contribute vulnerability and may affect healthy “brain ageing”. Of course, another factor is the stress of the social isolation and constant fear over one’s health that undoubtedly is taking a toll in large populations throughout the world. The rate of psychiatric illness is already on the rise and will likely continue to do so. For many, COVID19 might be the “last straw” or give rise to conditions that act as a tipping point for mental illness.",
            "Aging has emerged as a huge key risk factor for the pathological impact of SARS-COV2, with mortality influenced by age above virtually all other factors. It remains to be determined how age will modulate long-term brain functioning in the face of COVID19 disease, but we do certainly know that microglia in the aged brain are more likely to produce exaggerated or at least somewhat abnormal neuroinflammatory cascades in response to subsequent challenges. As mentioned earlier, the excessive inflammatory aging (Inflamm-Aging) that is often present in many elderly individuals could result in a subgroup of COVID patients (ones that survive the acute effects of the infection) developing further CNS complications and possible earlier death in the years following the infection.",
            "Post-mortem assessment of the brains of patients that died from COVID19 have revealed several abnormalities, consistent with neuropathology. These include edema, neuronal loss, necrosis, glial hyperplasia and signs of ischemia and demyelination [62, 99, 118]. In particular, collateral damage has been reported such as ischemic strokes, stemming from cerebrovascular abnormalities produced by the viral spread and subsequent inflammatory stress upon the cardiovascular system [48, 89]. Many such neuropathological features have been, more or less, recapitulated in mice inoculated with various coronaviruses. For instance, infection with the coronavirus, hCoV-OC43, produced spongiform-like degeneration in mice, along with impaired motor activity and poor limb clasping [56, 55]. Alarmingly, behavioral effects were evident months following viral infection and neuronal degeneration within the hippocampus was detected after one full year. The authors found that even following clearance of the virus, its viral RNA still persisted for several months. It was also speculated that following recovery from the prominent clinical symptoms, there still may be a low level of persisting virus present. In a sense, a low-grade or latent infection could conceivably persist and exert cumulative long-term effects. It could also potentially interact with other microbial threats or environmental stressors yielding additive or synergistic outcomes on a variety of neural or glial systems. We have previously found that cytokine induced synergistic effects are in fact, frequently observed with regard to neurotransmission, as well as stress hormonal and behavioral changes following combined exposure to LPS, poly I:C and stressors [11, 36].",
            "Encephalopathy has been reported in a number of SARS-CoV-2-infected cases and is often in association with delirium, agitation or motor disturbances. These clinical symptoms are generally found in the context of increased peripheral inflammatory factors, but surprisingly, typically normal levels were apparent within the CSF [48]. Similarly, there was a notable absence of SARS-COV2 viral fragments detected in CSF from severe neurological cases, even in those showing EEG abnormalities [23, 48]. Yet, other emerging findings indicate that SARS-COV2 does have some affinity for the brain and this is particularly evident in severe cases. One such study reported that about 36% of patients with severe COVID infections (hospitalized in Wuhan) had neurological symptoms [80] and an even more striking parallel study reported this number to be as high as 90% in cases in a hospital in France [48]. A similarly conducted German study found SARS-COV2 RNA in 53% of the brains of fatal COVID-19 cases [82].",
            "A couple of recent intriguing studies, using human brain organoids, presented evidence that SARS-COV2 viral particles could infect and replicate within neurons, eventually potentially inducing neuronal death [101, 106, 135]. Yet this neuronal death did not co-localize directly with virus infection, but there were metabolic changes in the infected cells. Hence, it was posited that the infected cells might provoke disturbances that favor hypoxic or other injury to neighboring cells [122]. Further, the fact that anti-viral antibodies were also recently reported in the CSF of a neurologically ill COVID-19 patient [129], raises the possibility that the adaptive immune response to the virus might penetrate the brain to modify neurological status.",
            "Ongoing studies are confirming that ACE2 is likely expressed in both CNS neurons and glial cells [16]. Intriguingly, ACE2 levels appear to be brain-region specific being particularly high in the olfactory bulb and in pericytes associated with the BBB, but also were detected in the hippocampus, substantia nigra, middle temporal gyrus, and posterior cingulate cortex [16]. Another intriguing recent study using post-mortem human tissue found ACE2 expression throughout the brain, with the amygdala, cerebral cortex and brainstem showing the most robust expression [77]. Hence, it appears likely that the SARS-COV2 virus has the capacity to infiltrate the brain and have the capacity to act directly to cause neuropathology under some circumstances.",
            "With regard to microglia, recent post-mortem tissue from those that died from COVID19 provide evidence to suggest that at least some brain microglia are in an “activated” phenotype and that they co-exist with infiltrating CD8+ T cytotoxic cells (particularly in the medulla brain region) [82]. It was further suggested that brain microglia likely play a role in stimulating the invading CD8+ T cells, thereby priming these peripherally derived cells within the CNS. This would suggest localized brain immunity and antigen presentation can occur. Interestingly, there were not really any signs that frank neurodegeneration was occurring in these patients, suggesting that, at least in the short run, any CNS primed cells did not show a proclivity towards neurotoxicity. This is not to say that neuronal health was not affected and that over time, there may eventually be some degree of neuronal pathology or degeneration.",
            "Although a small number of SARS-COV2 viral particles were localized in the brain [82], these might have come about through infection or alternatively, stem from BBB weakening as a result of the severity of disease. Yet, it is interesting that the microglia and CD8+ T cell findings were very consistent and did not vary as a function of the patient co-morbidities (all had some of co-morbid disease, most notably cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, or cancers) or rapidity of disease spread. Overall, it seems that the brain is not an immediate SARS-COV2 target in terms of gross neural pathology and that it will take some time before we know the actual long-term consequences of the virus.",
            "Even in the absence of actual viral penetration into the brain, there are emerging data suggesting that peripheral immune cells and soluble factors might enter the CNS. For instance, a just released comprehensive post-mortem study has provided more compelling evidence of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and microglial activation following severe COVID19 disease [117]. In this study, COVID19 patients had significant CD8+ T cell infiltration, together with signs of activated CD68 and the TMEM119 expressing microglia, compared to controls and those that died from non-COVID19-related respiratory illness. Overall, 80% of COVID19 patients had increased levels of either diffuse or dense clusters (microglial nodes) of microglia, 68% displayed detectable CD8+ T cell infiltration into the parenchyma and 36%–44% had the most severe phenotype, which was associated with some degree of axonal damage (but no signs of necrotic cell death) in the medulla [117].",
            "Finally, immune T cell infiltration and microglial activation appears to vary between anatomical regions. Indeed, the infiltration by T lymphocytes and activation of microglia was particularly evident within most the brainstem and cerebellum, and fresh ischemic lesions were also observed in a subset of these patients [82]. A further post-mortem study by Poloni et al. [103] detected prominent CD68-positive microglia that were again, most apparent in the brainstem of COVID-19 cases (this was in contrast to the higher microglia levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of a comparison group of Alzheimer’s patients). It was also observed that sparse pockets of T lymphocytes appeared to infiltrate the CNS, wherein they tended to cluster around microglial-rich regions. Yet, the fact that there was little presence of the actual SARS-COV2 virus within the brain [103], suggests that the virus does not have to actually breach CNS barriers in order to exert central immunity and influence delicate neural circuitry. Taken together, the emerging evidence seems to suggest that post-COVID-19 brains are characterized by a prominent innate microglial response, with some signs of T lymphocyte-driven adaptive immunity, but more subtle changes in neuronal integrity and no obvious signs of encephalitis or frank neurodegeneration. Although, it should be considered that there is a possibility that the virus might exacerbate or sensitize neurons to the acute effects of cerebral stroke, given the increase in ischemic lesions in COVID19 patients [82]. According to a “multi-hit” framework, with the passage of time and increasing age (and further environmental hits) there may emerge neuronal damage/degeneration in post-COVID-19 patients, but only further longitudinal studies will determine what future outcomes will resemble.",
            "The rapidly emerging data indicate that SARS-COV2 provokes a highly complex range of symptoms that can impact multiple systems, including the CNS. While the profile of individuals that develop serious disease is heterogenous, it is absolutely clear that advanced age is a predominate risk factor. It also seems evident that age-related changes in immunity and inflammatory processes in particular, are critically linked to disease severity. Of course, a number of individuals will ultimately succumb to the disease, but among the survivors, it is posited that there may be various sub-groups that go on to develop neurological illness as a result of the viral exposure acting in concert with any other environmental stressors. It is possible that the acute very marked upregulation of cytokines (so-called cytokine storm) that follows serious pulmonary respiratory disease might have long-term sensitizing effects that could lead to further disease. Likewise, it is also possible that chronic low-grade inflammation might persist following resolution of the viral infection and this could subsequently interact with further stressors to spur disease. Of course, beyond the biological impact of the actual viral infection, the concomitant psychological distress in the form of worry, loneliness, sense of helplessness and loss of social supports should also be considered. Such psychogenic stressors can have potent effects that would act as a further “hit’ in the context of our multi-hit model. Whatever the case, longitudinal studies will be required to address such questions.",
            "The development of novel immunotherapeutics to combat viral infection must critically be evaluated, so as to not adversely interact with neuroimmune elements. For instance, it would be important to take steps to avoid antibody-dependent toxicity. In this case, IgG antibodies that bind to viral antigens (e.g., spike glycoprotein S1), could conceivably, induce neuroinflammation through their infiltration into the host immune cells via their Fc receptors. In fact, there has been at least one observation of a paradoxical rise in disease severity in the presence of viral-directed antibody titers [14]. Yet, there is scant evidence to support a direct role for S1-IgG triggered activation of the complement system and subsequent pathology. But the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 was shown to stimulate the complement system, resulting in elevated C3 and C5a complement proteins in the lungs and serum [57]. It was further suggested that activated complement elements can damage sensitive CNS cells, following their activation either peripherally or within the confines of cerebroventricular system [78].",
            "Research inspired by the COVID19 pandemic will undoubtedly open new doors to better understanding micro-processes of cellular immunity and emerging viruses, all the way up to macro-processes of globalization and health care delivery. The heterogeneity of COVID19 symptoms, including those involving the CNS, has reinforced the connectedness to the brain and immune system and underscored the importance of considering the delicate orchestration between such systems. Perhaps above all else, we have learned that science-driven global cooperation across research and medical issues is critical for preventing further catastrophes.",

            "SARS-CoV-2, which causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has a brain neurotropism through binding to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressed by neurones and glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia. Systemic infection which accompanies severe cases of COVID-19 also triggers substantial increase in circulating levels of chemokines and interleukins that compromise the blood-brain barrier, enter the brain parenchyma and affect its defensive systems, astrocytes and microglia. Brain areas devoid of a blood-brain barrier such as the circumventricular organs are particularly vulnerable to circulating inflammatory mediators. The performance of astrocytes and microglia, as well as of immune cells required for brain health, is considered critical in defining the neurological damage and neurological outcome of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2, the implication of neuroinflammation, adaptive and innate immunity, autoimmunity, as well as astrocytic and microglial immune and homeostatic functions in the neurological and psychiatric aspects of COVID-19. The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection during ageing, in the presence of systemic comorbidities, and for the exposed pregnant mother and foetus are also covered.",
            "Invasion of the SARS-CoV-2 into the lung is the first, and the most frequent, step in COVID-19. Yet the virus, and the immune responses against it, can spread into the other organs including the central nervous system (CNS) and cause severe neurological outcomes during the disease development and progression, especially for patients with comorbidities and/or elderly people (Huang et al., 2020; Wolfel et al., 2020; Wu and McGoogan, 2020).",
            "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the second major virus outbreak that engulfs the world threatening mankind and disrupting the canvas of civilisation. Rather ominously, the first one was a Spanish flu caused by influenza A virus subtype H1N1 that started in the summer of 1918; the influenza pandemic added to the global world catastrophe instigated by the Great War and claimed ~50 million people, being thus two times deadlier than the mass killing on the battlefield (Morens and Fauci, 2007). The clinical presentation of Spanish flu included neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms, both acute and delayed; the H1N1 virus was arguably linked to the still mysterious encephalitis lethargica, which alone claimed 500,000 death in 1920s (Crookshank, 1919; Ravenholt and Foege, 1982). Similarly, the clinical presentation of COVID-19 frequently includes neurological symptoms and neuropathologies such as acute ischemic stroke, meningitis/encephalitis, acute necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, acute Guillain–Barré syndrome (Beyrouti et al., 2020; Dixon et al., 2020; Oxley et al., 2020; Paterson et al., 2020; Pero et al., 2020; Poyiadji et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) as well as psychiatric manifestations such as depression, delirium, and psychosis (Steardo et al., 2020b). The retrospective analysis revealed that up to 20–30% of patients with severe forms of COVID-19 presented signs of disrupted consciousness and altered mental status (Chen et al., 2020; Varatharaj et al., 2020).",
            "In this review, we discuss the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2, the implication of neuroinflammation, adaptive and innate immunity, autoimmunity, as well as glial cells (mainly astrocytes and microglia) in the neurological and psychiatric aspects of COVID-19. The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection during ageing, in presence of comorbidities, and for the exposed pregnant mother and foetus will be specifically covered. We will also highlight promising research avenues to pursue regarding the involvement of glial cells in COVID-19 neuropathobiology.",
            "How SARS-CoV-2 damages the CNS? First and foremost, the virus can directly infect neural cells (Song et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the group 2B of β-coronavirus family, several members of which demonstrate neurotropism (Lau et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2005; Steardo et al., 2020a; Zhou et al., 2020). There are several routes for coronaviruses entry to the CNS. The most studied pathway for infection involves binding to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which together with other components of angiotensin system is expressed in the CNS, mostly by endothelial cells (Zeisel et al., 2015) but also by both neurons and neuroglial cells (Xia and Lazartigues, 2010; Gowrisankar and Clark, 2016; Tekin et al., 2018; Nemoto et al., 2020). Like a key inserted into a lock, ACE2 permits SARS-CoV-2 to invade cells using the spike-like proteins located on their surface. The actual invasion occurs through endocytosis controlled by endosomal proton pump, and by NAADP-sensitive intracellular two-pore channel 2 (TPC2) (Petersen et al., 2020) (Figure 1). The ACE2 is particularly concentrated in the brain stem, among the regions associated with regulation of cardiovascular and respiratory systems. In particular, ACE2 populates the circumventricular organs (CVOs), the subfornical organ, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS), and rostral ventrolateral medulla (Xia and Lazartigues, 2010; Gowrisankar and Clark, 2016). All these structures are highly vascularised and they lack the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) (Duvernoy and Risold, 2007), which is formed by the endothelial cells lining brain vessels, together with pericytes, astrocytes, microglia, and extracellular components such as the basement membrane that together form the neurovascular unit (Abbott et al., 2006; Grotta et al., 2008; del Zoppo, 2009; Iadecola, 2017). Absence of the BBB, crucial for the constant monitoring of peripheral health status, makes CVOs more vulnerable to peripheral neurotoxic molecules or invasive agents. Coronaviruses may also infect CNS structures following intranasal administration; possibly with the trans-synaptic route being the main culprit (Netland et al., 2008; Li et al., 2016). Trans-nasal and trans-synaptic invasion in particular seem to deliver the viral particles into the olfactory bulb and then into the brain stem, possibly compromising the respiratory centres (Li et al., 2016). Post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis in COVID-19 patients demonstrated an asymmetry in olfactory bulb and aberrant brain parenchyma in 21% of samples thus further corroborating the relevance of trans-nasal CNS infection (Coolen et al., 2020).",
            "Scheme illustration of the neurotropism, neuroinflammatory processes, and effects on brain cells triggered by COVID-19 in patients. (A) Immune cells from the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS) produce effector molecules that include pro-inflammatory cytokines and autoantibodies. (B) SARS-CoV-2 infection also causes leakage of the blood-brain barrier leading in some cases to haemorrhage and cerebral infarct, as well as eliciting leukocytes infiltration. (C) In the parenchyma, the CNS cells become infected by SARS-CoV via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) endocytosis mediated by the two-pore channel 2 (TCP2). (D) SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to loss of physiological functions of the brain cells, including neurones, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. Cell types are identified in the following manner; A, Astrocyte; L, Leukocyte; M, Microglia; N, Neurone; O, Oligodendrocyte.",
            "Besides direct invasion of neural cells, SARS-CoV-2 virus affects the neurovascular unit and CNS through systemic inflammation. The major feature of the systemic infection in COVID-19 is the massive increase of pro-inflammatory factors in the circulating blood, often described as a “cytokine storm” (Coperchini et al., 2020) (Figure 1). Although the BBB segregates the CNS from the systemic circulation, this segregation is not absolute. The brain and spinal cord constantly communicate with the body's immune system; systemic inflammation, when developed, inevitably influences the CNS (Schwartz and Deczkowska, 2016). Both innate and adaptive immune responses can affect the CNS, through their cellular elements and circulating pro-inflammatory factors. For example, effectors T- and B-lymphocytes enter the CNS (even when the BBB stays intact) aiming at invasive pathogens (Hickey et al., 1991; Carson et al., 2006). Leucocytes enter the CNS through the choroid plexus and disseminate through the perivascular space (Wilson et al., 2010). Systemic infection which accompanies severe cases of COVID-19 was shown to proceed with substantial increase in circulating levels of chemokines and interleukins, which compromise the BBB and enter the CNS where they encounter the defensive systems represented by astrocytes and microglia. Performance of these immune and glial cells is critical in defining the neurological damage and neurological outcome of the COVID-19.",
            "Astrocytes and microglia are highly heterogeneous cell populations. They are, respectively, neural cells of ectodermic origin and innate immune cells of mesodermal origin, which together represent key elements of the CNS homoeostatic system (Figure 2). Astrocytes and microglia sustain homeostasis ranging from the molecular to the whole organic levels, including via transport of ions, uptake of neurotransmitters, scavenging of reactive oxygen species (molecular level), regulation of neurogenesis, synapse formation, maintenance and elimination (cellular and network levels), regulation of blood flow, glycogen synthesis and storage (metabolic level), as well as control of the BBB and glymphatic clearance (whole brain level) (Hanisch and Kettenmann, 2007; Tay et al., 2017b, 2019; Verkhratsky et al., 2015b, 2016, 2020; Verkhratsky and Nedergaard, 2018; Mestre et al., 2020; Mondo et al., 2020). Astrocytes further contribute to the regulation of energy balance and food intake, blood pH and Na+ concentration, as well as of sleep homeostat (Verkhratsky and Nedergaard, 2018).",
            "Physiological functions of astrocytes and microglia are altered with age, which may render the brain vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 detrimental effects. (Upper panel) Under adult homoeostatic conditions, astrocytes notably contribute to the regulation of neuronal activity and neurovascular function (e.g., blood flow and permeability), while microglia participate to myelination, synaptic plasticity, and clearance processes. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, these physiological roles are altered, potentially contributing to the COVID-19 associated cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. (Lower panel) In aged brain, dystrophic astrocytes and microglia decrease their efficient contribution to brain homeostasis due to impaired physiological functions. These dysfunctions of glial cells promote neurodegenerative processes, potentially leading to worsened cognitive decline upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "An important homeostatic task of astroglia is the formation of barriers protecting the brain from the peripheral influences; in essence astrocytes form the nervous tissue that constitutes the BBB. This parenchymal wall is represented by the glia limitans externa (bordering the pia matter) and glia limitans perivascularis (plastering the intra-parenchymal blood vessels), which are formed by astroglial endfeet (Mathiisen et al., 2010; Quintana, 2017). Astroglial barriers, together with other elements of the BBB, are critical in fencing the brain against both toxic and infectious invasions. Furthermore, astrocytes regulate the permeability of BBB through influencing expression of tight junctions in endothelial cells layer (Kriauciunaite et al., 2020). Serum levels of the astrocytic calcium binding protein S100b, associated with an increased BBB permeability, significantly correlate with COVID-19 disease severity, inflammation markers (ferritin, C-Reactive Protein, procalcitonin), and organ damage markers (alanine aminotransferase, creatinine) (Aceti et al., 2020). S100b is a calcium binding protein, strongly expressed in astrocytic endfeet lining the BBB; genetic deletion of S100b is associated with age-dependent increase in BBB leakage (Wu et al., 2016). Another astrocytic protein that could be affected in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection is aquaporin-4, also expressed by astrocytic endfeet lining the BBB, and critically involved in the exchange of fluids between the CNS and the vasculature (Nagelhus and Ottersen, 2013).",
            "Juxtavascular microglia contribute to the glia limitans with their ramified processes ensheathing the basement membrane, especially in areas devoid of astrocytic endfeet (Bisht et al., 2016; Joost et al., 2019). While microglia are associated with the regulation of vascular remodelling, blood flow and BBB maintenance, the molecular mechanisms underlying these emerging functions are largely undetermined (Zhao et al., 2018; Halder and Milner, 2019; Haruwaka et al., 2019). Among the microglial subtypes that could be involved, “dark microglia,” which are defined ultrastructurally by their cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic condensation, giving them a dark appearance, were shown to tightly interact with blood vessels. These cells are rare in healthy young adults, but highly prevalent upon maternal immune activation [MIA; notably induced with the viral mimic polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)], chronic stress, ageing, and in various disease states. While dark microglia's consequences on the BBB are still elusive, they make extensive phagocytic interactions with synapses, suggesting their implication in pathological remodelling of neuronal circuits (Bisht et al., 2016; St.-Pierre et al., 2020).",
            "Studies performed in the last decade demonstrated numerous physiological functions of microglia during brain maturation, activity and plasticity throughout life (Tay et al., 2017b, 2019). In critical developmental periods, microglia participate to the brain maturation by regulating glio- and neuronogenesis, synapse formation, maturation and function, by clearing the brain from extracellular debris and by refining its synaptic connections, notably through their phagocytic activity and release of trophic factors, as well as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (Kettenmann et al., 2013; Tay et al., 2017b). Once neuronal circuits are formed, mature microglia play important roles in neuronal circuit remodelling, learning, memory and the adaptation of the brain and behaviour to lifestyle factors including the diet, physical activity, sleep patterns, and other external influences (Garofalo et al., 2020; Madore et al., 2020). More recently, microglia were also found to contribute to developmental myelination and remyelination (for instance in multiple sclerosis) through the release of trophic factors regulating oligodendrocyte progenitor's formation and maturation, as well as removal of myelin debris required for remyelination (Domingues et al., 2016; Hughes and Appel, 2020; Traiffort et al., 2020).",
            "While the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 on cells of the oligodendrocytic lineage responsible for myelination remain unclear, COVID-19 resulted in several cases of demyelinating Guillain-Barré syndrome (Arnaud et al., 2020; Padroni et al., 2020; Sedaghat and Karimi, 2020; Tiet and AlShaikh, 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) and Miller-Fisher syndrome (Gutierrez-Ortiz et al., 2020). Similarly, other recent viral outbreaks were associated with increased cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome and other demyelinating conditions (Beghi et al., 2020). Studies using other coronaviruses, such as herpes virus, revealed that cells of the oligodendrocytic lineage can be infected, yet they survived and contributed to sustaining neuroinflammation (Pan et al., 2020). These effects could be exerted in concert with microglia and astrocytes, as well as regulated by the exposure to peripheral stimuli and other external influences. Astrocytes regulate the activity and reactivity of microglia, and vice versa, microglia can regulate the activity and reactivity of astrocytes, also with consequences on cells of the oligodendrocytic lineage. Glial cells are thus orchestrating together the brain health and its response to systemic and local pathology (Pascual et al., 2012; Rothhammer et al., 2018; Jay et al., 2019; Vainchtein and Molofsky, 2020).",
            "In systemic infection such as evoked by SARS-CoV-2, the BBB can undergo disruptive or non-disruptive remodelling, so classified based on morphological alterations. The non-disruptive BBB develops through molecular and cellular mechanisms that compromise permeability of the barrier (Varatharaj and Galea, 2017). Disruptive BBB pathology proceeds with anatomical changes, such as loss of tight junctions integrity, increased vesicular transport, re-appearance of fenestrae, degradation of glycocalyx, apoptotic death of endothelial cells, breakdown of glia limitans and astrocytic damage (Minami et al., 1998; Candelario-Jalil et al., 2007; Varatharaj and Galea, 2017). The disruption of the BBB, which is exacerbated by stress, sleep deprivation, metabolic syndrome, vascular comorbidities, as well as ageing, for instance (Małkiewicz et al., 2019), allows CNS entrance of pathological agents, including viral particles among other damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Infiltration of DAMPs triggers astroglial reactivity, disruption of endfeet and astroglial death thus creating a vicious circle further damaging the BBB (Biesmans et al., 2013; Cardoso et al., 2015). Similarly, microglia respond to BBB disruption and DAMPs presence by increasing their phagocytic capacity and release of pro-inflammatory mediators, together associated with their reactivity (Fleshner and Crane, 2017). The type of BBB pathology depends on the severity of the systemic inflammation and, in case of severe COVID-19 pathology, disruptive compromise of BBB is highly likely.",
            "Apart from keeping the barrier tight, astrocytes contribute to the brain defence by mounting reactive astrogliosis, which is an evolutionary conserved programme of astrocytic remodelling in response to pathological lesions. Activation of astrogliotic programme instigates changes in gene expression, in astrocytic biochemistry, morphology and physiology with an ultimate goal of protecting the CNS against pathological lesion (Sofroniew, 2014, 2015; Pekny et al., 2016; Verkhratsky et al., 2017). Astrogliotic programme is flexible and is disease-specific; numerous investigations demonstrating remarkable diversity of reactive astrocytic phenotypes, incompatible with the much popularised A1/A2 dichotomy (Grubman et al., 2019; Henrik Heiland et al., 2019; Al-Dalahmah et al., 2020; Wheeler et al., 2020). Similarly, the M1/M2 activated microglia nomenclature has been rejected (Ransohoff, 2016). Reactive astrocytes are considered to be essential elements of neuroprotection in infectious diseases: ablation of astrogliosis was shown to exacerbate the brain infection. For example, suppression of astrogliosis in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) knockout mice substantially facilitates the penetration of Staphylococcus aureus or Toxoplasma gondii into the brain, which results in vasculitis, purulent ventriculitis and severe brain oedema (Stenzel et al., 2004).",
            "Post-mortem MRI examinations of the brains of patients who died from COVID-19 revealed multiple subcortical haemorrhages (Coolen et al., 2020), which most likely instigated glial reactivity. There are indications for reactive astrogliosis in COVID-19. For example, plasma concentration of the astrogliosis marker GFAP in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 is significantly increased (Kanberg et al., 2020). The generalised increase in GFAP expression was found in the white matter of a COVID-19 victim with disseminated encephalomyelitis (Reichard et al., 2020). In experimental mouse models of infection with coronavirus, MHV-59A resulted in encephalitis with prominent astrogliosis and induction of astroglial synthesis of cytokines; moreover, neurovirulence correlated with the cytokine response (Li et al., 2004). At the same time, viral infections may damage astrocytes: for example, a severe astrodegeneration in the form of clasmatodendrosis, an astrocytic morphological change characterised by fragmentation of the distal processes and swollen cell bodies, has been identified in the brains of influenza-associated encephalopathy victims (Tachibana et al., 2019). Overall, it is important to analyse how different subtypes of astrocytes and their diverse responses contribute over time to the neurological and psychiatric effects of COVID-19. Determining in animal models the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in disruptive BBB pathology, astrogliosis promoting neuroprotection upon brain infection, as well as cytokine response and degeneration, in concert with microglial functions, is critical at this stage of investigation.",
            "Microglia, the CNS-resident innate immune cells, are considered to be in a chronic immunologically active alert state at steady-state within the CVOs presenting low BBB protection and high vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These microglia have an amoeboid instead of a surveilling (derived from to “surveil,” which means to keep a place or a person under surveillance) morphology (Davalos et al., 2005; Nimmerjahn et al., 2005) and express markers that suggest they are ready to cope with invading agents using phagocytosis and the release of various mediators such as pro-inflammatory cytokines (Takagi et al., 2019). A “primed” or pre-activated microglial state, instigated by previous encounter of inflammatory stimuli, might also lead the CVOs microglia to display an exaggerated response to subsequent challenges, of similar (viral infection with SARS-CoV-2) or different (e.g., psychological stress, gut dysbiosis, metabolic disorders, obesity, ageing, co-morbidities, and other environmental risk factors for disease) nature. Microglial surveillance of the parenchyma, but also contribution to the regulation of neuronal activity, myelination, as well as synaptic plasticity, and cognition, among others essential physiological roles (Salter and Beggs, 2014; Tay et al., 2019), could be reduced or compromised as a result of their resource-consuming immune involvement (Figure 2). Additionally, considering that amoeboid microglia are generally more mobile than surveilling ones (Savage et al., 2019), the migration of infected microglia from the CVOs to other brain regions could significantly contribute to spreading neuroinflammation.",
            "Across the brain, the microglial population comprises different subsets with unique intrinsic properties, performing somehow-specialised physiological functions (Stratoulias et al., 2019; Tan et al., 2020), that can adopt different phenotypes upon exposure to systemic challenges, and could play either complementary or perhaps completely opposing roles upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Determining how the different microglial subsets, located within the CVOs and other affected brain regions, respond to the infection is important, to identify the neuroinflammatory and/or compromised homeostatic functions to be normalised or restimulated. Studies should assess a panel of microglial phenotypic changes including cellular migration, process motility, phagocytosis, functional interactions with neurones, glial cells and components of the neurovascular unit but also epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic modifications, as well as release of mediators (e.g., trophic factors, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines). Considering that the microglial phenotypic properties are highly plastic and vary substantially in the course of disease progression, these changes in microglia should be investigated over time, ideally within longitudinal experimental studies, combining animal models and human investigations. This knowledge is crucial for the future design of targeted therapeutic interventions promoting beneficial microglial functions in COVID-19 patients.",
            "As the first responders of the CNS to trauma, injury and disease (Bilbo and Stevens, 2017), microglia are highly sensitive to peripheral metabolism and comorbidities, as well as external influences from the living environment such as the diet, physical activity, and exposure to pollution across life (Tay et al., 2017b; Madore et al., 2020). Depending on the parenchymal history, the cooperation from other brain cells, other components of the neurovascular unit and infiltrating peripheral cells, as well as messages received from the periphery, microglia could play different roles in determining the outcomes of COVID-19 on brain pathology. Even in patients having recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, microglia could remain primed via an innate immune memory transformation program mediated by epigenetic changes (Cheray and Joseph, 2018). With ageing, microglia could further become dystrophic or senescent (Streit, 2006; Streit et al., 2009; Spittau, 2017), unable then to perform efficiently their critical surveillance, immune and physiological roles. When and if CVOs microglia become dystrophic, the gate would be open, sentinels would fail and COVID-19 would rage.",
            "Microglial cells affected by stress, gut dysbiosis, metabolic disorders and obesity, physiological and cognitive ageing, and other environmental risk factors, could render individuals more at risk of developing neurological and psychiatric complications from COVID-19, even after complete clinical recovery from the infection. Various challenges from the external environment to which microglia respond, psychological or physiological, are associated with epigenetic, metabolic, proteomic, transcriptomic, densitometric, morphological/ultrastructural changes of these cells that can result in compromised molecular and cellular functions, normally required for brain health, including synaptic function and plasticity, myelination, and BBB maintenance (Tay et al., 2017b; Madore et al., 2020). Dysfunctional or aberrant microglial functions could severely impair cognitive functions, including judgment, decision making, learning and memory (Tay et al., 2017a), and hence might have critical outcomes on the short-, medium- or long-term neurological and psychiatric consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection that have been reported.",
            "Environmental challenges notably inducing stress are associated with an increased risk of developing major depression, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and several other neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions during life (Schneiderman et al., 2005; Knuesel et al., 2014; Furman et al., 2019). Psychological stress also significantly accelerates the progression of these conditions and exacerbates their symptoms. With ageing, the exposure to stressful events or systemic disorders can also trigger, exacerbate or accelerate cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Similarly, viral infections (e.g., with flu and pneumonia) can render individuals more prone to developing depression, psychosis, delirium, Parkinson's disease and other forms of dementia, among other conditions, and even more so with a chronic stress life history (Tate et al., 2014; Bisht et al., 2018). Providing insights into the mechanisms by which microglia exposed to SARS-CoV-2, notably in combination with psychological stress, anxiety and fear resulting from the pandemic situation (e.g., social isolation, disruption of daily activities, work from home, home schooling, etc.), contribute to the neurological and psychiatric aspects of COVID-19 is thus of utmost importance.",
            "In light of these findings highlighting the roles of microglia and their modification by infection and important other environmental risk factors, it will be important to characterise over time the microglial phenotypic transformation in clinically-defined cohorts of COVID-19-affected individuals, while controlling for inter-individual variability. In parallel, using preclinical animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, intervention strategies allowing the reprogramming of microglia phenotype in order to promote beneficial surveillance, immune and physiological functions, should be designed and ultimately tested in COVID-19-affected individuals.",
            "It is widely recognised that the SARS-CoV-2 virus induces heterogeneous reactions of the immune system, with some patients having none or mild immune responses while others developing cytokine storm and collateral systemic multiorgan damage, which often includes the brain (Chen et al., 2020; Chen and Li, 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020). Massive production of cytokines, a characteristic of severe COVID-19, leads to an indiscriminate immune attack on all cells of the human body. Lymphopenia, being another manifestation of a cytokine storm, occurs too, as in critically ill and non-surviving patients the lymphocyte counts were persistently low; conversely in survivors, lymphocyte counts gradually increased over the course of recovery (Huang et al., 2020; Wolfel et al., 2020; Wu and McGoogan, 2020). Sustained severe viral infection can result in both immune deficiencies, due to the burn-out of innate and adaptive immunities, and autoimmunity, due to the loss of self-tolerance by the immune system.",
            "Causes of neurological and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms in a sub-population of COVID-19 patients can be multiple, due to both systemic and intracranial immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, as well as to hypoxia and possibly intensive treatments (Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020). As a far-reaching arm for the immune-brain crosstalk, it has been long known that cytokines induced by pathogenic bacteria or viruses cause sickness behaviours that resemble depressive symptoms in animals (Hoogland et al., 2015), and offspring born by MIA pregnant mothers are susceptible for neurodevelopmental, neurological and psychiatric disorders (Bergdolt and Dunaevsky, 2019), as discussed in the next section.",
            "Meanwhile, autoimmunity may be another underlying mechanism for both the neurological (such as encephalitis and encephalopathy; Costello and Dalakas, 2020; Ellul et al., 2020) and psychiatric (such as psychosis and delirium; Hosseini et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Steardo et al., 2020b) manifestations in COVID-19. Autoimmune responses can be induced by viral pathogens, possibly through “molecular mimicry” (Cappello et al., 2020; Lucchese and Floel, 2020) and breakdown of physiological barriers (Alam et al., 2020; Buzhdygan et al., 2020), in which unleashed autoimmune cells cross-react to exposed autoantigens, hence causing autoimmune pathology. As an immune privileged site, nervous tissue is most vulnerable for autoimmune attack, which instigates various neurological and psychiatric diseases, such as the demyelinating multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barré syndrome (Giovannoni and Hartung, 1996), as well as the recently depicted autoimmune encephalitis (Dalmau et al., 2007; Granerod et al., 2010; Crisp et al., 2016) and autoimmune psychosis (Kayser et al., 2013; Al-Diwani et al., 2019; Pollak et al., 2020). Production of antiphospholipid autoantibodies was observed in some COVID-19 patients (Zhang et al., 2020); these autoantibodies can cause coagulopathy and cerebral infarction, conditions that have been frequently reported in victims of severe COVID-19 (Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) (Figure 1). Furthermore, several cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (Arnaud et al., 2020; Padroni et al., 2020; Sedaghat and Karimi, 2020; Tiet and AlShaikh, 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) and Miller-Fisher syndrome (Gutierrez-Ortiz et al., 2020) associated with COVID-19 have been reported across the world.",
            "As key components in compartmentalised immune responses of the CNS, both astrocytes and microglia contribute to CNS autoimmunity by regulating autoantigen-presentation, BBB or blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier breakdown and autoantibody leakage, as well as adaptive T- or B- cell activation for autoantibody production (Figure 1) (Ikeshima-Kataoka, 2016; Baecher-Allan et al., 2018; Dong and Yong, 2019). At this stage, it is necessary to understand whether COVID-19 patients who have recovered from cerebral infarction or sepsis might be more prone to producing autoantibodies and hence vulnerable to developing autoimmune encephalitis or psychosis in their later lives. Longitudinal clinical research would provide valuable knowledge in this sense. Besides, potential glia-mediated molecular mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 autoimmunity should also be considered in future animal research, such as disruption of the BBB and hence exposure of brain antigens to the peripheral immune system, enhanced CNS antigen-drainage via meningeal lymphatic and/or glymphatic systems, and intracranial antigen-presentation by astrocytes and microglia to infiltrated adaptive immune cells (Engelhardt et al., 2017). Currently, although the involvement of neurotropism and autoimmunity was suggested for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 neuropathies (Costello and Dalakas, 2020; Hosseini et al., 2020), there has been no solid clinical or preclinical evidence of autoantibodies positively detected in the CSF or blood of COVID-19 sufferers to support this notion.",
            "It should also be cautioned that although autoimmune response was observed in COVID-19, whether this is a transient event or even an epiphenomenon remains unclear since the underlying pathological mechanisms have not been characterised yet. Patients already affected by autoimmune diseases are, arguably, more susceptible for developing cytokine storm that can initiate or exacerbate autoimmune neurology (Askanase et al., 2020). Besides, cancer patients may also be a high-risk subgroup for both genetic and therapeutic reasons, considering that the most common autoimmune encephalitis originally discovered as a paraneoplastic syndrome occurs in 1–10% of malignant cancer patients, who usually receive immune-suppressive therapies such as corticosteroids (Dalmau et al., 2007). Among patients with autoimmune encephalitis, some present psychosis as their first or sometimes even the sole symptom, especially in the case of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis (Kayser et al., 2013; Al-Diwani et al., 2019; Pollak et al., 2020). On the other hand, autoantibodies are not all pathogenic, can even circulate in healthy subjects (Ehrenreich, 2018), and therefore increased autoimmunity may not be specific for COVID-19.",
            "In summary, whether SARS-CoV-2-derived viral protein can induce autoantibodies and whether this underlies the mechanisms of the observed demyelination or psychosis in COVID-19 warrant future research toward this direction using samples from COVID-19 patients or related animal models.",
            "Relations between COVID-19 and pregnancy are generally unknown because only a few cases have been hitherto documented, showing foetal distress and preterm delivery (Di Mascio et al., 2020; Matar et al., 2020). Preterm birth <37 weeks and caesarean delivery is common in pregnant women affected with COVID-19 (Di Mascio et al., 2020; Matar et al., 2020; Mullins et al., 2020). Premature labour, preeclampsia and foetal growth restriction were also observed (Di Mascio et al., 2020). Perinatal death and admission of newborns to neonatal intensive care unit were additionally higher. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the first trimester, evoked, in some cases, spontaneous abortion. In utero transmission has been described (Vivanti et al., 2020); in this instance the SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the amniotic fluid collected prior to the rupture of membranes. The infected neonate presented neurological manifestations soon after birth, which included a bilateral gliosis suggesting an early-life impact of COVID-19 on microglial (and astrocytic) status. Priming of microglia early in life may imprint the descendant's brains and thus cause a secondary event to increase their physiopathological reactions toward a subsequent stimulus. This over reaction may not be as beneficial as immunological memory, instead altering the beneficial physiological and immune functions of microglia on a long-term. It has recently been shown that oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, surviving an acute coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus) infection, persist in the CNS for at least 150 days (Pan et al., 2020). These surviving cells express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and other genes associated with a CNS inflammatory response and an extended inflammatory cell infiltration. Besides a direct transplacental transmission, SARS-CoV-2 maternal infection may have long-term consequences for the brain immunity of the descendants and thus may exert neurodevelopmental, neurological or neuropsychiatric consequences that are yet to be determined.",
            "The risk of developing neurodevelopmental, neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders in offspring of COVID-19-infected pregnant women is notable. Maternal infection alters neurodevelopment thus contributing to the aetiology of disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, juvenile epilepsy and schizophrenia that emerge during childhood or adolescence (Knuesel et al., 2014; Zeidan-Chulia et al., 2014; Estes and McAllister, 2016). MIA and its consequences on the CNS have been documented for diverse pathogens such as influenza or bacterial infections, implicating fevers, cytokine storms, and abnormal immune responses in triggering or sustaining a systemic inflammatory state (Reisinger et al., 2015; Estes and McAllister, 2016). However, several questions remain unaddressed regarding the impact of MIA on neuroinflammation and microglia especially during brain development in the offspring (Madore et al., 2016). The MIA-generalised inflammatory state is expected to modulate microglia, including their phenotypes and functions that are essential during development to correctly shape and maintain the synaptically-connected neuronal networks. As previously characterised in other maternal infection models, MIA-exposed microglia increase their expression of MHC class II that is coupled with an altered microglial transcriptome and with a reduced phagocytic and chemotactic activity (Mattei et al., 2017; Antonson et al., 2019; Purves-Tyson et al., 2019; Thion et al., 2019). Thus, an infection by SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy may lead to deleterious effects on microglial maturation, phenotypes and functions during neurodevelopment, and consequently increase the offspring vulnerability to developing later-on CNS disorders, the particular ones depending on when the infection occurs during gestation (Knuesel et al., 2014). These findings emphasise the importance of sizing the vulnerability and studying the potential neurodevelopmental impact of COVID-19 on the new generation. If SARS-CoV-2 leads to major increase of debilitating disorders in exposed offspring it may have profound socio-economic burden for years from now.",
            "Perinatal environment of SARS-CoV-2-infection impacting on neurodevelopmental pathologies is also preponderant. With the increase of preterm births and admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit, COVID-19 may add to the perinatal stress that is known to be deleterious on brain development (Schepanski et al., 2018; McPherson et al., 2020). Indeed, many epidemiological studies suggest that early-life adversity can be associated with an increased occurrence of neurodevelopmental, neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders later in life (Halligan et al., 2007; Lupien et al., 2009; Knuesel et al., 2014). Moreover, the detrimental consequences of early-life stress exposure on microglial maturation are multiple and thus would alter profoundly microglial physiological activities during development (Paolicelli and Ferretti, 2017). Another factor to consider is an increase in rate of caesarean deliveries. Most of the in utero exposed to COVID-19 were delivered by neonates caesarean section (Di Mascio et al., 2020; Matar et al., 2020), while it has been shown that caesarean section vs. vaginal deliveries may seriously impact infant immune maturation with consequences on the brain development (Curran et al., 2015a,b; Deoni et al., 2019). For instance, caesarean section-born babies were found to lack strains of commensal bacteria required to modulate immunity (Shao et al., 2019). There is a bidirectional crosstalk between the gut and the brain, notably exerted through peripheral immune cells and the vagus nerve, which may influence disease pathogenesis by acting on microglial maturation, function and reactivity to challenges (Erny et al., 2015; Thion et al., 2018; Cryan et al., 2019). It would thus be relevant to determine whether and how COVID-19 might impact on the regulation of microglial maturation and functions via a non-optimal gut microbiome composition as a result of the caesarean section delivery. Further prospective and longitudinal studies in children born from SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers are urgently needed to answer these pressing questions.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 maternal infection in combination with a non-adequate perinatal environment may have long-term consequences for the offspring's brain immunity. SARS-CoV-2 maternal infection may lead to an increased risk of developing neurodevelopmental, neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders later-on in life, making it critical to closely follow up and eventually prevent the onset of adverse consequences for human brain health in the descendants.",
            "Ageing increases the vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 and severity of COVID-19; the death rate in old population attained ~10% compare to overall death rate of 0.66% (Mahase, 2020). Similarly, neurological and cognitive deficits seem to be on increase in elderly with COVID-19 history (Devita et al., 2020; Varatharaj et al., 2020). Brain as an organ sustains ageing remarkably well; cognitive excellence sustains into ages when physical abilities are remarkably affected (Verkhratsky, 2019). However, the cognitive longevity is severely affected by neurodegenerative diseases, most of which do not have obvious genetic links but are age-dependent: ageing is the major risk factor for such disorders. There are increasing arguments for glial cells being responsible for defining the cognitive longevity and cognitive reserve (Rodriguez-Arellano et al., 2016).",
            "Ageing is associated with accumulation of dystrophic forms of glial cells, with loss of homeostatic and defensive support (Figure 2), with decrease in neurogenesis (which is the function of radial stem astrocytes, also influenced by neuroinflammation and microglial phagocytosis) and with failure of oligodendroglial precursors to sustain myelination (Streit et al., 2004; Sierra et al., 2014; Verkhratsky et al., 2015a, 2019; Tay et al., 2017b; Vanzulli et al., 2020). Glial cells in the older brains reduce their ability to mount gliotic response hence facilitating brain damage by imported pathogens (Verkhratsky et al., 2015b). Furthermore, the astroglia-based glymphatic waste collection system (Iliff et al., 2012) declines with age, which affects clearance of numerous by-products and toxic substances (Kress et al., 2014). All these widespread glial abnormalities, although being barely detectable in normal life, make the brain much more vulnerable to systemic pathologies and infectious damages. There is a well-defined link between systemic inflammation or major systemic diseases and cognitive deficits: systemic pathologies promote neurodegenerative process and accelerate cognitive decline (Perry et al., 2003). Thus, COVID-19 is not only deadly for old people, it may also have grave cognitive consequences.",
            "Overall, the findings discussed in this review indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a strong neurotropism that can result in both immune deficiencies, due to the burn-out of innate and adaptive immunities, and autoimmunity, due to the loss of self-tolerance by the immune system. These changes in the brain are mediated by astrocytes and microglia, which are the first responders of the brain to trauma, injury, infection and disease. The exposure to viral infection causes astrogliosis, a reprogramming of these cells associated with neuroprotection that also disrupts the BBB, inducing failure of this very important protection barrier against the deleterious consequences of systemic inflammation including the entry of peripheral immune cells and DAMPs into the brain. These effects are particularly pronounced in vulnerable areas of the brain lacking a BBB such as the CVOs. Similarly, infected microglia become primed, a phenotypic shift in which they display an exaggerated release of pro-inflammatory mediators and an aberrant phagocytic activity that induces neurodegeneration (killing neurones through their live engulfment named “phagoptosis”; Brown and Neher, 2014), synaptic loss (by several modalities that include “trogocytosis,” i.e., nibbling of small pieces of axon terminals; Weinhard et al., 2018), and demyelination (Traiffort et al., 2020), reflecting a loss of their beneficial functions in neuroprotection, synaptic maintenance, activity and/or plasticity, as well as myelination.",
            "These over-reactions of glial cells exposed to viral infection, notably with SARS-CoV-2, are further exacerbated when microglia are primed or immunologically alerted by the previous challenges they have encountered, which especially occurs in the areas of the brain devoid of a BBB such as the CVOs, whether these challenges result from comorbidity, chronic stress, dietary imbalance and gut dysbiosis, sleep disturbances, pollution, and/or other known epidemiological risk factors. Over time, the glial alterations result in cellular stress, ultrastructural alterations to organelles (e.g., mitochondria), and functional impairments that become progressively more pronounced during adulthood into ageing. With ageing, astrocytes and microglia become altered in various ways, adopting reactive and primed, but also dystrophic, senescent, dark, and disease-associated phenotypes that fail to maintain proper BBB function, brain homeostasis, neuronal circuit maintenance, activity and plasticity, sensorimotor gating, cognitive flexibility, judgment, decision making, and other behavioural outputs, thus triggering and accelerating the onset of cognitive decline, dementia, social dysfunction, depression, psychosis, other neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions with age, leading to premature death, across all walks of life. On the other end of the spectrum, offspring exposed to MIA induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection might be at particularly high risk of developing various neurodevelopmental, neurological and psychiatric conditions as a consequence of COVID-19 exposure, due to systemic inflammation (at a time when the BBB is still forming), gut-brain axis dysfunction and neuroinflammation leading to compromised physiological and immune glial cell functions throughout life.",

            "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected 771 million people and caused 6.9 million confirmed deaths as of November 2023. Beyond the adversity, a crucial and less-explored chapter unfolds: adaptive sequelae. These have altered social, mental, and emotional conditions, leaving an imprint on biological systems. While some cases fully resolve the pathological process post-acute infection, others persist with symptoms, posing a challenge that underscores the need to comprehend pathophysiology from innovative perspectives. The article delves into “Long COVID” or Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS), where symptoms persist for ≥4 weeks irrespective of initial severity. Risk factors include a history of severe illness, in-hospital management, and intensive care. This article also explores theories, derived from various experimental models, that have demonstrated the involvement of the nervous system in coordination with the psychoneuroimmunoendocrine axes in the expression of inflammation. It is posited that PACS involves processes of peripheral and central sensitization (corticalization), facilitating dishomeostasis and the chronicity of the inflammatory process. In this context, various therapeutic strategies grounded in modulating the inflammatory reflex are reviewed, primarily through the infiltration of local anesthetics via linear and non-linear approaches. Neural therapeutic use is considered to stimulate the regulatory inflammatory circuits coordinated by the neuroimmune-endocrine system.",
            "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (Ritchie et al., 2022) has affected 771 million people and caused 6.9 million confirmed deaths as of November 2023 (WHO, 2022). Beyond the adversity, a crucial and less-explored chapter emerges: its adaptive aftermath. These have altered social, mental, and emotional conditions, leaving an imprint on biological systems. Yet, the fact that some cases completely resolve the pathological process while others persist with symptoms after acute infection remains an enigma. This phenomenon poses a challenge that underscores the need to comprehend the pathophysiology from innovative perspectives, providing tools to address the post-pandemic landscape.",
            "Persistent symptoms following acute infection, occurring between 4 to 12 weeks, are termed Long COVID or post-acute COVID sequelae. When these symptoms persist for ≥4 weeks, it is referred to as Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS) (Nalbandian et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021; Greenhalgh et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023). These symptoms do not directly correlate with the severity of the acute infection, but there are risk factors such as a history of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2, in-hospital management, and intensive care. It is noteworthy that PACS can manifest in individuals with asymptomatic disease or without prior confirmed infection (Nalbandian et al., 2021). Despite the high effectiveness of vaccination in preventing severe acute illness from SARS-CoV-2, some authors have reported an increased risk of PACS if infection occurs within 14 days post-vaccination (Al-Aly et al., 2022) and on the other hand (Saheb Sharif-Askari et al., 2024) in a cohort study in 28,375 non-hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID 19 in Dubai, emphasize the potential benefits of pre-COVID vaccination and timely treatment in the prevention of Long COVID.",
            "To date, there is no diagnostic gold standard for Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS), and its symptoms are highly varied; moreover, they may be associated with other health issues (Nalbandian et al., 2021), complicating the diagnostic process. The multiorgan sequelae of PACS exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations (see Table 1), with the most common being fatigue (80%), weakness after physical exertion (73.3%), and cognitive impairment (58.4%), among others (Davis et al., 2021). Additionally, the pathophysiological mechanisms and effective therapeutic options have yet to be clearly defined (Nalbandian et al., 2021).",

In an observational study involving 3,762 patients from 56 countries, 62% presented with at least one persistent symptom at the 6-month mark (Davis et al., 2021). Due to the variability in clinical presentations and the diagnostic complexity of Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS), the prevalence remains uncertain, ranging between 5 and 80% (National Institutes of Health, 2021). The heterogeneity across studies underscores the necessity for more standardized diagnostic designs and prolonged follow-up.",
            "This article reviews the pathophysiology of Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS), focusing on mechanisms of the nonspecific response to disease, particularly inflammation. It explores the nonspecific response to threats (see Figure 1) through Nervism theory, highlighting neurogenic dystrophy as a fundamental component of all diseases according to A.D. Speransky and an indispensable precursor for the development of pathologies according to G.N. Kryzhanovskysirve. Tracey’s inflammatory reflex, Chiu’s neurogenic inflammation, and Klein’s neuroimmune axis are analyzed, comparing them with the central and peripheral sensitization model. The integration of these processes into the psychoneuroimmunoendocrine system is described. Additionally, other specific responses to SARS-CoV-2 related to symptom persistence are briefly addressed. Finally, it emphasizes how Neuraltherapeutic Medicine, using local anesthetics (AL), can modulate the nonspecific response and neurogenic inflammation.",

            "Throughout 170 years of history, the so-called Russian nervism school has left an indelible mark on the study of the nervous system (NS). Initiated by the synthetic physiology of Pavlov Smith G. P. (2000) and developed by Speransky (Speransky, 1954), Orbeli (1938), and Bykov (Bykov et al., 1958), this school has solidified the differential approach. Its concept of the living system as a biologically indivisible functional unit underscores the NS as the supreme director of all physiological and pathological processes (Sechenova et al., 1993; Ariza Tarazona et al., 2020).",
            "Speransky (1954) developed a theory aiming to generate a profound understanding, based on experimental foundations, of organisms’ responses to external irritating stimuli. This theory is grounded in reflex mechanisms of the nervous system, proposing a novel mechanism for the genesis of diseases overall. According to this theory, injurious stimuli have the potential to induce extreme irritation that affects tissue resilience—a phenomenon common to all pathophysiological processes known as the nonspecific response to damage, conceptualized by the theory of neurogenic dystrophies (Sechenova et al., 1993). This process, termed neurogenic tissue dystrophy, is caused by inadequate nervous influx to the involved tissue, disrupting the physiological cellular response and increasing tissue fragility, predisposing it to diseases (Akimov and Kositsyn, 2005).",
            "On the other hand, Bykov and Anichkov suggested the occurrence of a reflex dystrophy associated with irritation of reflexogenic zones (Забродин, 1999), possibly linked to associated neuroanatomical circuits.",
            "The influence of the nervous system (NS) on tissue homeostasis, along with its interaction with various physiological and pathophysiological phenomena, has been substantiated by other researchers. Its impact extends to cell division and differentiation (Bustamante et al., 2023), the modulation of hormonal or pharmacological responses (Sechenova et al., 1993; Akimov and Kositsyn, 2005), as well as changes in tissue ultrastructure and cytochemical profile (Tweedle et al., 1975; Kositsyn, 1978). Furthermore, regulatory effects on gene expression in tumors and their surrounding microenvironment have been observed (Cole et al., 2015). Its documented influence spans cellular metabolic processes (Pavlov and Tracey, 2012), thermogenesis, modulation of immunity, acute and chronic inflammation, and tissue repair (Tracey, 2002; Pavlov and Tracey, 2012; Klein Wolterink et al., 2022).",
            "These findings support that the nervous system (NS) maintains the structural stability, functions, energy, and plastic processes of cells, tissues, organs, and the organism as a whole (Забродин, 1999).",
            "Secondary reflex responses to irritative processes coordinated by the NS involve nonlinear physiological mechanisms that can be summarized into three main types (Speransky, 1954; Engel et al., 2022):",
            "Direct local irritation: is generated by the direct irritation of the tissue and its corresponding nociceptors.",
            "Segmental metameric irritation: is grounded in the embryogenesis of various tissues. This is primarily interconnected through the nervous system (NS), establishing segmental circuits that regulate function and communication between diverse structures. Reflex irritation from these circuits can trigger responses that impact innervation and, consequently, the function of related anatomical structures.",
            "Meta-segmental irritation: is a reflex response that extends beyond the segment and lacks a local or embryogenic basis. It is currently referred to as “neuromodulatory trigger points” according to Engel et al. (Engel et al., 2022). Other authors have described it as a “neural interference field,” especially in the context of the Neural Therapy school according to Huneke (Dosch and Dosch, 2007). Although its pathophysiological mechanism is not fully understood, it pertains to cortical coupling phenomena described by temporal associations of the nervous system, such as Pavlov’s conditioned reflex (Bykov et al., 1958), as well as polysegmental neuroanatomical connections (Engel et al., 2022).",
            "These connections can influence irritation and reflex responses in distant anatomical sites, emphasizing the complexity of interactions within the nervous system.",
            "Bustamante et al. (Bustamante et al., 2023), Tracey (Tracey, 2002), Klein et al. (Klein Wolterink et al., 2022), and Chiu et al. (Chiu et al., 2012) have proposed that the nervous system (NS) and the immune system interact, forming the neuroimmune circuit to regulate homeostasis through the inflammatory reflex, also known as the neural phase of inflammation (see Figure 2). This process modulates the innate and adaptive immune response within seconds, acting as an autonomic reflex. The afferent pathway detects immune products secondary to tissue injury or infection through nerve terminals (Tracey, 2002), while the efferent pathway regulates the phenotypic expression of immune cells and the release of cytokines. The parasympathetic pathway is associated with anti-inflammation, whereas the sympathetic pathway is pro-inflammatory (Tracey, 2002; Chiu et al., 2012; Davidson et al., 2014; Cook et al., 2018; Klein Wolterink et al., 2022); this interaction becomes even more complex with a system of cells and chemical mediators such as neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and cytokines interacting with each other (Goldstein, 2020).",
            "Neuroimmune circuit: bidirectional communication between the nervous system and the immune system through cellular phases and chemical signaling. The intricate interplay is established by neurotransmitters binding to immune cell membrane receptors and also by cytokines interacting with nerve cell membrane receptors. (Source: Own elaboration).",
            "Autonomic dysfunction of this inflammatory reflex, secondary to nociceptor sensitization, leaves the NS in a hyper-vigilant state (Cook et al., 2018), also known as “hyperinflammatory reflex” according to Engel et al. (Engel et al., 2022). This state triggers an axonal reflex that can induce neurogenic inflammation, leading to an increase in oxidative stress and its adverse effects. These alterations affect the biophysical properties of neuronal membrane potential, contributing to the development of intractable pain (Cook et al., 2018). In animal models, enteric inflammation affects sympathetic and sensory innervation, resulting in hypersensitivity associated with inflammatory bowel disease (Meade and Garvey, 2022).",
            "Peripheral sensitization is defined as an increase in the sensitivity of nociceptors at the peripheral nerve endings of the body, facilitating the onset of pain and other discomfort. This phenomenon leads to changes in membrane potential and electrochemical balance, resulting from alterations in the redox balance, primarily induced by an increased production of free radicals (Davidson et al., 2014). Meanwhile, central sensitization at the spinal and cerebral levels amplifies nociceptive signals from the nervous system. Both phenomena generate inflammatory responses that contribute to the injury and dysfunction of the affected tissues (Davidson et al., 2014).",
            "The role of the nervous system (NS) in the trophic processes of all biological systems in the human body is closely tied to the information systems that integrate the complexity of organisms. Once considered isolated feedback systems, Goldstein (Goldstein, 2020) now refers to it as the “extended” autonomic nervous system with neuroimmuneendocrine circuits that interact harmoniously to maintain homeostatic balance. The cellular and chemical communication phase of this neuroimmuneendocrine system (NIES) shares common receptors and ligands, constituting interdependent axes of bioregulation (González-Díaz et al., 2017; Goldstein, 2020).",
            "In 1891, Smith G. P. (2000) initiated research on digestive processes in dogs in his own laboratory, work that would earn him the Nobel Prize in physiology. His findings demonstrated that psychic variables influence physiological reactions, marking the beginning of his explorations into classical conditioning (Bykov et al., 1958). Subsequently, in 1975, Ader and Cohen (González-Díaz et al., 2017) described the integration of the psyche into the NIES, considering the psyche as a key determinant of biological response. This integration gives rise to a unique system called the psychoneuroimmunoendocrine system (see Figure 3), responsible for adaptive responses to various influences, both external and internal.",
            "Information systems or psychoneuroimmunoendocrine axis. At the top within the human being, the psyche or consciousness harbors thoughts and emotions. The communication interface between the psyche and the physical body is carried out through the nervous system. The neuroimmune axis transmits chemical signals through cytokines and neurotransmitters. The neuroendocrine axis involves chemical transmitters, such as hormone-releasing factors and hormones. The immunoendocrine axis comprises chemical transmitters of hormones and cytokines. This dynamic adaptation of the unity of being takes place through feedback loops between the axes, adjusting to the internal circumstances of the human body and the external conditions of the ecosystem. Thus, the unity of being is configured, establishing a direct and continuous relationship with the environment. (Source: Own elaboration).",
            "Selye (1990) defines stress as a nonspecific response to a demand imposed on the body Selye H. (1946). When the compensatory mechanism fails, regardless of its origin, it exhibits fundamental characteristics of “dishomeostasis,” according to Goldstein, in the context of critical illness and chronic disease. These aspects support that dysfunction of the nervous system, known as dysautonomia, along with inflammation and dishomeostasis, are central mechanisms underlying the development and perpetuation of multiorgan failure (Toner et al., 2013; Zalewski et al., 2018).",
            "Integrating the explored concepts (synthetic physiology, neurogenic dystrophy, inflammatory reflex, neuroimmune circuit, central and peripheral sensitization, and neurogenic inflammation as part of the nonspecific response) provides new elements for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms triggered by SARS-CoV-2 injury that persists over time with Long COVID (Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, SPAC).",
            "Chronic inflammation is a common denominator in the pathophysiology of various chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular, respiratory, mental, epilepsy, obesity, and autoimmune diseases, among others (Tracey, 2002). The neuropathology of PACS is characterized by involvement of the nervous system (NS), dysautonomia, and subsequent neurogenic inflammation (Li et al., 2023). This process is imperative in the development of PACS and contributes to the understanding of related chronic diseases.",
            "Publications correlate Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) with PACS, manifesting overlapping symptoms between both pathologies (Engel et al., 2022). In the early 20th century, Speransky (Speransky, 1954) proposed that a nonspecific stimulus associated with injury, either by its intensity and/or frequency, could trigger neurogenic dystrophy with disseminated encephalomyelitis, as demonstrated in animal experimental models.",
            "Similarly, ME/CFS can be preceded by nonspecific triggering factors, such as viral, bacterial, parasitic (acute or chronic) infections, toxic exposures, vaccination, and trauma (physical or emotional) (DynaMed, n.d.). Other functional somatic syndromes without apparent cause, such as irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, temporomandibular disorders, vulvodynia, and interstitial cystitis, have been considered as dysautonomias (Meade and Garvey, 2022). Although the relationship is not linear, dysautonomic activation and hyperinflammatory reflex are common patterns in the expression of these syndromes.",
            "VanElzakker hypothesizes that during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, the terminal axons of the vagus nerve (VN) and other nerves in the respiratory epithelium become sensitized by immune factors. The reflex response involves various levels of the NS, such as the dorsal brainstem, the Nucleus Tractus Solitarius, and parabrachial regions with glial activation, manifesting systemic symptoms like fatigue, fever, myalgia, among others. These symptoms are common in the clinical expression of ME/CFS and PACS. As part of this reflex response, a “corticalization” pathway is observed, where peripheral sensitization spreads centrally, transmitting inflammatory signals from VN terminals to the brainstem, limbic system, and neocortex (Figure 4) (VanElzakker, 2013).",
            "Sensitization processes: with nonlinear mechanisms following SARS-CoV-2 infection including: (A) sensitization-irritation of peripheral receptor through immunological synapse with immune cell or directly by the virus, (B) sensitization-irritation of the vagus nerve, (C) sensitization-irritation of the brainstem solitary tract nucleus and parabrachial regions, (D) sensitization-irritation of the limbic system, (E) sensitization-irritation of the cortex (Source: Own elaboration).",
            "The brainstem plays a fundamental role in the neural phase of the neuroimmune circuit and in the process of central sensitization, characterized by dysfunctional signaling of this component, which could be a key factor in PACS symptoms (Proal and VanElzakker, 2021). In autopsies of corpses affected by SARS-CoV-2, immune activation has been identified in the brainstem (Solomon, 2021). Furthermore, various studies have reported functional and structural abnormalities of the brainstem in ME/CFS (Shan et al., 2020), along with glial activation and cognitive impairment (Nakatomi et al., 2014). It is important to note that central sensitization of the brainstem can also be triggered by infections and inflammatory events “occurring outside the NS,” such as nonspecific injurious stimuli (Proal and VanElzakker, 2021).",
            "Within the NS, mast cells and microglia are activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. The inflammatory cascade is largely maintained by exposure to “multiple hits,” which are diverse inflammatory events that collectively amplify their signaling (Proal and VanElzakker, 2021). Once activated, these immune cells retain a prepared functional state, leading to an even more robust response to subsequent challenges. This prepared state may also be crucial in symptoms such as sensory sensitivity in individuals who have survived acute neuroinflammatory events, such as encephalitis or concussion, or who may have low levels of persistent or latent neurotropic pathogenic microorganisms, including the herpes virus, among others (Proal and VanElzakker, 2021).",
            "Any stimulus inducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines in a region of the body innervated by the VN can initiate or perpetuate this pathological response and associated chronic symptoms (Proal and VanElzakker, 2021).",
            "The specific responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that contribute to the development of SPAC include: direct tissue damage in one or multiple organs, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs in certain tissues, reactivation of neurotrophic pathogens such as herpesviruses under conditions of immune dysregulation induced by SARS-CoV-2, interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with the host’s microbiome/virome communities, and autoimmunity due to molecular mimicry between the pathogen and host proteins (Proal and VanElzakker, 2021).",
            "SARS-CoV-2, similar to other virulent coronaviruses, initially enters through the respiratory epithelium using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. These receptors are expressed in cells of the respiratory system, brain endothelium, vascular smooth muscle, as well as gastrointestinal epithelial cells, pancreatic cells, and renal podocytes (Hamming et al., 2004). Although the mechanism of extrapulmonary spread is not yet clear, direct tissue damage from infection may be a primary mechanism contributing to long-term complications (Wiersinga et al., 2020).",
            "Neuroinfection and subsequent neuroinflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 have been documented in autopsy models, animal trials, and organoids. Infection can spread hematogenously through the blood–brain barrier or through the mechanism known as the “Trojan Horse,” in which immune cells infected with intracellular pathogens are actively transported to the central nervous system. Additionally, retrograde transport of the virus through neuronal axons has been observed, originating from the olfactory, glossopharyngeal, or vagus nerves (Proal and VanElzakker, 2021). In some patients with neuroinflammation and conditions like ME/CFS, the possibility of viral or bacterial pathogens infecting the vagus nerve has been established (VanElzakker, 2013).",
            "In some cases, persistent symptoms may be related to prolonged infection with SARS-CoV-2, where the virus is not cleared for extended periods. The presence of viral reservoirs in tissues is evidenced by traces of positive PCR and amplified CD8 T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. Despite obtaining a negative PCR, the virus may persist in tissues, a phenomenon observed with other neurotropic viruses (Plebani, 2021; Proal and VanElzakker, 2021), thus perpetuating the low-grade chronic immune response and inflammation.",
            "Autopsies have revealed persistent infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the human nervous system (Stein et al., 2022). Both SARS-CoV-2 and other neurotropic pathogens could be reactivated by acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. These pathogens rarely persist in the blood, typically being identified in tissues or nerves (Proal and VanElzakker, 2021).",
            "Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can trigger “autoantibodies” due to similarities in sequence with proteins or metabolites derived from the virus and the host’s own tissues. An important aspect in the study of PACS involves the analysis of the immune system and these autoantibodies as part of the underlying mechanisms (Proal and VanElzakker, 2021).",
            "Genetic variations in the immune response, coagulation, or expression of human endogenous retroviruses are associated with an increased risk of developing PACS. However, in a study involving twins, non-heritable factors were found to determine more than half of the variability in immune parameters. These findings highlight how at least one type of microbial exposure can significantly modulate the overall immune profile of healthy individuals (Brodin et al., 2015).",
            "The human body’s microbiome consists of diverse and abundant microorganisms. During SARS-CoV-2 infection and PACS, changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiome have been identified (Liu et al., 2022). This dysbiosis of the microbiota/virome can have a profound impact on the host’s genetics, immunity, metabolism, hormones, and nervous system (Ursell et al., 2012). During acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, some microorganisms undergo changes in their balance. This alteration may persist, allowing inactive pathogens to reactivate, colonize new sites, and trigger chronic symptoms (Proal and VanElzakker, 2021).",
            "In the “multiple-hit model,” one pathogen can support the virulence of the next infection (Proal and Marshall, 2018). In the acute progression of SARS-CoV-2 or PACS, persistent pathogens can be considered predisposing factors (Proal and VanElzakker, 2021), as they overload the neuroimmune circuit, predisposing it to a state of alertness or irritation (Pavlov and Tracey, 2012; Proal and VanElzakker, 2021).",
            "Human bacteria have been shown to play a role in the production and/or consumption of various neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (Galland, 2014). Furthermore, proteins and metabolites derived from the microbiota/virome influence the activity of immune cells. Alterations in host signaling or the permeability of the gastrointestinal epithelial barrier, resulting from dysbiosis, could be contributors to the onset of PACS (Proal and VanElzakker, 2021).",
            "Hydration and nutritional status are fundamental pillars of the body’s capacity to respond to various stimuli. Dehydration and nutritional deficiencies are associated with alterations in the neuroimmunoendocrine response, stress, and aging, thus impacting general health status El-Sharkawy, et al., 2015; López Plaza, et al., 2017; Birnkrant, et.al., 2018; Moszak, et al,. 2020; Zhao, et al., 2020; Ciebiera, et al., 2021; Arab, et al., 2023; Schloss JV, 2023.",
            "The evidence supporting the importance of stress-induced deficiencies in nutrients such as magnesium, zinc, iron, calcium, and niacin is strong (Ramsey et al., 2020). While it is crucial to acknowledge the impact of individual nutrients, it’s essential to understand that the biological response to stress cannot be simplified to a single nutrient The synergistic interaction of macronutrients and micronutrients, encompassing high-quality sources of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids, along with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, enzymes, coenzymes, and the contributions of phytochemicals, supports optimal biological function.",
            "Maintaining adequate hydration and nutrition enhances resilience and improves the ability to adapt to both internal and external stressors. In the specific case of PACS, adequate hydration is an important factor in complete recovery (Barrea et al., 2022).",
            "Some foods have shown notable effects on inflammatory pathways and have the potential to modulate inflammatory imbalances. Therefore, the careful selection of anti-inflammatory foods, while avoiding those with pro-inflammatory potential, is recommended as a fundamental strategy to alleviate diseases characterized by a significant inflammatory component in their pathophysiology. Moreover, a diet rich in anti-inflammatory nutrients, such as the Mediterranean diet, may prove beneficial in ameliorating sequelae secondary to COVID (Ricker and Haas, 2017; Ramsey et al., 2020).",
            "Several clinical trials confirm the positive response of monotherapy with 22 different nutrients (cobalamin, calcium, zinc, thiamine, pyridoxine, asparagine, magnesium, niacinamide, riboflavin, oleic acid, glutamine, inositol, choline, selenium, vitamin D, iron, taurine, phosphorus, ascorbate, bioflavonoids, N-aceyl cysteine) on the probability of contracting COVID-19 and the severity of the disease (Ramsey et al., 2020). However, the response to monotherapy with these nutrients may be influenced by the nutritional exposome, biochemical individuality of each person, the concomitant deficiency of other nutrients and the special nutritional needs induced by the stress of dysfunction.",
            "Supplementation with molecules like coenzyme Q10 and alpha-lipoic acid, targeting antioxidant cellular pathways, presents intriguing alternatives explored in treating conditions with chronic inflammation, such as PACS (Tasneem et al., 2019; Akanchise and Angelova, 2023).",
            "A wide variety of medicinal plants, such as Camellia Sinensis, Tripterygium Wilfordii Hook F, and Zingiber officinale, among others, display anti-inflammatory effects (Bustamante et al., 2023). Essential oils from species such as Eucalyptus, Cinnamomum, and Juniperus exhibit therapeutic potential in modulating immunity, reducing inflammation, and exerting antiviral effects. These plants and oils contain various phytochemicals, including phenolics, terpenoids, and alkaloids, which individually exhibit anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antiviral properties with curative potential for COVID-19 (Barletta et al., 2023).",
            "The hydration and nutritional status significantly influence disease expression. While discussing the entire spectrum of therapeutic uses of diets, nutrients, phytochemicals, and essential oils is extensive, certain key areas and their direct impact on the neuroimmunoendocrine system and associated biological responses merit attention.",
            "Neuraltherapeutic Medicine (NTM) (more commonly known as Neural Therapy) arises from the conjunction of understanding the synthetic physiology of Nervism with the discovery of the modulating effects of Local Anesthetics (LAs) on the nervous system, known as the neuraltherapeutic effect.",
            "Researchers such as Speransky, Bykov, Orbeli, and Vischnevsky confirmed Pavlov’s experimental findings and used infiltrations of LAs, known as “novocainic blocks,” to address nervous system dysfunctions (Забродин, 1999). Rather than a simple transient anesthetic block, they described a lasting neuraltherapeutic effect that persists after the direct pharmacological effect, stimulating natural regulatory reflexes, such as anti-inflammation, that were somehow dysregulated. This approach allowed them, in a surgical context, to manage critical acute conditions such as septic or hypovolemic shock in war victims (Sechenova et al., 1993) and to modulate inflammation in both acute and chronic inflammatory and infectious pathologies, in both humans and animal models (Ariza Tarazona et al., 2020).",
            "In Germany, a medical school named “Neural Therapy according to Huneke” was born, later enriched by scientific research from around the world. It presents itself as a therapeutic option to modulate the reflexes of the nervous system. In Colombia, a new school emerged in the 1970s, led by Julio Payán, which not only integrates Russian nervism and the foundations of the German school but also undergoes conceptual and scientific enrichment from the complexity sciences, leading to a change in its name to Neuraltherapeutic Medicine (Bustamante et al., 2023).",
            "This school distinguishes itself by incorporating into its theoretical framework the concept of stimulating the psychoneuroimmunoendocrine system to modulate the nonspecific pathophysiological mechanism of neurogenic dystrophy and, consequently, inflammation. Additionally, it integrates reflex mechanisms of central (including the concept of corticalization) and peripheral sensitization in the process of neurogenic inflammation. These concepts manifest coherently within the semiological approach to patients and in diagnostic and therapeutic orientations, which focus depending on the level of irritation (local, segmental, or meta-segmental) (Ariza Tarazona et al., 2020).",
            "Neuraltherapeutic Medicine, through stimuli applied to anatomical structures, usually through the use of Local Anesthetics (LAs) such as low-concentration procaine (between 0.5 and 1%), modulates the regulatory and plastic functions of the nervous system. Such application of procaine is usually very well tolerated, with minimal effects in patients such as transient dizziness and metallic taste (Dosch and Dosch, 2007). There is evidence of the neuroimmunomodulatory action of LAs, more extensively studied in inflammatory conditions and pain (Akimov and Kositsyn, 2005; Engel et al., 2022; Bustamante et al., 2023; Vinyes et al., 2023). Furthermore, other pathways of action on the information system that have not been completely elucidated have been indicated, such as influence through the microtubules of the living matrix (Cruz, 2011; Liu and Duricka, 2022; Bustamante et al., 2023).",
            "Several authors have explored the therapeutic effect of Local Anesthetics (LA) on the Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PACS), albeit diverging from the conceptual framework of Neuraltherapeutic Medicine. For instance, Liu reported symptom resolution in two PASC patients through the use of LA in two consecutive procedures near the stellate ganglion. Galvin conducted a retrospective review of medical records involving 195 PACS patients, noting statistically significant improvements in most symptoms following stellate ganglion block (Galvin et al., 2023). Typically, 5 mL of local anesthetic is used for this procedure (Restrepo-Garcés et al., 2012). Both authors describe the therapeutic effect as sympathetic blockade and acknowledge a lack of understanding of mechanisms beyond the anesthetic (Liu and Duricka, 2022).",
            "Stellate ganglion block (SGB) can lead to various complications, including Horner’s syndrome and potential impacts on nearby nerve structures like the recurrent laryngeal nerve, resulting in dysphonia, dysphagia, and dyspnea. Major risks involve inadvertent vascular injection causing seizures and cardiovascular toxicity, and neuroaxial block, often requiring immediate support. Other potential complications include esophageal perforation and thyroid puncture, which may lead to neck hematomas (Restrepo-Garcés et al., 2012).",
            "Vinyes et al. (Vinyes et al., 2022), specifically, detailed a successful Neuraltherapeutic Medicine approach in a PACS patient, involving three procedures over 8 weeks with a 16-week follow-up. While Liu and Galvin follow a linear thinking approach with a standardized, non-individualized procedure, Vinyes considers a nonlinear approach, investigating the patient’s past irritations throughout their life history, thus defining therapeutic orientations under this rationale.",
            "The experience with neural therapeutic approaches, documented across centers in Switzerland (Mermod et al., 2008), Germany (Joos et al., 2011), Spain (Roca et al., 2010), and Colombia (Sarmiento Rodríguez, 2014), among other countries, has yielded promising outcomes in managing diverse chronic conditions. Presently, 14 scientific associations are affiliated with the International Federation of Medical Associations of Neural Therapy (IFMANT) (https://www.ifmant.at/es/), n.d. underscoring the increasing global recognition and adoption of this therapeutic modality.",
            "Few therapeutic advances address the modulation of the neuroimmune circuit. Some studies emphasize the role of the vagus nerve (VN), a key representative of the parasympathetic nervous system, and the stimulation of the anti-inflammatory cholinergic efferent arm through implantable and external electronic devices, but these are costly and have limited access (Johnson and Wilson, 2018). Other researchers have explored the possibility of preventing neurogenic dystrophy by using adrenergic blockers during injury (Akimov and Kositsyn, 2005), but these remain limited.",
            "Neurofeedback and biophotomodulation are potential non-invasive therapeutic tools in modulating inflammation of neurogenic origin, although there are no specific studies on their impact on the inflammatory reflex, these techniques have shown improvement in diseases with an inflammatory component and oxidative stress of the nervous system. Such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s (Berman and Nichols, 2019).",

            "In the pathophysiology of PACS, various hypotheses are proposed that involve common patterns of nonspecific response, such as inflammation and dysautonomia. These patterns may compromise the function of the neuroimmune-endocrine system, leaving it hypervigilant, primed, or hyperexcited, triggering neurogenic inflammation following neurogenic dystrophy. Although these patterns are also described in functional syndromes, from the perspective of nervism and Pavlovian synthetic physiology, they are involved in all pathophysiological processes.",
            "Expanding the paradigm involves recognizing the crucial role of information systems in integrating the unity of organisms. Although the existential dilemmas of the psyche or soul and their physiological repercussions are not delved into, emerging approaches in medicine include innovative concepts of the neuroimmune-endocrine system in modulating all processes of the living body. It is worth highlighting the process of inflammation and tissue repair as a cornerstone of health and disease.",
            "Neurogenic tissue dystrophy underlies the local, segmental, or distant clinical expression. This process resembles the model of central and peripheral sensitization. The described segmental irritation refers to the classic anatomical model of deep and superficial innervation, related in a transversal reflex arc from the somite to the medullary level. On the other hand, neuromodulatory trigger points correspond to polysegmental anatomical circuits, temporal associations, and other information interactions not yet described.",
            "Neuraltherapeutic stimulation transcends the direct pharmacological response provided by the transient anesthesia of Local Anesthetics (LA). Potentially, this stimulation modulates nervous influx in tissues, simultaneously influencing physiological and pharmacological responses, especially in inflammatory processes. This capability involves modulating the non-specific response of the Neuroimmune-Endocrine System (SNIE), enhancing the resilience of the biological system independently of the specific mechanisms of the disease cause. This therapeutic modality could be potentially useful in pathologies with neurogenic inflammation, such as Post-COVID-19 Accumulative Syndrome (PACS).",

            "Stroke is a fatal morbidity that needs emergency medical admission and immediate medical attention. COVID-19 ischemic brain damage is closely associated with common neurological symptoms, which are extremely difficult to treat medically, and risk factors. We performed literature research about COVID-19 and ischemia in PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus for this current narrative review. We discovered parallel manifestations of SARS-CoV-19 infection and brain ischemia risk factors. In published papers, we discovered a similar but complex pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and stroke pathology. A patient with other systemic co-morbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, or any respiratory disease, has a fatal combination in intensive care management when infected with SARS-CoV-19. Furthermore, due to their shared risk factors, COVID-19 and stroke are a lethal combination for medical management to treat. In this review, we discuss shared pathophysiology, adjuvant risk factors, challenges, and advancements in stroke-associated COVID-19 therapeutics.",
            "The current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, also known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), was caused by a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2). Wuhan, China, was the site of the first reports of an atypical pneumonia outbreak with an unknown etiology in December 2019 [1]. Initially, local clinicians diagnosed it as virus-based pneumonia or virus-induced pneumonia and respiratory illness based on the symptoms and clinical diagnosis. Cases continued to emerge quickly, and the etiological agent, a novel coronavirus strain (2019-nCoV), was identified by 2020 [2]. A new coronavirus was discovered in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid/saliva of infected patients at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. After a virological research investigation, it was discovered to be an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, a member of the Coronavirus family, the same virus family associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [3]. Later, WHO designated a virus with many new names: Wuhan coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV-2, and novel coronavirus (nCoV)—based on the epidemic’s original location: Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in 2019. The disease is classified as COVID-19 disease, and symptoms range from asymptomatic to severe. Epidemiologic clinical studies and case reports from around the world have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can cause significant respiratory, hepatic, and neurological complications [4,5,6,7,8]. Aging, diabetes, hypertension, neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, high inflammatory indicators, and coagulopathy are also major causes of death and breathing distress in COVID-19 patients. Since the beginning of the global pandemic, the most common COVID-19 symptoms have been fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue [9]. Dyspnea, a high breathing rate, and low blood oxygen saturation levels are all symptoms of severe COVID-19. Some coronavirus patients, particularly those over 65 and those with chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and pulmonary asthma, may be at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ dysfunction [10,11]. Critical disease symptoms include respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiple organ failure (MOF) [12]. Accumulating evidence also indicated that one-third of the affected population experienced neurological symptoms, such as dizziness, headache, myalgia, impaired consciousness, ageusia, anosmia, encephalitis, and cerebrovascular stroke, with nerve pain, visual impairment, seizure, occipital neuralgia, and ataxia being uncommon [1,13,14,15,16,17]. SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to affect both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), resulting in neurological symptoms and complications. SARS-CoV-2 can enter the CNS directly, via retrograde neuronal transport within vagal nerve afferents, or via transcribrial route or through infiltrate with infected leukocytes [18,19]. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 can compromise the blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity by targeting angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors found on the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the brain, promoting BBB permeability and viral entry into the CNS [20,21]. COVID-19 may cause ischemic stroke through hypercoagulability, severe inflammation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction, and the effects of severe respiratory illness, according to this. In addition to traditional stroke mechanisms, hypercoagulability, severe inflammation, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction, and the consequences of severe respiratory illness are potential mechanisms of ischemic stroke associated with COVID-19. Patients who have excessive coagulation, blood stasis, and endothelial damage are also predisposed to thrombosis and, as a result, stroke. Stroke is currently the world’s second leading cause of death, according to the latest WHO report, and one of the common health issues in the developed countries. It is a serious neurological complication that has been observed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Blockage of an artery as well as rupturing or injury to the artery itself can result in stroke, which can be classified as ischemic, hemorrhagic, or traumatic stroke. Stroke incidence has been observed in approximately 1 to 3% of COVID-19 inpatients, indicating high odds of stroke in more severe COVID-19 subjects.",
            "A PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus review was carried out to identify all studies dealing with ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients. The following search terms were used from database inception to December 2020: stroke, ischemic stroke, SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. A total of 3182 articles, including those listed in the references of the retrieved studies, were found originally. We then excluded the following items: all publications not dealing with ischemic stroke and COVID-19 or neuropathology; all studies different from original articles (e.g., case report/case series, letters, commentaries, etc.); all preclinical studies or research performed on animals or cell cultures; non-English written papers; and any other publication that did not comply with the goal of the present review. Further relevant references were identified from the bibliography of extracted articles as needed. After this process, a total of 88 studies were included in this review.",
            "Stroke appears to be uncommon in the COVID-19 setting [22,23]. In terms of prevalence, ischemic stroke outnumbers hemorrhagic stroke. The rates of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage associated with COVID-19 in hospitalized patients ranged from 0.4 to 2.7 percent and 0.2 to 0.9 percent, respectively. Furthermore, cryptogenic stroke accounts for 10–30% of all ischemic strokes and is directly related to COVID-19 disease [24]. The rates of COVID-19-related cerebrovascular incidents are primarily based on retrospective cohort studies of COVID-19-treated patients hospitalized in various epicenters around the world, including China, Spain, and the United States [24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32]. These reports cover a wide range of populations in terms of disease severity, co-morbidities, and follow-up periods, all of which can lead to stroke. Nonetheless, the risk of stroke varies depending on the severity of COVID-19. According to early case reports, the risk is 1% for patients with minor illnesses, but it may be as high as 6% for patients in intensive care [14]. Stroke usually occurs 1–3 weeks after ongoing COVID-19 symptoms, but in a small number of reported patients, stroke was the first symptom that led to hospitalization [33,34]. Two patients in a group of ten COVID-positive patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy for major artery blockage exhibited no signs of COVID-19 prior to the onset of the stroke [34]. In separate research of 32 hospitalized patients with ischemic stroke and COVID-19, it was observed that stroke was the primary reason for admission in 44% of the cases [24]. COVID-19, on the other hand, appears to be an independent risk factor for in-hospital stroke [33].",
            "In COVID-19 patients, the risk of ischemic stroke is increasing. Ischemic stroke is the most common cerebrovascular complication reported in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, there have been reports of cerebral sinus thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage [26,35,36]. The mechanisms of stroke in COVID-19 are proposed to be multifaceted, involving both specific pathophysiological features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as endothelial activation and thrombosis, as well as nonspecific effects of impaired coagulation and inflammation, which are superimposed on preexisting risk factors [24,37]. In addition, several cases of cryptogenic stroke in COVID-19 patients suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can cause stroke via atypical or novel mechanisms, such as COVID-19 infection-associated hypercoagulability and a pro-inflammatory state [38,39,40]. Analysis of the clot waveform has shown hypercoagulability that precedes or coincides with severe disease [38,40]. Hypercoagulability, together with a systemic inflammatory response to viral infection, could lead to the formation of macro- and micro-thrombi, ultimately causing cerebrovascular accidents [38]. A thromboelastography study of the coagulation profile in critical COVID-19 patients yielded consistency with a hypercoagulative state. A substantial increase in factor VIII has been hypothesized to be associated with COVID-19-related hypercoagulability [39]. Activation of the complement pathway, inflammatory cytokines, as well as cytoplasmic microparticles originating from platelets or lymphocytes could also induce hypercoagulative state [38,39].",
            "Age, gender, ethnicity, and genetics are traditional stroke risk factors, as are vascular risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cardioembolism, atrial fibrillation, obesity, inflammation, and infection [41,42]. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is required in conditions such as hypercoagulability, thrombosis, and coagulopathy. When comparing COVID-19-related stroke cases to older patients with vascular risk factors, data analysis from several reports shows that younger patients with low prevalence of standard stroke risk factors and elevated markers of inflammation (ferritin) and coagulation outnumber COVID-19-related stroke cases [16,23,32,36,43,44,45,46,47]. As a result, endotheliitis caused by direct viral invasion and inflammation caused by cytokine storm may be the COVID-19-peculiar mechanisms underlying such anomalies [48,49]. Serious infections, such as influenza, sepsis, and minor respiratory and urinary tract infections, have been linked to an increase in inflammation and subsequent thrombosis, which can lead to an acute stroke. However, preliminary data show that, when compared to influenza, COVID-19 is linked to a 7.6 percent increased risk of ischemic stroke [50]. Furthermore, because extremely elevated D-dimer levels (a marker of clot turnover) have been confirmed in a significant number of patients within the first few weeks of disease, especially in more severely affected individuals; a hypercoagulable state is highly anticipated in COVID-19 patients [3,7]. However, recent studies have found D-dimer levels are only slightly increased in COVID-19 patients, especially when compared to septic patients [51]. Although the presence of D-dimer suggests fibrinolytic pathways are intact and actively dissolving (lysing) fibrin, the discovery of fibrin deposits in lungs and other organs suggests dysregulation of the balance in fibrin forming (i.e., thrombin generation) and fibrin-dissolving (i.e., plasmin generation) pathways is a major aspect of COVID-19 pathogenesis [51]. Certain ischemic stroke patients had significantly higher D-dimer levels, and aggressive thrombosis was observed [52]. Furthermore, compared to non-COVID stroke patients, COVID-19 patients may have a higher rate of early re-occlusion after mechanical thrombectomy due to underlying hypercoagulability [45]. Thrombotic risk is likely to appear in COVID patients, according to preliminary reports, because anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid, and beta-2 glycoprotein-1 antibodies have been linked to COVID-related stroke [53]. Very recently, it was shown that NETs can be found in brain tissue from ischemic stroke patients and that NETs contribute to ischemic stroke brain damage, showing the pathological role of NETs in the acute setting of ischemic stroke and their contribution to long-term results [54]. Several papers reported that neutrophils are primed to make NETs in the setting of COVID and contribute to immunothrombosis in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome [55,56,57,58]. Results support the hypothesis that NETs may represent drivers of severe pulmonary complications of COVID-19, may explain the prothrombotic clinical presentations in COVID-19, and suggest that NET-targeting approaches could be considered for the treatment of uncontrolled tissue-damaging and thrombotic responses in COVID-19 [55,58]. Furthermore, antiphospholipid antibodies seem to play a key role in this process. Therefore, an interesting hypothesis is that COVID-19 exacerbates the neutrophil-like response contributing to worse stroke outcomes [59]. Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome form durable autoantibodies to phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins, such as prothrombin and β2 glycoprotein I (β2GPI). These autoantibodies engage cell surfaces, where they activate endothelial cells, platelets, and neutrophils, thereby tipping the blood endothelium interface toward thrombosis [59]. Higher titers of phospholipid-binding proteins were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity, including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), higher platelet counts, more severe respiratory disease, and lower clinical estimated glomerular filtration rate [59]. SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been linked to arrhythmia, heart failure, and myocardial infarction, all of which can lead to a cardioembolic stroke [60]. In line with this, COVID-19-related coagulopathy has been linked to spontaneous intraparenchymal and cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage, suggesting that anticoagulants may be a promising treatment option for such patients [26,37]. Furthermore, COVID-19 ECMO patients have an increased risk of ischemic stroke and infrequent intracranial hemorrhage due to air embolism [61]. This points to a complicated relationship between traditional risk factors, COVID-19 infection, and stroke and raises concerns about relatively younger patients who suffer a stroke during the ongoing pandemic. In contrast, the underlying cause-and-effect relationship remains unknown [62,63].",
            "COVID-19-related neurologic complications are caused by a variety of mechanisms that are multifactorial. Neurologic symptoms can develop because of both the virus’s direct effects and the body’s systemic response to infection [15]. Strokes in patients with COVID-19 may be due to usual causes such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. It seems likely that these COVID-19-related mechanisms would also increase the risk of stroke in infected persons who harbor the more conventional stroke risk factors [49]. The three main mechanisms appear to be responsible for the occurrence of ischemic strokes in COVID-19 are hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, and cardiomyopathy. While the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic strokes in the setting of COVID-19 has not been fully elucidated, it is possible that the affinity of the SARSCoV-2 for ACE2 receptors, which are expressed in endothelial and arterial smooth muscle cells in the brain, allows the virus to damage intracranial arteries, causing vessel wall rupture [64]. Direct viral invasion in the nervous system, neurologic injury from systemic dysfunction, RAAS dysfunction, and immune dysfunction are the distinct pathomechanics that lead to neuropathogenesis in COVID-stroke patients. Hypoxemia, which is common in COVID-19 patients, is likely to aggravate vascular and metabolic abnormalities in the brain, eventually leading to ischemic insult. Few autopsy studies have found evidence of direct viral invasion of the nervous system, but the severity of neuropathological findings has nothing to do with these findings [65,66]. However, due to the scarcity of evidence, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 directly infects the cerebral vessels. Aside from that, a few postmortem studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can directly invade endothelial cells via plausible pulmonary, cardiac, renal, liver, and bowel endotheliitis and is associated with inflammation and apoptosis [67,68]. However, this remains debatable given that viral particles seen in electron microscopy of kidney vessel endothelium may have been normal structures or artefacts [69,70]. Recently, Hottz et al. [71] identified a subset of inflammatory monocytes presenting high CD16 and low HLA-DR expression as the subset mainly interacting with platelets during severe COVID-19. Although no pathological tests were performed, some case reports suggested that multifocal ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions could be associated with endothelial implication, microthrombosis, or vasculitis in small vessels [72,73]. Another important pathophysiological mechanism of COVID-19 infection is maladaptive activity of the RAAS system. The membrane-bound protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 allows SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells (ACE2). ACE2 converts angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1–7), a vasodilator with antiproliferative, antifibrotic, and antihypertensive properties [74,75]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus may cause secondary cardiomyopathies and cerebrovascular effects by binding to ACE2. A cytokine storm-mediated systemic immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is a critical mechanism for COVID-19-related clinical manifestations [76,77]. TNF-, IL-2, IL-6, IL1B, IL7, IL10, IFN-, GCSF, CXCL10, CCL2, ferritin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, leukocytosis, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are significantly higher in critically ill COVID-19 patients [78,79,80]. For the majority of these cytokines and chemokines, including those that are typically associated with macrophage activation syndrome (IL-6, IL-18, IFN-γ, TNF-α, CXCL9), the increase was less pronounced in COVID-19 critical condition than in macrophage activation syndrome patients [81]. On the other hand, some markers (i.e., IL-5, IL-7, IL-17A, CXCL8, and VEGF) were increased in critical COVID-19 patients only and not in macrophage activation syndrome [81]. Proinflammatory cytokine levels in the blood can cause confusion and alter consciousness as well as “thromboinflammation”, which raises the risk of stroke and other thrombotic events [82,83,84,85]. Furthermore, complement activation in patients with severe COVID-19 can result in thrombotic microvascular injury [86,87,88]. Besides, pro-inflammatory cytokine release may activate microglia, resulting in cerebral insult [87]. While several COVID-19-related stroke mechanisms have been proposed, one important mechanism appears to be host immune response or virus-related thrombophilia, as evidenced by elevated markers of hypercoagulability and inflammation [83] (Figure 1). COVID-19-endotheliitis could explain the systemic impaired microcirculatory function in different vascular beds and the related clinical complications [89]. Relevant to this, recent autoptic studies of COVID-19 patients have shown the presence of fibrin thrombi within distended small vessels and capillaries along with extensive extracellular fibrin deposition [90].",
            "It is well-reported that COVID-19 affects the CNS in a variety of ways, and its neurological manifestations vary from individual infected [91]. COVID-19, according to new research, hijacks immune cells’ mitochondria, replicates within mitochondrial structures, and affects mitochondrial dynamics, causing cell death. COVID-19-infected cells’ mitochondria are extremely vulnerable, and this vulnerability increases with age. Mitochondria were first studied for their bioenergetic role, but they are now known to have a part in a wide range of cellular processes and signaling events. Viruses can take advantage of mitochondrial fission and fusion during host infection [92]. Fission and fusion are the vital processes of mitochondrial cell survival by producing balanced ROS production. Infected mitochondria with SARS-CoV-19 infection induce an excessive amount of ROS by increased fusion activity. which leads to too much iron storage, impaired mitophagy, and platelet apoptosis (Figure 2). This SARS-CoV-2-affected mitochondria serves as double membrane vesicle for viral entry [2]. From the initial stages of cerebral artery occlusion through the late stages of recovery, the inflammatory process plays a role in the ischemic cascade [2,5,93]. The inflammatory response encompasses both innate and adaptive immune-cell responses, possibly opening the door to novel treatment approaches [94]. The mitochondria are the center of oxidative equilibrium in the cell. A growing body of evidence links COVID-19 patients’ disease progression to a hyper-inflammatory state known as the “cytokine storm”, which involves major systemic perturbations, such as iron dysregulation manifested as hyperferritinemia linked to disease severity, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress [95]. The increased inflammatory/oxidative state may cause mitochondrial malfunction, which might result in platelet damage and death. Furthermore, mitochondrial oxidative stress may contribute to microbial dysbiosis by changing coagulation pathways and fueling the inflammatory/oxidative response, thus perpetuating the vicious cycle [77].",
            "During the pandemic, all patients with suspected stroke should have COVID-19 tested at the time of admission [96]. This recommendation is based on the fact that many stroke patients can test positive for COVID-19 despite the absence of systemic infection and clinical symptoms. When systemic COVID-19 symptoms are detected early, patients who test positively can be isolated appropriately. Given that traditional vascular risk factors and typical stroke pathophysiologic mechanisms are linked to the stroke frequency in COVID-19, the initial diagnostic approach should be the same as that used for all patients with suspected stroke. A hypercoagulability test, for example, is used to confirm stroke, and a similar approach should be used for COVID-19 patients with an unknown or defined underlying mechanism of stroke. Brain and neurovascular imaging as well as cardiac evaluation should be used to identify the underlying stroke mechanism, and treatment should be tailored to the identified mechanism. For all COVID-19 patients, regular tests include a complete blood count (CBC), platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, and D-dimer. However, the risks of arterial and venous thrombosis as well as central nervous system lesions must be evaluated in order to reduce the negative effects and death of COVID-19 victims [97].",
            "The specific stroke treatment, along with infection control precautions, is recommended for the management of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 [98,99,100]. Thrombolytics, anticoagulants, anti-inflammatory therapy, antivirals, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers are among the potential treatments for COVID-19-related stroke patients (ARBs). Because of the risk of bleeding, the FDA-approved intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; alteplase) is primarily used in the early stages of stroke, as the patient becomes ineligible for tPA administration after 4.5 h. There are no obvious safety concerns with tPA in specific COVID-stroke patients, necessitating appropriate evaluation for thrombolytics as well as mechanical thrombectomy in such a comorbid setting [30,101]. Mechanical thrombectomy, on the other hand, has produced conflicting results in small cohort studies of COVID-19 and acute large vessel occlusion patients [16,45]. Consistent with this, COVID-19 patients may be at increased risk of re-occlusion after initial recanalization, possibly due to infectious hypercoagulability. Given the high thrombotic risk seen in COVID-19 patients, it is reasonable to begin anticoagulants as soon as possible in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-stroke, provided the bleeding risk is tolerable. Heparin and warfarin anticoagulants, which target multiple clotting factors, may be more effective than direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which target a single clotting factor. More evidence will be provided by larger studies [67]. However, before deciding on antithrombotic therapy, the severity of the disease, the presence of other impending thrombotic events, and the risk of bleeding should all be considered. Anti-inflammatory therapies (Tocilizumab, IL-B antagonists) are primarily concerned with the delayed elimination of the virus, which increases the risk of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients. Anecdotal evidence suggests that corticosteroids could be used to treat COVID-19 complications; however, the role of anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids in stroke is debatable. Furthermore, the first FDA-approved antiviral drug for SARS-CoV-2, Remedesvir, has no reported role in stroke [61]. COVID patients are typically prescribed ACE inhibitors or ARBs, but these medications should be stopped if they develop co-morbidities, such as hypotension or acute kidney injury, or are in the acute phase of an ischemic stroke. Although it has been suggested that COVID-19 patients who receive these agents are more likely to experience adverse side effects, observational studies have not supported this. As with any stroke patient, long-term treatment of vascular risk factors and an adequate amount of antithrombotic should be initiated for secondary stroke prevention. Finally, the increased risk of intravascular blood coagulation associated with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to stroke, which has proven to be a significant complication impeding COVID-19 management. Clinicians managing patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic should monitor these patients for potential late complications, as delayed diagnosis can lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality, as frequently reported [102,103].",
            "According to observational studies, stroke associated with COVID-19, which causes a high rate of death and disability following ischemic stroke, is more serious than stroke without COVID-19 [104,105]. In addition, limited data show that Afro-Americans have higher mortality rates and poorer predictions of acute stroke associated with COVID-19 than other races [106]. Stroke can, however, be caused by ageing, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, or other vascular risk factors. COVID-19-induced hypoxia, hypercoagulation, and a pro-inflammatory state contribute to the occurrence, progression, and prognosis of COVID-19-related stroke [107,108]. Critically ill patients present several additional risk factors for nervous system damage. Reasons for these include deep sedation and extended muscular paralysis, bed rest for several days, and the inability to receive proper physical rehabilitation [48,49,109].",
            "Acute cerebral stroke is still a potentially fatal and disabling illness, and patients who test positively for COVID-19 should seek immediate medical attention as well as optimal medical care, which has been shown to improve stroke outcomes. Universal precautions should be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection. Patients with cerebrovascular disease should keep an extra supply of medications on hand in case of a home quarantine or a disruption in supply chains. A highly safe and efficient telehealth visit is frequently performed in patients suffering from transient ischemic attack (TIA) for rapid ambulatory evaluation and in secondary prevention and rehabilitation of stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic [110,111,112,113,114,115]. However, the increased risk of stroke in the COVID-19 setting may result in a COVID-19-related widespread stroke epidemic, necessitating critical care measures to prevent a stroke epidemic in people with COVID-19 disease [97,105]. Platelets represent a potential therapeutic target for improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Recent trials in which thromboprophylaxis was assessed for COVID-19 patients showed in noncritically ill patients with COVID-19, an initial strategy of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin increased the probability of survival to hospital discharge compared with usual-care thromboprophylaxis [116], whereas in critically ill patients with COVID-19, an initial strategy of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin did not result in a greater probability of survival to hospital discharge or a greater number of days free of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support than did usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis [117]. Berger et al. [118] evaluated the benefits and risks of adding a P2Y12 inhibitor to anticoagulant therapy among non-critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19, reporting no increased odds of improvement in organ-support-free days within 21 days during hospitalization. Similarly, Chow et al. [119] in their study of adults hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 showed that early aspirin use was associated with lower odds of 28-day in-hospital mortality. Further randomized clinical trials that include diverse patients with different COVID-19 clinical condition are warranted to adequately evaluate heparin and aspirin’s efficacy in patients with different risk conditions.",
            "Stroke is an iniquitous SARS-CoV-2-linked neurovascular complication. Stroke has been associated with age, co-morbidities, and serious diseases in COVID-19 subjects. Although stroke is a rare complication of COVID-19, when it occurs, it frequently causes considerable morbidity and mortality. The coagulation factors and respiratory issues lead to the risk factors of stroke, i.e., hypoxic brain dead and associated neurodegeneration. The key to the minimum mortality and morbidity of patients with acute stroke is timely evaluation and hyperacute treatment. Stroke is a common neurovascular complication of SARS-CoV-2. Stroke has been linked to age, co-morbidities, and serious diseases in COVID-19 subjects. Even though stroke is a rare complication of COVID-19, it frequently results in significant morbidity and mortality. Coagulation issues and respiratory problems are risk factors for stroke, which results in hypoxic brain death and neurodegeneration. Timely evaluation and hyperacute treatment are critical in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients suffering from an acute stroke. During the current pandemic, medical teams should be aware of a wide range of COVID-19 neurological manifestations and ensure adequate isolation and protection for any suspected patients. It is critical to collect comparative data on stroke phenotypes, treatment details, and actual outcomes in patients with and without COVID-19 to better understand these emerging co-existing phenomena.",

            "Schematic illustration of pathomechanisms related to COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-linked stroke. (A) The mechanism by which the SARS-CoV-2 enters cells is depicted. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the main protein, interacts with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, allowing the virus to enter the cell. A difference in ACE2 levels may make people more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. (B) An inflammatory state in the pulmonary alveoli, which leads to pulmonary tissue edema and, eventually, systemic involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines. (C) Thrombotic complication (stroke) caused by COVID-19 infection. Microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis complications result from anticipated intravascular thrombosis, including cerebral insult and stroke [67]. As a result of potent local and systemic cytokine production, platelets become activated and interact with neutrophils, enhancing the process of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)osis. As a result, it may increase thrombin production and fibrin deposition. Excess fibrin deposition and fibrinolysis shutdown result in intravascular thrombosis and hypercoagulability, which eventually lead to clinical thromboembolic stroke complication. As a result, inflammatory and hypercoagulability markers are elevated in infected individuals, assisting in prognosis and diagnosis. Thrombolytics, anticoagulants, anti-inflammatory therapy, antivirals, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers are among the potential therapies used to treat COVID-19 and COVID-19-associated stroke (ARBs).",

It depicts the pathogenic signaling pathways in the cerebral ischemia cascade that are involved in mitochondrial function and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The downstream signaling pathways of glutamate excitotoxicity caused by ischemic stroke are depicted schematically. Excessive Ca2+ influx induces mitochondrial malfunction and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to pathological processes as mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis, mitochondrial fission and fusion, mitophagy, DNA damage response, and inflammatory responses. A cytokine storm leads to platelet dysfunction, whose association with microglia activation, caused by mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production, can cause ischemic stroke."

            "The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory system coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has created significant challenges for scientists seeking to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify the best therapies for infected patients. Although ACE2 is a known receptor for the virus and has been shown to mediate viral entry into the lungs, accumulating reports highlight the presence of neurological symptoms resulting from infection. As ACE2 expression is low in the central nervous system (CNS), these neurological symptoms are unlikely to be caused by ACE2-virus binding. In this review, we will discuss a proposed interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in the CNS. TLR2 is an innate immune receptor that recognizes exogenous microbial components but has also been shown to interact with multiple viral components, including the envelope (E) protein of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, TLR2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Based on these observations, we hypothesize that TLR2 may play a critical role in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infiltration in the CNS, thereby resulting in the induction or acceleration of AD and PD pathologies in patients.",
            "Interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a membrane protein in the central nervous system (CNS) that recognizes foreign substances is implicated in causing some of the neurological symptoms of COVID-19. Toll-like receptor 2 protein (TLR2) binds to components of microbes, including specific parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as part of its role in natural immunity. It is widely present in many brain cells and is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Changyoun Kim, Eliezer Masliah and colleagues at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, USA, review the emerging evidence suggesting TLR2 plays a critical role in the response to SARS-CoV-2 virus infiltration into the CNS, inducing or accelerating neurological degeneration. Deeper understanding of the link could help develop new treatments for the neurological symptoms of COVID-19.",
            "The coronavirus pandemic, which is caused by severe acute respiratory system coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in the infection of over 326 million people, with more than 5.5 million deaths due to the disease1. The disease is considered to be primarily respiratory, with the most common symptoms including cough, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and a loss of taste and/or smell, among others2. The symptoms that are centralized in the lungs present due to the damage to the alveolar tissue caused by the virus, specifically, the resulting pneumonia, which coincides with inflammation3. These symptoms are associated with the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the lungs, which is known as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and modulates the cellular entry of the virus. The spike (S) proteins of coronaviruses are known to bind to ACE2, and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be more infectious than earlier coronaviruses since its binding affinity for ACE2 is higher4.",
            "As the pandemic continues, increasing evidence has drawn attention to the various local and systemic inflammatory effects of the virus, such as cytokine storms5. These inflammatory effects allow the transition of focus from localized damage in the lungs to systemic damage in the body, specifically in the central nervous system (CNS), where the virus was shown to produce pathologies resembling various “classic” forms of neurodegeneration6. It has been noted that patients with dementia have an increased risk of contracting the virus, and it has also been suggested that those who contracted the virus had pathological symptoms that resembled those of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD)7–9.",
            "AD and PD are the most common neurodegenerative disorders, with ~6 and 1 million people, respectively, having the conditions in the United States alone in 2021, with both values expected to increase in the future as the average age increases10,11. In AD, the cognitive deficits are caused by abnormal accumulations of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and tau protein, called Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively, which are considered the pathological hallmarks12. PD is a progressive neurological movement disorder13. Common symptoms of PD include tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, but nonmotor symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, also occur13. PD is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and the pathological hallmarks are the abnormal deposition of misfolded proteins called Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs), which are primarily composed of α-synuclein (α-syn)13,14.",
            "Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) belongs to a family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and is expressed on the surface of numerous cells, including innate immune cells15. TLR2 recognizes a variety of microbial components, such as lipopeptides and peptidoglycan15. While TLR2 plays an important role in the innate immune system, it has been demonstrated that TLR2 also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and PD16–20. Therefore, TLR2 has been proposed as a new therapeutic target for these diseases18,19,21.",
            "In addition to being a systemic respiratory disease, infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces neuropathology in patients22–26. Although recent studies have reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS26,27, it is still under debate whether SARS-CoV-2 can infect cells in the CNS28. Despite the controversy, accumulating evidence supports the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS in patients, which could possibly induce further delayed neurological complications28. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that there could be a receptor that might recognize a component of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain, such as TLR2. TLR2 has been known to interact with bacterial pathogens, and recent studies have demonstrated that TLR2 can also detect various viruses, including SARS-CoV-229–32. In addition, TLR2 is widely expressed in brain resident cells, such as neurons and glial cells33,34. Therefore, in this review, we speculate that a pathogenic interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TLR2 occurs in the CNS, and we will examine its potential effects on AD and PD pathology.",
            "The paraffin-embedded brain sections of control and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were kindly provided by Dr. Avindra Nath (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke). The procedure for immunochemical analysis has been described elsewhere35,36. Briefly, blinded brain sections were incubated with anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA-1, citrate buffer treatment, 1:2000, Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA), anti-transmembrane protein 119 (TMEM119, citrate buffer treatment, 1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3, citrate buffer treatment, 1:2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), or anti-phospho-α-synuclein (S129) (81 A, citrate buffer treatment, 1:10,000, gift from Drs. Virginia Lee and John Trojanowski, University of Pennsylvania, PA) at 4 °C overnight. The next day, the sections were incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody and detected with an avidin D-HRP detection system (ABC elite, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The immunostained sections were imaged by an Olympus BX41 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).",
            "There is increasing evidence that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have neurological symptoms along with respiratory symptoms37,38. Approximately 36% of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have neurological symptoms39. The common neurological symptoms of patients include headaches and nausea, but patients can also present with more severe neurological disorders, such as meningo-encephalitis and acute cerebrovascular disease22–26. Neuropathologies of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients are varied, but common neuroinflammatory findings have been reported, including astrogliosis, microgliosis, ischemia, hemorrhage, and microvascular lesions in the CNS of patients40. Similar to previous studies, our postmortem analysis revealed the activation of microglia in the patients’ brains (Fig. 1). Whether T cells infiltrate the CNS is controversial;41,42 however, a recent study suggested that subpopulations of CD3+ and CD4+ T cells infiltrate the CNS and interact with resident microglial cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients43. Our postmortem study also detected a small number of infiltrated CD3+ T cells in the cortex of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Representative immunohistochemical analysis of innate and adaptive immune cells in the frontal cortex of control and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.White matter sections obtained from one control and two SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were immunostained with anti-IBA-1 and anti-TMEM119 for microglia and anti-CD3 for T cells.

            "Although the expression of ACE2 is very limited in the CNS and the amount of SARS-CoV-2 present in the CNS after infection is still disputed14,26, postmortem studies have identified the existence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS of patients44. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS was initially hypothesized due to anosmia that presented as a common symptom of the infection45. This led to the speculation of the olfactory bulb as a potential route of entry for the virus into the brain46. Meinhardt et al. suggested that the neural-mucosal interface could be a potential route for SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion (Fig. 2)46. However, the study also demonstrated the presence of the virus in other brain regions that had no direct connection to this interface, leading them to suggest the existence of other routes for SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion46. There are four other potential CNS entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, although none have been proven (Fig. 2). Armocida and colleagues proposed that the virus could infect neurons in the peripheral nervous system and then take advantage of axonal transport to gain access to the CNS47. McQuaid et al. suggested the lateral ventricles and choroid plexus as a CNS entry mechanism for SARS-CoV-248. Since these regions contain epithelial cells, which express ACE2, it has been suggested that the virus could cross the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and enter the choroid plexus and ventricular system. Recent studies demonstrated that the expression of ACE2 is relatively high in the corneal epithelium and suggested that ocular conjunctival inoculation was enough to cause COVID-1949,50. In addition, various sampling studies identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA within regions of the visual system, such as the retina, optic nerve, conjunctiva, and vitreous body, in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses51,52. A recent study revealed that the S protein of the novel coronavirus can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB)53. Therefore, it has also been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could impair the functional integrity of the BBB54,55.Fig. 2Potential entry routes for SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system (CNS).SARS-CoV-2 can infiltrate the CNS via the penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in the epithelium of the choroid plexus, the corneal epithelium of the eye, the olfactory epithelium of the olfactory bulb (nasal route), and the peripheral nervous system, including the mucosal epithelium, enterocytes, and smooth muscle cells.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 can infiltrate the CNS via the penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in the epithelium of the choroid plexus, the corneal epithelium of the eye, the olfactory epithelium of the olfactory bulb (nasal route), and the peripheral nervous system, including the mucosal epithelium, enterocytes, and smooth muscle cells.",
            "A recent clinical study found that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for patients with dementia was increased 2–3-fold compared with cognitively healthy individuals8. In addition, the levels of total tau, phosphorylated tau181, and glial fibrillary acidic protein, all biomarkers for AD, were elevated in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with severe symptoms, suggesting a potential correlation between AD and SARS-CoV-2 infection severity56. Transcriptomic and interactomic data also showed a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and β-amyloid production and clearance, leading to the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 infection may exacerbate AD neuropathology57. In addition, patients with the homozygous allele apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), an AD-associated gene, showed an increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and APOE4 may also affect the severity of the host response to infection58,59. Furthermore, it was found that SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with AD had a higher rate of death due to the disease than SARS-CoV-2-infected patients without AD60.",
            "In addition to viral infection, the characteristic behaviors of AD patients may increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity. First, patients may not be able to follow the recommendations from public health providers to reduce the spread of the virus61. Second, the lack of social interaction due to the pandemic may increase mental and psychological stress in AD patients62. Increased psychological stress further accelerates the deterioration of cognitive function in AD patients62.",
            "ACE2 is a known receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and its role in AD has been extensively studied during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; however, its role in AD is controversial63. A recent study found an inverse correlation between ACE2 activity and AD patient neuropathology, such as the accumulation of Aβ and phosphorylated tau64. In addition, Kehoe and colleagues reported a reduction in ACE2 activity in the brain homogenate of AD patients carrying the APOE4 allele64. However, Lim and colleagues showed an increased level of ACE2 in the brain tissue of AD patients65. Zhao and colleagues found that ACE2 expression was upregulated in the occipital and temporal lobes and the hippocampal CA1 region in AD patients compared to healthy controls66. Therefore, further studies are required to evaluate the role of ACE2 in AD pathogenesis.",
            "To date, the risk factor associating PD with SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been clearly identified67. However, it has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger parkinsonism symptoms in healthy individuals68. A case study by Lee and colleagues suggested the potential effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the dopaminergic mechanisms that led to the development of dysphagia in PD patients69. In addition, a recent study reported that infection with SARS-CoV-2 may worsen the symptoms of PD70. It was demonstrated that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 sped up the process of α-syn aggregation in vitro71.",
            "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has also increased the level of psychological stress in PD patients72 which may worsen the symptoms of PD. For example, the accumulation of psychological stress has been shown to cause the temporary aggravation of motor symptoms73,74. One observational study found that 40% of PD patients showed an exacerbation of their motor symptoms during the pandemic75. In addition, the limitation of physical exercise increases psychological stress72.",
            "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) belong to a family of innate immune receptors known as PRRs15. To date, 10 human (TLR1-10) and 13 murine (1-13) subtypes of TLRs have been identified76. TLRs are type I transmembrane proteins and have a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain77. TLRs are abundantly expressed in multiple peripheral organs but are also expressed in the neuronal and nonneuronal cells of the CNS78. TLRs can recognize both exogenous pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)79. TLRs form a homo-/heterodimer to recognize different shapes of pathogens80. For example, the TLR4 homodimer recognizes the lipopolysaccharide of gram-negative bacteria, and the TLR3 homodimer recognizes double-stranded RNA81. Once activated, TLRs trigger intracellular signaling cascades via myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88), except for TLR3, which initiates signaling via Toll/interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adaptor interferon-β (TRIF), thereby resulting in the induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines15.",
            "TLR2 is an innate immune receptor, but increasing evidence demonstrates its role in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and PD18,82. Recent genetic studies identified TLR2 as a risk factor for late-onset AD (LOAD) in Han Chinese and Azeri Turk ancestry populations83,84. While genetic association studies of TLR2 with AD are still open to debate76, accumulating in vitro and in vivo studies provide evidence for the pathogenic role of TLR2 in AD.",
            "In microglia, the brain resident innate immune cells, TLR2 mediates fibrillar Aβ-induced immune responses85. In addition, the activation of TLR2 enhances pathogenic Aβ uptake in microglia86. On the other hand, genetic depletion of TLR2 reduces the Aβ42-induced immune response and enhances Aβ clearance in cultured microglia16,82. In an animal model of AD (APP/PS1 mice), functional inhibition of TLR2 decreases microgliosis, astrogliosis, Aβ plaque deposition, and phosphorylated tau accumulation in the brain regions, thereby improving cognitive function19,87,88. In addition, genetic depletion of TLR2 shows protective effects against memory and cognitive impairments in an AD mouse model89,90. The expression of TLR2 is increased in AD patients and animal models91,92. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrates that the localization of microglial TLR2 is associated with Aβ plaques in the brains of AD patients and aged mouse models82,85,93.",
            "Although the pathogenic role of TLR2 in PD was demonstrated a few years later than that in AD, it has also been extensively studied for this short period18. Genetic associations of TLR2 polymorphisms with PD were identified in northeastern Han Chinese and Greek populations94,95. In 2013, we first demonstrated that neuron-released oligomeric forms of α-syn activated microglial TLR2, thereby inducing neurotoxic inflammation through the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)17,96. This finding was supported by subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies. Roodveldt et al. demonstrated that pretreatment with a TLR2 agonist, but not other TLR agonists, increased microglial susceptibility against α-syn97. Qiao et al. showed that functional and genetic inhibition of TLR2 prevented microglial responses against neuron-released α-syn98. Daniele et al. reported that α-syn treatment induced microglial inflammatory responses by forming a TLR1/2 heterodimer complex99. We also demonstrated that leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a PD-associated gene, and nuclear factor of activated T cell 1 (NFAT1) are downstream signaling molecules of TLR2 in microglia, thereby modulating neurotoxic microglial activation100. In a mouse model of PD, Drouin-Ouellet et al. reported that the overexpression of α-syn increased the expression of TLR2101. La Viola et al. demonstrated that oligomeric forms of α-syn induced memory impairment through TLR2102. Interestingly, exercise showed a protective effect in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model via the downregulation of TLR2 and downstream signaling molecules, including MyD88103. In PD patients, the level of TLR2 was elevated in the blood compared to healthy controls101. Furthermore, the expression of TLR2 was also increased in the specific brain regions of PD patients and aged animal models in accordance with disease stages91,101.",
            "Although TLR2 is primarily expressed in innate immune cells, recent studies have demonstrated that neurons also express TLR281,104, which has been demonstrated to play an important role in PD. We demonstrated that the activation of neuronal TLR2 impaired autophagy through the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling cascade, thereby inducing the accumulation of neurotoxic α-syn aggregates105. These findings were supported by Dzamko and colleagues, who also demonstrated the elevation of neuronal TLR2 in the brains of PD patients106.",
            "The neuron-to-neuron and neuron-to-glial transmission of α-syn has been proposed to play a central role in PD pathogenesis and disease progression107. Although the primary role of TLR2 is recognizing pathogens, TLR2 also modulates pathogen phagocytosis in cells108. Genetic or pharmacological activation of TLR2 increased extracellular α-syn uptake by neuronal and glial cells, while it was inhibited by genetic and functional depletion of TLR217,21,105. Specifically, the α-syn transmission assay indicated that the activation of TLR2 not only increased α-syn transmission in neurons but also increased its propagation21. In microglia, the internalization of monomeric α-syn was not affected by TLR2, but the uptake of α-syn oligomer was significantly decreased by TLR2 inhibition in the cells17. In addition, the deposition of α-syn increased in astrocytes that did not express α-syn in either PD patients or mouse models21. These observations were reproduced in PD models in which functional inhibition of TLR2 significantly reduced astroglial α-syn deposition in both a PD mouse model and a neuron-to-astrocyte α-syn monitoring system21.",
            "Given that TLR2 plays an important role in PD, targeting TLR2 has been proposed as a promising immunotherapeutic option for the disease18. Indeed, the administration of a TLR2 functional blocking antibody improved α-syn neuropathology, neuroinflammation, and motor behavioral deficits in a PD mouse model21.",
            "Lipopeptides and gram-positive bacteria-derived lipoprotein are considered the traditional ligands of TLR215. However, increasing evidence also supports the interaction of TLR2 with viruses. Varicella-zoster virus activates the inflammatory response in monocytes via TLR2109. Furthermore, various viral proteins, such as the structural proteins (p17, p24, and gp41) of human immunodeficiency virus 1, the core protein of hepatitis C virus, and glycoprotein B of herpes simplex virus 1, have been known to interact with TLR2, thereby inducing cytokine gene expression110. In addition, it was found that the S protein of SARS-CoV-1 activated TLR2 in peripheral leukocytes, which resulted in the induction of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine gene expression, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF-α111.",
            "The exact pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is still largely unknown. However, increasing evidence supports that TLRs might play a role during SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis112. It has been shown that the surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 could behave as a PAMP, thereby inducing the upregulation of inflammatory factors in the rodent model through TLR2 and TLR4113. Prophylactic administration of a TLR2 agonist showed a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and decreased virus transmission through the activation of the innate immune system114. More importantly, Zheng et al. demonstrated that TLR2 can sense the envelope (E) protein of SARS-CoV-2, thereby inducing an inflammatory response30. Signaling molecules downstream from TLR2, including MyD88 and TRIF, were significantly increased in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with severe/critical conditions compared to healthy controls. In addition, a pharmacological inhibitor of TLR2 inhibited the inflammatory responses of human leukocytes against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, genetic depletion of TLR2 prevented inflammation and tissue damage in the lungs of mice expressing human ACE2. These findings suggest that the surface proteins of SARS-CoV-2 induce the activation of TLR2, leading to inflammatory responses.",
            "ACE2 is a primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2. After infection, the number of SARS-CoV-2-positive cells rapidly increases in the host peripheral system115. However, the viral load in the CNS is lower than that in the periphery26. Based on these observations, we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited in the CNS during the early infection period for two reasons: the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 CNS infiltration by the existence of a physical barrier (the BBB) and the low level of SARS-CoV-2 high-affinity receptors in the CNS116. However, persistent infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to excessive peripheral immune responses, which could induce damage to the BBB117. Therefore, a greater number of viruses can infiltrate the CNS via the damaged barriers, which may increase the chance that a viral component will meet a responding receptor, such as TLR2, in the CNS (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Potential interaction mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and TLR2 in AD and PD.E protein of brain-infiltrated SARS-CoV-2 induces microglial TLR2, thereby increasing the susceptibility of TLR2 to α-syn and Aβ oligomers. The activation of microglial TLR2 by the E protein of SARS-CoV-2, α-syn, or Aβ increases the release of neurotoxic, proinflammatory cytokines, which may also induce vascular degeneration in the brain, thereby increasing SARS-CoV-2 infiltration into the CNS. In neurons, the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 may activate neuronal TLR2, which impairs neuronal autophagic processes, resulting in an accumulation of neurotoxic α-syn aggregates.",
            "E protein of brain-infiltrated SARS-CoV-2 induces microglial TLR2, thereby increasing the susceptibility of TLR2 to α-syn and Aβ oligomers.

            "Many of the severe and critical conditions of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients result in death115. However, vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 will help reduce the numbers of patients who become severely or critically ill. In addition, developing a medication for COVID-19 would reduce the death rate of patients in the future. To date, two treatments have been approved by the FDA: an antibody cocktail targeting SARS-CoV-2 (REGN-COV2, REGENERON) and an oral antiviral medicine (Molnupiravir, Merck). On the other hand, CNS-infiltrated viruses might survive longer than those in the peripheral system due to the lack of an adaptive immune system and the high selectivity of the BBB against drugs117. Therefore, this prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS may cause further problems in the brain that might not present until much later. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 viral components may directly affect patients with neurodegenerative diseases. According to Zheng et al., the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 is activated and induces TLR2 expression in innate immune cells30. Microglia, brain resident innate immune cells, express TLR2, which plays a critical role in the neuroinflammation of AD and PD patients17,85. Therefore, we speculate that the viral components, especially the E protein, of brain-infiltrated SARS-CoV-2 induces the activation of microglial TLR2, thereby increasing the susceptibility of TLR2 to Aβ and α-syn deposition in patients (Fig. 3). The chronic activation of TLR2 can induce chronic neuroinflammation, which will accelerate disease pathogenesis118. TLR2 is also expressed in neurons, and prolonged infection with SARS-CoV-2 may induce neuronal TLR2 activation in the brain. The induction of neuronal TLR2 is associated with pathological α-syn neuron-to-neuron transmission and propagation, which is known to be associated with disease progression18. In addition, the activation of neuronal TLR2 has been shown to impair neuronal autophagy, thereby increasing abnormal accumulation of neurotoxic misfolded proteins, such as α-syn105. Therefore, the induction of neuronal TLR2 susceptibility by the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 may lead to the deposition of abnormal protein in the cells, thereby affecting the disease onset and/or accelerating the disease progression of proteinopathy-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, our preliminary postmortem analysis revealed that the accumulation of phosphorylated α-syn, one of the pathogenic forms of α-syn, was increased in the brains of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (Fig. 4). For these reasons, further detailed studies are required to understand the pathogenic interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TLR2 and the potential of TLR2 as target for COVID-19 treatment.Fig. 4Representative immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated-α-syn in the frontal cortex of control and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.White matter sections obtained from one control and two SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were immunostained with anti-phospho-α-syn.

            "Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 entry into the central nervous system can result in neurological and/or neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, routes of SARS-Cov-2 entry into the brain via neuroinvasive pathways such as transcribrial, ocular surface or hematogenous system are discussed. It is argued that SARS-Cov-2-induced cytokine storm, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Further studies on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants on protein aggregation, glia or microglia activation, and blood-brain barrier are warranted.",
            "On December 12, 2019, in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, the first cases of an unexplained pneumonia failing to respond to the standard treatment regimen led to an exhaustive search for a new virus. The clinical symptoms of the condition were fever, dry cough, sore throat, pneumonia, severe dyspnea, and myalgia (Huang C. et al., 2020; Zhu N. et al., 2020). Subsequently, on February 11, 2020, the new coronavirus was identified and was termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coincidentally, a day earlier, the first draft genome of the virus was made publicly available. This enabled research groups to develop different molecular diagnostics such as RT-PCR and immunological assays. Later, CRISPR-based assays, nucleic acid microarray assays, and next generation sequencing were added (Habibzadeh et al., 2021).",
            "The World Health Organization (WHO) is responsible for declaring a pandemic. WHO monitors disease activity on a global scale through a network of centers located in countries worldwide and has a pandemic preparedness plan that consists of six phases of pandemic alert. Phase 1 represents the lowest level of alert and usually indicates that a newly emerged or previously existing virus is circulating among animals, with low risk of transmission to humans. Phase 6, the pandemic phase, is declared when an outbreak is characterized by globally widespread and sustained disease transmission among humans (Rogers, 2022). Since by the end of February 2020, COVID-19 had already registered 83,652 cases globally (Wassie et al., 2020; Carvalho et al., 2021). On March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.",
            "Patients who have concomitant comorbidities and patients admitted to the intensive care unit are significantly more likely to develop complications from COVID-19 (Sanyaolu et al., 2020). Elderly and seriously ill patients with a clinical history of cardiovascular, liver, and/or kidney disease carry the highest risk of mortality. Obesity is also a risk factor for all ages (Huang Y. et al., 2020), and age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic group, and geographical location may also influence the outcome (Harwood et al., 2022).",
            "The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family of the genus betacoronavirus (βCoV) and was identified as the etiological agent of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2, like other known coronaviruses, is an enveloped virus with single-stranded positive sense RNA and a genome approximately 29.9 kb in size (Masters, 2006; Rastogi et al., 2020). Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) both have characteristically high homologous sequence, unlike the Middle East Syndrome (MERS)-CoV virus (Yu et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 envelope is associated with four structural proteins: membrane protein (M); spike protein (S); envelope protein (E); and nucleocapsid protein (N) (Lu R. et al., 2020; Figure 1). Details on the structure and molecular biology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been recently reviewed by several groups (Arya et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021; Rahimi et al., 2021).",
            "Schematic model of the SARS-CoV-2 whit its structural proteins. (A) The virus envelope is associated with four structural proteins: membrane protein (M); spike protein (S); envelope protein (E); and nucleocapsid protein (N). Moreover, it has a single-stranded positive sense RNA and a genome approximately 29.9 kb in size. (B) To enter a host cell, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with the ACE2 and neuropilin-1, while TMPRSS2 to activate its membrane-fusion capacity and subsequent endocytosis.",
            "Analysis of mutations in the coding and non-coding regions, genetic diversity, and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 has also been carried out and based on the results it was suggested that a minimal variation in the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for a drastic change in the structures of target proteins, making available drugs ineffective (Naqvi et al., 2020). Clinical data show that the main structures of the body that are affected by COVID-19 are the respiratory and cardiovascular systems (Kapoor, 2020; Lazzeri et al., 2020; Yi et al., 2021). However, SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect other systems, such as the digestive, urogenital and nervous systems (Zhang Y. et al., 2020; Spudich and Nath, 2022). In this review, we discuss the recent reports on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in the central nervous system (CNS) and the probable impact of COVID-19 on neurodegenerative diseases.",
            "There are reports of COVID-19 exerting neurological effects, the most common being hypogeusia (diminished sense of taste) and anosmia (loss of sense of smell) (Gilani et al., 2020; Spudich and Nath, 2022), and cerebrovascular damage (Beyrouti et al., 2020; Meegada et al., 2020; Gilpin et al., 2021). However, encephalopathies (Helms et al., 2020), demyelination (Domingues et al., 2020; Zanin et al., 2020), edema and symptom presentations similar to multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barré have also been observed with COVID-19 (Toscano et al., 2020; Spudich and Nath, 2022). Other neurological/neuropsychiatric symptoms such as alterations in consciousness and hallucinations in COVID-19 have been attributed to SARS-CoV-2’s effect on the frontal lobe cortex, an area intimately involved in perception (Ellul et al., 2020; Ferrando et al., 2020; Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020).",
            "Because COVID-19 is a relatively recent disease, its full pathogenic mechanisms and possible sequelae in the nervous system remain unclear. Fortunately, novel molecular biology techniques, such as RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, CRISPR-based assays, and nucleic acid microarray assays have made it possible to elucidate some general aspects of the disease (Habibzadeh et al., 2021) and relate them to other public health emergencies caused by other coronaviruses, such as SARS in 2002–2003 and MERS in 2012 (Zhu Z. et al., 2020). Researchers have been able to ascertain complications associated with pre-existing conditions and the key role played by the immune system in resolution or further complication of the disease (de Wit et al., 2016; Abdelrahman et al., 2020; Ansariniya et al., 2021). In addition, SARS-CoV-2-induced acute and long-term neurological effects are a subject of intense investigation and a main focus of this article.",
            "Human coronaviruses not only cause common colds but can also infect neural cells as evidenced by neurotropism and neuroinvasion (Arbour et al., 2000). Studies carried out on brain samples taken from patients with SARS disease detected the presence of the SARS-CoV virus in nervous tissue (Ding et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2005). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of COVID-19 patients using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry techniques (Domingues et al., 2020; Huang Y. H. et al., 2020; Moriguchi et al., 2020; Liu J. M. et al., 2021; Serrano et al., 2021; Song et al., 2021). Although the exact mechanism of neurological complications in COVID-19 patients is unknown, it has been shown that infection with SARS-CoV-2 damages the choroid plexus epithelium, leading to leakage across the blood brain barrier (Pellegrini et al., 2020). Nonetheless, potential mechanism (s) of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the CNS are a subject of intense relevance and interest (Hu et al., 2020).",
            "It is known that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 occupy the primary receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Li et al., 2003; Lu R. et al., 2020) and can form a complex with other cofactors such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) (Hoffmann et al., 2020) and neuropilin-1 (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020; Daly et al., 2020). This interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is essential for the complex to be internalized into the cells (Figure 1). TMPRSS2 is vital for SARS-CoV-2 infection, although it has a low expression in the brain. However, SARS-CoV-2 can also infect cells via neuropilin-1 and furin protease which have a higher and broader expression in the brain compared to TMPRSS2 or ACE2 (Davies et al., 2020). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to infect glutamatergic neurons due to higher expression of ACE2, neuropilin-1 and furin protease than GABAergic neurons (Dobrindt et al., 2021). Thus, other proteins could be involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain. Indeed, a recent study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may interact with metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2), which may play a role in internalization and perhaps in SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism (Wang J. et al., 2021).",
            "ACE2 is highly expressed in adipose tissue and organs such as the kidney, small intestine, heart, and testicles, and to a lesser extent in the lung, liver, colon, spleen, muscle, blood, and brain (Li et al., 2020). Moreover, a low but constant expression of ACE2 has been revealed via the use of transcriptomic techniques on various brain structures, such as the brainstem, cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, choroid plexuses, and the paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus (Xia and Lazartigues, 2008; Chen R. et al., 2020). Given the evidence for the distribution of ACE2 in the brain, it can be inferred that multiple regions may be affected during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2 than SARS-CoV and therefore, could have a major detrimental effect on the brain (Natoli et al., 2020).",
            "The clinical severity of COVID-19 has been correlated with the frequency of neurological complications, while meningitis and encephalitis have been associated with paranasal sinusitis and could, in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, be an indicator of an aggravated viral infection due to an obstruction in the paranasal lymphatic vessels (Bridwell et al., 2020; Moriguchi et al., 2020). On the other hand, the glymphatic system, a glia-dependent elimination pathway for soluble wastes and metabolic products in the brain, is believed to play an important role in paranasal sinusitis. Serving as the brain’s “front end,” the glymphatic system is interconnected with the lymphatic network of the dura, cranial nerves, and veins of the skull (Benveniste et al., 2019). This interconnection could be used by SARS-CoV-2 to gain access to the brain in order to be internalized by the neurons. A compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the perforation of the ethmoid bone are other suggested routes via which the virus enters the brain (Zubair et al., 2020; Pacheco-Herrero et al., 2021). Overall, three main routes for viral entry to the CNS have been proposed: (1) the transcribrial neuroinvasive route; (2) the neuroinvasive route via the ocular surface; and (3) the hematogenous neuroinvasive route (Figure 2). These proposed routes are discussed in the following sections.",
            "Mechanisms suggested through which SARS-CoV-2 invades the nervous system. (A) Transcribrial neuroinvasive route; SARS-CoV-2 may invade the brain through the olfactory nerve, and via cranial nerves. (B) Route ocular surface; multiple cell types of the visual system are suggested provide as potential entry points for SARS-CoV-2 invasion to the brain. (C) Hematogenous neuroinvasive route; SARS-CoV-2 possibly infects vascular endothelial cells via the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors. Viral particles can reach the brain through the BBB by infecting and replicating inside brain microvascular endothelial cells. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause excessive peripheral immune responses to result in BBB dysfunction via cytokine storm.",
            "It has been proposed that one of the main neuroinvasive pathways into the CNS by SARS-CoV-2, as well as other viruses is via tropism, where a virus can infect a distinct group of cells by binding to the virus receptors on the surface of the host cell (Bauer et al., 2022a). In fact, chronic viral infections can be a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. In this regard, potential involvement of Japanese encephalitic virus, the influenza virus, herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in etiology of Parkinson’s disease and for Alzheimer’s disease have been suggested (De Chiara et al., 2012; Limphaibool et al., 2019; Sait et al., 2021). It is worth noting that HSV-1 infections are common, and that the virus can persist in a latent form within the neurons of its human host. Therefore, viruses may cause damage in vulnerable brain areas leading to neurodegenerative disease (Lotz et al., 2021; Sait et al., 2021).",
            "It is suggested that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the olfactory bulb via infection of the peripheral nerve terminals of the olfactory sensory neurons (Mori, 2015; Desforges et al., 2019; Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2021). This proposed transcribrial route is supported by reports of SARS-CoV-2 patients presenting symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia (Klopfenstein et al., 2020; Levinson et al., 2020; Mutiawati et al., 2021). It is noteworthy that ACE2 protein is highly expressed in the olfactory bulb (Brann et al., 2020) and the olfactory neuroepithelium (Sungnak et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020). Thus, it is postulated that SARS-CoV-2 forms complexes with TMPRSS2 and neuropilin-1 via interaction with olfactory neuroepithelial ACE2, allowing it to enter into the brain retrogradely via the cranial nerves (Reza-Zaldívar et al., 2020; Messlinger et al., 2021). Indeed, there are reports that when some viruses infect the nociceptive neurons of the nasal cavity, they are able to reach the CNS through the trigeminal nerve (Deatly et al., 1990; Lochhead and Thorne, 2012) and other sensory terminals of the vagus nerve (Driessen et al., 2016). Hence, SARS-CoV-2 could follow the cranial nerves (Bulfamante et al., 2021; Messlinger et al., 2021) from their origin in the nasal cavity to the olfactory nerve, and then to the olfactory bulb, and finally arriving at the brain stem (Bougakov et al., 2021; Figure 2A). This pathway is also followed by the OC43 coronavirus strain (Dubé et al., 2018).",
            "Recent studies conducted on both humans (Zhou et al., 2020; Collin et al., 2021) and mice (Ma et al., 2020) have demonstrated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors in ocular surface cells, a region comprising the epithelial cells of the cornea and conjunctiva. Furthermore, a remarkable level of ubiquity of ACE2 receptor expression was recently found in the trabecular meshwork and ocular choroid cells of the outer eye, the optic nerve, and optic radiation or geniculocalcarine tract to the occipital cortex, which suggests that multiple cell types of the visual system provide potential entry points for SARS-CoV-2 invasion (Hill et al., 2021). However, as ACE2 expression has been observed more in the conjunctiva than in the cornea, SARS-CoV-2 has greater neuroinvasive potential via the conjunctiva (Leonardi et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020). For the ocular surface to be considered a SARS-CoV-2 infection route, TMPRSS2 must be co-expressed along with ACE2, as TMPRSS2 acts as a cofactor in internalization of the complex (de Freitas Santoro et al., 2021). It should be noted that TMPRSS2 expression has been observed in both the cornea and the conjunctiva (Leonardi et al., 2020; Collin et al., 2021). However, the likelihood of the ocular surface being an infection gateway is low despite the potential of SARS-CoV-2 causing conjunctivitis and other ocular discomfort (Chen X. et al., 2021). However, the actual conjunctival transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be confirmed (de Freitas Santoro et al., 2021).",
            "The ocular surface is susceptible to viral infections by means of aerosols or direct contact with fomites resulting from exposure to external contaminants and is vulnerable to a higher level of exposure than the oral cavity or the nostrils (Coroneo, 2021; Figure 2B). In addition, clinical cases where conjunctivitis was the initial symptomatic manifestation in COVID-19 positive patients have been reported and confirmed via both nasopharyngeal swab samples and PCR test which detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in tears (Zhang X. et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2021). Nonetheless, confirmation of the conjunctival transmission of SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS requires further investigation.",
            "The BBB tightly regulates the movement of molecules, ions, and cells between blood and the CNS and prevents the neurotoxic components of plasma, blood cells, and pathogens from entering the brain (Montagne et al., 2017). This regulatory characteristic is attributed to the arteries, arterioles, and capillaries that supply blood to the brain and that act in response to neuronal stimuli that trigger an increased rate of neurovascular coupling, a mechanism generated by the cerebral blood flow and the supply of oxygen. The neurovascular unit is made up of the following structural components: vascular cells (endothelium and wall cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells); glia (astrocytes and microglia); and neurons (Kisler et al., 2017; Sweeney et al., 2019; Sanchez-Cano et al., 2021). The regulation conducted by the BBB provides strict control over the cellular permeability of neuronal tissues, which is essential for proper neuronal function and which, furthermore, requires precise ionic concentrations in the surrounding environment (Daneman, 2012; Daneman and Prat, 2015). Therefore, the loss of homeostatic regulation and deterioration in the restrictive capacity of the BBB play important roles in the progression of neurological conditions such as brain trauma, and infectious and neurodegenerative diseases (Sanchez-Cano et al., 2021).",
            "It is of particular interest to note that the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors are expressed in the endothelial cells of the BBB (Chen R. et al., 2020; Qiao et al., 2020; Torices et al., 2021). Due to these findings and the interaction of the virus with the protein complex discussed earlier in this paper, it has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could reach the brain via systemic circulation by crossing the BBB and damage the choroid plexus (Baig, 2020; Pellegrini et al., 2020). The actual hematogenous mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 gains entry to brain is not known. However, several mechanisms have been suggested (Achar and Ghosh, 2020; Pellegrini et al., 2020). These include: (a) transcellular migration, where the virus invades the host’s endothelial cells and is able to cross the BBB; (b) paracellular migration, where the virus invades the choroid plexus of the fenestrated endothelial cells and gets into the brain; and (c) the “Trojan horse” strategy, where the virus is internalized by phagocytic immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages, and is subsequently replicated in the brain (Dahm et al., 2016; Figure 2C). Moreover, is likely that SARS-CoV-2 invades the brain by damaging the integral architecture of the BBB (Varghese et al., 2020). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can get access into the brain by one or a combination of the above mechanisms.",
            "Both the symptoms presented by infected patients and the findings of clinical pathology provide evidence of possible infection of the CNS by SARS-CoV-2. However, to further explore the viral pathogenesis in the host and characterize the mechanisms of viral access and dissemination in the CNS, a translational neuroscience approach (Johansen et al., 2020; Sanclemente-Alaman et al., 2020), similar to that employed in the early research conducted on SARS and MERS is necessary (Callaway, 2020; Natoli et al., 2020).",
            "Because SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2) than animal ACE2, few studies have been carried out in animal models to determine the neuroinvasive pathways of the virus (Wan et al., 2020). In addition, hACE2 is structurally different from that in animal species. Hence, a significantly lower level of tropism is noted in animal vs. human tissue, particularly in relation to CNS (Natoli et al., 2020). Indeed, Brann et al. (2020) demonstrated that the olfactory sensory neurons of the whole olfactory mucosa of mice, unlike olfactory epithelial support cells, stem cells, and the cells of the nasal respiratory epithelium, do not express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes. Thus, it is argued that based off of animal studies, anosmia or other forms of olfactory dysfunction may not support olfactory bulb as an entry route for SARS-CoVs into the CNS (Brann et al., 2020; Natoli et al., 2020).",
            "To overcome the discrepancy between animal and human studies, several animal models with closer resemblance to that of humans have been suggested. One suggestion is to develop humanized mouse models that express the hACE2 receptor (Sun et al., 2020), as the murine is the most widely used animal model for this purpose (Muñoz-Fontela et al., 2020). Another suggestion is to modify the SARS-CoV-2 spike to effectively bind with murine-ACE2 (Dinnon et al., 2020), however, this strategy is risky, since modifying the viruses can create a natural reservoir for a virus that might be completely different from the wild-type version. A third suggestion is to induce mice to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection by sensitizing the respiratory tract to the virus. The latter may be achieved via transduction with adenovirus or associated viruses that express hACE2 (Ad5-hACE2 or AAV-hACE2, respectively) (Israelow et al., 2020; Rathnasinghe et al., 2020). In all these suggestions, however, as mentioned earlier, it must be borne in mind that the co-expression of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors is necessary for the virus to be internalized.",
            "It was recently demonstrated that neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV-2 could be achieved in an animal model where hACE2 was overexpressed by means of an adeno-associated virus infection (Song et al., 2021). Moreover, the neuronal infection could be prevented by blocking ACE2 with neutralizing antibodies or administering cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a COVID-19 patient, where presumably antibodies were present (Song et al., 2021). A recent study reported differences in the neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence among the most relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants, D614G, Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529) 5 days post inoculation in a hamster model. The results showed that D614G variant had a high neuroinvasion via the olfactory nerve compared to the Delta and Omicron variants (Bauer et al., 2022b). While the results obtained provide evidence for the neuroinvasive capacity of SARS-CoV-2 in an animal model, the sequence of infection in different CNS cell types has not yet been determined. Therefore, more studies on detailed mechanism (s) of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the CNS are needed.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to manifest neurological symptoms that range from mild to fatal, while it can also occur asymptomatically in patients. Clinical studies conducted on patients hospitalized with COVID-19 report a level of neurological manifestation ranging from 15.2% (Flores-Silva et al., 2021), or 36.4% (Mao et al., 2020) to 54.7% (Romero-Sánchez et al., 2020), and up to 88% (García-Moncó et al., 2021). It should be noted that the frequency of neurological alterations observed in patients with COVID-19 depends on whether they have been evaluated by a neurologist and/or inclusion of patients with a history of neurological complication.",
            "The most common early neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19 are headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, and neuralgia (Guan et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021). Anosmia and dysgeusia develop in the early stages of infection and are more frequent in less severe cases (Mao et al., 2020; Flores-Silva et al., 2021; García-Moncó et al., 2021). Late-infection neurological manifestations include acute cerebrovascular disease, meningoencephalitis, impaired consciousness, and skeletal muscle injury (Al Saiegh et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Guidon and Amato, 2020; Parikh et al., 2020). Less-frequently reported symptoms include dysautonomia, seizures, movement disorders, Guillain Barré syndrome, Miller Fisher syndrome, and optic neuritis (Gutiérrez-Ortiz et al., 2020; Hwang et al., 2020; Manji et al., 2020). In addition, the University College London Queen Square Institute of Neurology has reported five categories of clinical presentations at a neurological level: (1) encephalopathy with delirium/psychosis and no magnetic resonance imaging or cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities; (2) inflammatory CNS syndromes including encephalitis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; (3) ischemic strokes; (4) peripheral neurological disorders including Guillain–Barré syndrome and brachial plexopathy; and (5) miscellaneous central nervous disorders (Paterson et al., 2020; Gasmi et al., 2021). Thus, neurological manifestations are variable and not uncommon in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, both morphological and biochemical pathological changes may be manifested as detailed below.",
            "Research on the clinical and imaging aspects of COVID-19 infection as well as molecular biology studies conducted on both in vitro and in vivo models have provided valuable information in understanding the etiological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. However, despite the large amount of information available on the disease, there is little work conducted to characterize its pathological manifestations in the tissues of different systems of the body (Al Nemer, 2020; Skok et al., 2021; Table 1). Studies carried out on the anatomical brain pathology during autopsy reveal morphological alterations in the frontal and occipital lobes, olfactory bulb, cingulate gyrus, corpus callosum, hippocampus, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, midbrain, middle pons, medulla, brainstem, and the lateral ventricles (Barone et al., 2021; Caramaschi et al., 2021; Generoso et al., 2021). The most common gross findings are edema (Reichard et al., 2020), hemorrhagic lesions (Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020; Reichard et al., 2020), hydrocephalus (Lacy et al., 2020), atrophy and low brain mass (Lax et al., 2020; Wichmann et al., 2020), olfactory bulb asymmetry (Coolen et al., 2020), and infarcts (Solomon et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 has also been found to cause lesions and alterations in neuronal structures, while neuronal infection can cause encephalitis and the generation of lethal microthrombi (Bradley et al., 2020; von Weyhern et al., 2020). In addition, severe COVID-19 infection accompanied by multisystem inflammatory syndrome may cause fibrotic lesions and generate cerebral thrombosis (Turski et al., 2020).",

            "SNpr, substantia nigra pars reticulate; SNpc, substantia nigra pars compacta; IL, interleukin.",
            "Various studies have been carried out to ascertain the structural modifications in the brains of COVID-19 patients. Magnetic resonance techniques have shown a bilateral obliteration of the olfactory cleft in 50% of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as well as a sudden loss of smell and subtle olfactory bulb asymmetry in 25% of the sampled patients (Niesen et al., 2021). Another study demonstrated microstructural changes using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 3D high-resolution T1WI sequences in COVID-19 patients, where greater volume of bilateral gray matter (reported as gray matter volume) was observed in the hippocampus, olfactory cortices, insula, left rolandic operculum, left Heschl gyrus, and right cingulate gyrus (Lu Y. et al., 2020). These findings demonstrate possible alterations in the structural and functional integrity of brain microstructures in susceptible patients, and also suggest potential long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may lead to or accelerate a variety of neurodegenerative diseases (ElBini Dhouib, 2021), discussed further below.",
            "Given that most cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection present mild or moderate symptoms and that a group with severe infections develops multiple systemic dysfunctions as a consequence of imbalances in the immune and the oxidation-reduction systems, it is not surprising that inflammatory states and oxidative stress are commonly indicated in pathogenesis of COVID-19 (Mrityunjaya et al., 2020; Forcados et al., 2021). In addition, hyperactivation of the immune system leading to an exaggerated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines referred to as “cytokine storm” is not only associated with severe complications, but also poorer outcome (Chen G. et al., 2020; Noroozi et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021).",
            "Both the innate and adaptive immune systems have been widely described as working together, with the innate response representing the host’s first line of defense and the adaptive response becoming prominent several days after infection, when T and B cells have undergone clonal expansion (Strbo et al., 2014). Furthermore, the components of the innate system contribute to the activation of antigen-specific cells, which amplify their responses in order to achieve complete control over the pathogen by recruiting innate effector mechanisms. Therefore, the innate and adaptive responses are fundamentally different, although the synergy between them is essential for an effective immune response (Chaplin, 2010). Patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection manifest an increased innate immune response and a suppressed adaptive immunity, which is why a delayed elimination of the virus from the organism is observed (Pan Y. et al., 2021). This scenario aggravates the immune status of the patient as it increases the levels of various inflammatory factors and increases both the number and activation of immune cells at the site of the inflammation, a process from which cytokine storm originates (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Chen R. et al., 2021).",
            "Neurons infected by SARS-CoV-2 release inflammatory mediators that are capable of activating adjacent cells such as glia, microglia, mast cells and endothelial cells, conditions which constitute the beginning of neuroinflammation (Almutairi et al., 2021; Frank et al., 2022). Elevated immunological mediators during SARS-CoV-2 infection include: tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α); interferon gamma (INFγ); a series of chemokines such as CCL-2, CCL-5, and CXCL-10; a series of interleukins such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, and IL-33; and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Kempuraj et al., 2020; Mehta and Fajgenbaum, 2021; Tripathy et al., 2021). SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the down-regulation of ACE2, disrupting the physiological balance between ACE/ACE2 and angiotensin II (Ang-II)/angiotensin and leading to severe multiple organ injury (Mehrabadi et al., 2021). In fact, it has been suggested that ACE2 downregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of lung injury in COVID-19 (Ni et al., 2020). Angiotensin II stimulates gene expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6. TNF-α, in particular, induces macrophage differentiation of a pro-inflammatory phenotype, which exerts an antimicrobial effect. However, such differentiated macrophages are also responsible for recruiting more cell types via cytokine secretion, thus exacerbating the inflammatory response. Similarity, IL-6, essential for T cell differentiation, when elevated, signals a poorer SARS-CoV-2 prognosis (Banu et al., 2020; Patra et al., 2020; Ben Moftah and Eswayah, 2022).",
            "Additionally, the pro-inflammatory factors discussed above are able to cross the BBB, increase vascular permeability, and trigger further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from the microglia (da Fonseca et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2021). This cascade results in increased apoptotic activity, increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction and eventual neurodegeneration (Chaudhry et al., 2020; Chiricosta et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2021). Moreover, the high concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines can lead to the activation of the coagulation cascade, suppression of anticoagulant factors, and hence increase the chance of thrombosis (Al Saiegh et al., 2020; Levi et al., 2020). An opposite scenario may also manifest itself where an increase in fibrinolytic activity leading to an increase in the level of fibrin degradation and hemorrhagic conditions including aneurysms may be observed in certain patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Al Saiegh et al., 2020).",
            "The link between systemic and central inflammation, as well as between neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, is well known (Hurley and Tizabi, 2013; Schwartz and Deczkowska, 2016; Skaper et al., 2018). In nervous tissue, the increased levels of inflammatory mediators and glial cell activity caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection may pose an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD) as well as multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke and neurological trauma (Mohammadi et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Tekiela and Majersik, 2021). SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with senility is likely to increase the neuropathological intensity and contribute to the worsening of motor and cognitive deficits (Wang Y. et al., 2021; Yu et al., 2021). Indeed, one of the main risk factors for both COVID-19 and neurodegenerative disease is age (Ferini-Strambi and Salsone, 2021; Figure 3). Older people comprise the section of the population most prone to developing neurodegenerative diseases (Hou et al., 2019) and present with more severe clinical reaction to COVID-19 (Lebrasseur et al., 2021). In addition, lifestyle and preexisting conditions such as trauma, infection, metabolic disease, and stress can accelerate the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases (Graham and Sharp, 2019; Madore et al., 2020; Lotz et al., 2021).",
            "SARS-CoV-2 infection and possible links for both Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The common risk factors between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases is the age; the oxidative stress; and, neuroinflammation. It’s possible that COVID-19 patients are more susceptible to developing neurodegenerative diseases and that patients with neurodegenerative diseases are more susceptible to contracting COVID-19.",
            "It is important to note that protein aggregation in the brain is considered as one of the main reasons behind neurodegeneration. Protein aggregation has been observed for tau protein and Aβ peptide in AD; and α-synuclein for PD. The aggregation process spreads from one cell to another, and the aggregates and deposits formed impair brain function. It is unclear whether viral infections directly or indirectly cause neurodegeneration (Liu S. et al., 2021). However, it has been suggested that viruses can initiate pathological protein aggregation via a direct mechanism in Aβ peptide aggregation in vitro and in animal models infected with HSV-1 and respiratory syncytial virus (Ezzat et al., 2019). A recent study has shown direct interactions between the N-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and α-synuclein as the molecular basis for the observed correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infections and parkinsonism (Semerdzhiev et al., 2022). Given that cell-surface glycans function as initial, usually low-affinity attachment factors, these receptors play key roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection (Koehler et al., 2020; Prasad et al., 2021). Moreover, the ability of S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 to interact with heparin receptor can lead to many misfolded brain proteins including amyloid complex and ultimately lead to neurodegeneration (Tavassoly et al., 2020; Idrees and Kumar, 2021).",
            "One of the main causes of disability among older people around the world is dementia, with AD as the most common form (Alzheimer’s-Association, 2020). The mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AD are complex and not fully understood. However, the most accepted hypothesis involves molecular changes such as extracellular deposition of the β-amyloid protein and intracellular phosphorylation of the tau protein, causing the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively (Liu et al., 2019). In addition, intense neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and protein misfolding have also been implicated (Gandhi et al., 2019; Perez Ortiz and Swerdlow, 2019; Leng and Edison, 2021; Figure 3). Patients with AD are more susceptible to contracting COVID-19 (Finelli, 2021; Pan A. P. et al., 2021; Wang Q. et al., 2021), and COVID-19 patients are more susceptible to developing AD (Brown et al., 2020; Chiricosta et al., 2021; Villa et al., 2022). This might not be surprising due to the presence of common risk factors such as age, cardiovascular disease, metabolic, and psychological disorders between the two diseases (Brown et al., 2020; Finelli, 2021). Generally, inflammation increases with age, wherein higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been quantified in older people (Niraula et al., 2017; Rea et al., 2018). Furthermore, given that infection with a wide variety of pathogens is suspected to be a risk factor for the onset of AD (Seaks and Wilcock, 2020; Vigasova et al., 2021), an increased risk of developing AD and cognitive impairment in susceptible populations after SARS-CoV-2 infection would also be expected. Moreover, these patients often face social stigma and mental stress, which can further aggravate neuroinflammatory processes and result in psychiatric disorders (Justice, 2018; Milligan Armstrong et al., 2021). The presence of pathogens and other factors such as age, alcohol and tobacco consumption, cerebral hypoxia, metabolic diseases, pollution, sedentary lifestyle, or sleep disorders may cause BBB malfunction (Noe et al., 2020; Hussain et al., 2021), and hence lead to the infiltration of neurotoxic proteins such as the β-amyloid peptide (Wang D. et al., 2021). SARS-CoV-2 infection accompanied by a local immune response incorporating astrocytes and microglia could generate a state of neuroinflammation in susceptible patients that can manifest for a long term (Kumar et al., 2021; Villa et al., 2022). Such a scenario would be expected to exacerbate the current pathology in AD patients.",
            "Genetically, apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE4) has been determined the strongest risk factor for AD (Serrano-Pozo et al., 2021). Furthermore, APOE4 has been associate with increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 (Kurki et al., 2021). Cerebral microvasculature complications may be the basis of neurological issues in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Miners et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2021). Interestingly APOE4 is also involved in BBB dysfunction and cerebrovascular diseases (Montagne et al., 2021). However, further research is needed to determine the exact role of APOE4 in COVID-19-induced AD.",
            "Similar to AD, PD is related to COVID-19, sharing risk factors such as advanced age, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (Park et al., 2020; Fearon and Fasano, 2021; Sharifi et al., 2021). Moreover, patients with PD may be immunosuppressed, which makes them more susceptible to infections of any type including SARS-CoV-2 (Tansey and Romero-Ramos, 2019; Prasad et al., 2020).",
            "Histologically, PD is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and cytoplasmic inclusions, mainly composed of α-synuclein aggregates called Lewy bodies (Henderson et al., 2019; Figure 3). Although the precise etiology of PD is not well known, some hypotheses for its pathogenesis and development point to oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic pathogenesis, and also as a result of infection (Hurley and Tizabi, 2013; Meng et al., 2019). As patients in an advanced stage of PD have difficulties in chewing and swallowing, they commonly experience salivary accumulation and aspiration (Kwon and Lee, 2019). In addition, the stiffness of the chest wall common in PD inhibits the cough reflex, forming a favorable environment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the most severe cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection progresses to pneumonia, which is one of the leading causes of death in PD patients (Bhidayasiri et al., 2020). It is already well known that various viral infections can accentuate the pathological sequelae of PD (Jang et al., 2009).",
            "Recently, a study demonstrated the ability of the H1N1 influenza virus to block protein degradation pathways and promoting the formation of α-synuclein aggregates in dopaminergic neurons in vitro (Marreiros et al., 2020), and a more recent study provided similar results in an in vivo model (Bantle et al., 2021). Furthermore, increased amounts of phosphorylated α-synuclein, activation of microglia and astrocytes, and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc with behavioral and motor consequences have been observed as secondary consequences of infection with the western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) (Bantle et al., 2019). Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect similar consequences with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Chaná-Cuevas et al., 2020). Moreover, COVID-19 pandemic causing at least partial confinement and social distancing may not only limit the mobility but may also aggravate depression, mental stress, and loneliness in PD patients. It is noteworthy that there exists a substantial co-morbid condition of PD and depression (Tizabi et al., 2019, 2021).",
            "In this article, we have reviewed the possible routes by means of which SARS-Cov-2 may enter the CNS, including transcribrial or the ocular surface, and the hematogenous neuroinvasive pathways. The increased occurrence of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cytokine storm caused by the virus also increases the level of cellular damage in the CNS, thus increasing the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD. Further studies on effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants on protein aggregation, glia or microglia activation, BBB damage, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation is warranted.",

            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been extensively shown to cause many neurological sequelae, and cognitive deficits (known as “brain fog”) may particularly and widely occur even in individuals with mild symptoms [1]. Peripheral hyperinflammation as well as central nervous system (CNS) local immune responses may synergistically contribute to brain autoimmune injury. In addition to the direct neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 and nonimmune effects such as severe systemic hypoxemia and vascular thrombosis, the central mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 accelerates cognitive-related symptoms may be related to immune effects [2]. However, the precise neuroinflammatory mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been fully established. Fernández-Castañeda et al. [3] provided direct evidence and unique insights into the potential mechanism of cognitive impairment in mild respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.",
            "“Long COVID” has become another major public health crisis. The “lung-brain axis” has recently received increasing attention, and research published in Nature by Hosang et al. [4] suggested a close link between the lung microbiota and brain autoimmune responses, providing novel evidence that peripheral organs influence immune responses in the CNS. Inflammation has been considered to play a crucial pathogenic role and has been implicated in the neuropathological cascade leading to the development of cognitive dysfunction symptoms [5]. The inflammatory changes underlying SARS-CoV-2 post-infection that are associated with cognitive impairment, however, remain to be clarified. Fernández-Castañeda et al. [3] revealed that peripheral respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection causes significant and persistent CNS inflammation. Different immune challenges may induce diverse immunological responses, COVID-19 and pandemic influenza have both common and specific immune features.",
            "The peripheral cytokine storm initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection may subsequently impact and trigger an inflammatory response in the nervous system [6]. Understanding the pathological mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 affecting the nervous system is critical for selecting potential therapeutic targets for patients. Microglia are sensitive to even minor changes in the microenvironment within the CNS and may trigger subsequent inflammatory cascades, leading to secondary immune injury. Fernández-Castañeda et al. [3] demonstrated that the neuroinflammation caused by the mild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a link between mild respiratory COVID-19 and cognitive impairment. The CNS pathological mechanisms may be caused by the elevation of C-C motif chemokine ligand 11 (CCL11) associated with COVID-19, which exhibited similar neuropathology caused by cancer therapy. Neurotoxic CCL11 causes white matter selective microglial reactivity, then elevated CCL11 and active microglia lead to deleterious cascade effects on CNS multi-lineage neuronal cellular function and structure dysregulation, particularly on oligodendrocytes, myelinated axons, and hippocampal neurogenesis, which in turn causes the cognitive dysfunction symptoms in COVID-19 (Fig. 1).",
            "Fig. 1Neuroinflammation is the central pathophysiology that links mild respiratory COVID-19 to cognitive impairment. Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause an excessive peripheral inflammatory response to result in the consequent immune injury in CNS. The elevated CSF CCL11 and white matter microglial reactivity are associated with multi-lineage cellular dysregulation in the CNS, including impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, persistent loss of oligodendrocytes, and myelinated axons. SARS-CoV-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, COVID-19 coronavirus disease 2019, CCL11 C-C motif chemokine ligand 11, CNS central nervous system, CSF cerebrospinal fluid",

            "Taken as a whole, Fernández-Castañeda et al. [3] demonstrated that cognitive impairment following mild respiratory COVID-19 is associated with persistent neuroinflammation, providing robust animal and human data to illustrate the pathophysiological similarities between “COVID fog” and “chemo fog” syndromes. As such, anti-inflammatory strategies targeting microglia or CCL11 signaling may hopefully prevent and correct this multicellular dysregulation. However, the underlying precise regulatory mechanism and signal transduction mediating respiratory infection-induced microglial reactivity in subcortical white matter remain to be fully elucidated. The mechanisms of cognitive impairment in the context of other causes, such as ageing and stroke, might provide further insight into the mechanisms of COVID-19-related cognitive deficits. Moreover, given that the role of microglia is very complicated and can be both neuroprotective and neurotoxic, the determination of the key regulators that can convert microglia into an anti-inflammatory phenotype or regulate the initiation of microglial activity is urgently needed, as the manipulation of these regulators may have the ability to prevent or alleviate neuropathology and improve impaired cognitive performance. Nevertheless, additional studies should be performed to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of peripheral infiltrated immune cells, other subtypes of brain immune cells such as astrocytes, and cellular neuroimmune interactions between the CNS and peripheral systems [7].",
            "An analysis of 2-years retrospective cohort study indicated that the increased cognitive deficit after COVID-19 persisted throughout the follow-up [8]. Important questions remain that whether this pathology is reversible or permanent. Furthermore, it requires to be fully determined whether neuroimmune injury follows COVID-19 caused by novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as Omicron variants, or breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals, as well as whether infection with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in children could cause unique neuropathology. Therefore, studies and comparisons of patients in various mentioned situations with long-term clinical outcomes will be highly valuable.",

            "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease, globally. Dopaminergic neuron degeneration in substantia nigra pars compacta and aggregation of misfolded alpha-synuclein are the PD hallmarks, accompanied by motor and non-motor symptoms. Several viruses have been linked to the appearance of a post-infection parkinsonian phenotype. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has evolved from a novel pneumonia to a multifaceted syndrome with multiple clinical manifestations, among which neurological sequalae appear insidious and potentially long-lasting. Exosomes are extracellular nanovesicles bearing a complex cargo of active biomolecules and playing crucial roles in intercellular communication under pathophysiological conditions. Exosomes constitute a reliable route for misfolded protein transmission, contributing to PD pathogenesis and diagnosis. Herein, we summarize recent evidence suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection shares numerous clinical manifestations and inflammatory and molecular pathways with PD. We carry on hypothesizing that these similarities may be reflected in exosomal cargo modulated by the virus in correlation with disease severity. Travelling from the periphery to the brain, SARS-CoV-2-related exosomal cargo contains SARS-CoV-2 RNA, viral proteins, inflammatory mediators, and modified host proteins that could operate as promoters of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory cascades, potentially leading to a future parkinsonism and PD development.",
            "Parkinsonism is a clinical syndrome defined by the presence of resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability [1]. These motor symptoms are characteristically observed in Parkinson’s disease (PD) [2], which remains the primary cause of parkinsonism, but there are other disorders with the same symptoms that mirror it [3,4]. PD is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide after Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and constitutes a debilitating, progressive motor disorder characterized by degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway [5]. The prevalence of PD is estimated to be approximately 0.5–1% among those 65–69 years of age, rising to 3% among persons of 80 years and older [6], with an annual incidence rate of approximately 11–19/100,000 cases per year [7,8]. Although PD is generally an idiopathic disorder, there is 5–10% of PD cases that report a family history or display a clear Mendelian inheritance [9,10]. The incremental loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum is the mechanistic cause of motor manifestations, with 60–70% dopaminergic neuron loss required for the appearance of motor symptoms [11]. However, prior to motor manifestation onset, patients may display non-motor symptoms such as hyposmia, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and sleep disorders [12]. The neuropathological hallmark of PD is the misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn), which is the major protein component of Lewy bodies (LB). Indeed, formation of α-syn protein clumps within neural cells triggers the initiation of neurodegeneration processes [5].",
            "PD is a disease of multicomplex etiology, involving the interaction of aging, genetics, and environmental variables, as well as infectious agents, such as viral infections [13,14]. Additionally, there is now a wide range of data to support the existence of viral parkinsonism, which often manifests following recovery from viral infections [4]. Although the precise mechanisms remain unclear, viruses have been implicated as potential etiological or trigger factors for both PD pathogenesis [15,16] and viral parkinsonism [4]. Recent data suggest that the emerging human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the ongoing pandemic that has already killed more than 6.4 M people worldwide [17], may be one of these viruses [18,19,20].",
            "On cellular and molecular level, mitochondrial dysfunction, defective autophagy, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation are all thought to play a role in PD pathogenesis and they are linked to the accumulation and spread of misfolded α-syn [21,22,23]. The “prion-like” cell-to-cell dissemination of amyloidogenic proteins, such as α-syn, principally refers to the formation and subsequent spread of self-propagating pathological α-syn aggregates throughout brain regions and has lately garnered considerable attention in the quest to understand PD pathophysiology [24,25,26,27]. Several in vitro studies, both in animals and continuous human cell lines, have supported this reminiscent of, yet distinct from prion diseases, mechanism of misfolded α-syn spread [28,29,30]. Exosomes, the nanosized vesicles and masters of intercellular communication [31], have been proposed to serve as an efficient “vehicle” of transportation for such proteins [32], mainly because they are a priori involved in several homeostatic procedures in the central nervous system (CNS) including myelination maintenance, synaptic plasticity, antigen presentation, signal transduction, neurogenesis, and trophic support for neurons [33,34]. Interestingly, many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have been shown to regulate exosomal biogenesis and cargo content upon release from infected host cells [35,36]. On top of that, findings from our group and others suggest that a virus-manipulated exosomal cargo could become a blueprint for disease progression even after the complete eradication of the viral agent, due to either immune response-related or drug-mediated viral clearance [37,38]. Since exosomes have a prominent position in pathogenesis and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases [32] and are known to be closely linked both to viral infection establishment and infectious disease progression even after virus eradication [39,40], we aim in this review to point out and discuss potential exosome-mediated mechanisms that could lead to post-COVID-19 parkinsonism and PD pathogenesis.",
            "Several studies have demonstrated that viruses may contribute to the etiology of PD and parkinsonism, despite the fact that the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain obscure. The first recorded association between viral infections and parkinsonism was observed during the Spanish flu and the appearance of encephalitis lethargica, an unknown disease with parkinsonian phenotype in survivors [41]. Major human viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) [42], herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) [43], human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [44], varicella-zoster virus (VZV) [45], West Nile virus (WNV) [46], Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [47,48], and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) [49], have all been cited as risk factors for PD development or parkinsonism [3]. Notably, the role of influenza A virus (IAV) in the etiology of the transient parkinsonian phenotype [50] and in PD development [3] has been documented in several in vivo and especially in vitro studies. A case-control study found that an influenza diagnosis was linked to PD development 10 years following infection onset [51], while IAV was found postmortem in the substantia nigra of PD patients [52]. Furthermore, H5N1 infection in a mouse model resulted in Parkinson’s phenomenology, sustained microglial activation, and α-syn aggregation, leading to dopaminergic neuron loss in SNpc [53]. Similarly, H1N1 infection in mice resulted in persistent microglial activation as a sign of chronic virus-induced neuroinflammation that could potentially lead to neurodegeneration [54]. More recently, another in vitro study has demonstrated that H1N1 replication can directly disrupt protein homeostasis, inducing α-syn aggregates in Lund human mesencephalic dopaminergic cells, but failing to regulate TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) or tau protein. Those results clearly hint at a selective effect of H1N1 virus on α-syn misfolding [55].",
            "The key pathophysiological processes by which viruses contribute to parkinsonism development remain unclear; however, direct neuronal damage, sustained neuroinflammation, cerebral edema due to virus-mediated damage of brain endothelium, and induction of α-syn aggregation have all been proposed as crucial neurobiological pathways of dopaminergic neuron loss and α-syn pathology [3]. Notably, due to its tendency to entrap viral particles and reduce viral replication, α-syn has been postulated to be a natural antiviral defense mechanism for neurons [56]. This notion was supported by in vivo experiments, where WNV-infected α-syn-knockout mice showed decreased survival compared to the control group [57]. Additionally, it has been suggested that viruses can cause α-syn aggregation and oligomerization through molecular mimicry mechanisms [58,59]. Taken together, these observations strongly support the notion that virus-mediated neuronal deposition of pathological α-syn may induce neurotoxicity and PD pathology.",
            "The relationship between other members of the human Coronaviridae family, such as OC43 and 229E, and PD has been previously described, since antibodies against these coronaviruses were found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD patients [60]. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China at the end of 2019 and triggered an outbreak of atypical viral pneumonia [61]. Due to its enhanced transmissibility, this unusual coronavirus disease, also known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), marched fast over the world, constituting a huge public health burden [62,63]. SARS-CoV-2 spreads via infected secretions, such as saliva and respiratory droplets, through direct, indirect, or close contact with infected patients, even if COVID-19 symptomatology is absent [64,65]. While symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily systemic or respiratory, several studies demonstrate the presence of a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric consequences including anosmia, ageusia, altered consciousness, headache, seizures, and paresthesias [66,67,68]. Several studies have shown that COVID-19-related neurological sequelae might persist long after the acute phase of infection [69]. The term “long” or “post”-COVID-19 syndrome refers to a syndrome observed after the acute infection period and it is characterized by the presence of a combination of COVID-19-related symptoms lasting for more than 12 weeks [70]. These symptoms cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis and are considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) [71]. The post-COVID-19 syndrome includes a plethora of neurological manifestations such as fatigue, brain fog, cognitive impairment, and olfactory dysfunctions [72,73,74], many of which are also present in PD [2]. Thus, since SARS-CoV-2 shares immunopathological similarities with other viruses linked to parkinsonism, such as influenza [75], and because of COVID-19-related neurological consequences, it is reasonable to suspect that these persistent symptoms might be a prologue to a post-COVID-19 new-onset neurological disease.",
            "To date, only few cases of parkinsonism have been reported in literature following COVID-19 infection [19,20,76,77,78]. In these studies, the authors speculate a possible causative link between COVID-19 infection and a post-COVID new-onset parkinsonian phenotype, but they do not address the possibility of prodromal, pre-symptomatic PD, which became symptomatic as a result of biological or psychological stress processes associated with COVID-19. In the latter case, SARS-CoV-2 infection could act as a trigger that unmasks an underlying PD phenotype, possibly by stimulating neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative cascades. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been demonstrated to significantly worsen motor and non-motor symptoms in people with pre-existing PD [79,80]. Considering the prevalence of post-COVID-19 syndrome [81,82], a multicenter study found that 23 out of 27 PD patients developed post-COVID-19 symptoms, with the most common long term effects of COVID-19 being the deterioration of motor function and the requirement for increased levodopa daily dose, followed by fatigue, cognitive disturbances including brain fog, and sleep disorders [83].",
            "Probably the clinical symptoms most commonly shared between PD and COVID-19 are gustatory and especially olfactory dysfunctions. Indeed, both olfactory and gustatory impairments are among the earliest non-motor PD features [84,85]. Surprisingly, these are common early onset symptoms of COVID-19 and it has been observed that hyposmia–anosmia and dysgeusia could persist long after viral load decline, constituting a key clinical manifestation of the long COVID-19 syndrome [86,87]. Due to lack of evidence regarding the definite CNS infiltration, the olfactory route is discussed as a way for SARS-CoV-2 to gain access to the CNS. Indeed, a postmortem study demonstrated that the highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and spike protein (S protein) among various brain areas were found in the olfactory mucosal–nervous milieu, as well as in neuroanatomical areas related to the olfactory tract. In this regard, the olfactory mucosa could serve as an “anatomical bridge” for SARS-CoV-2 CNS invasion through axonal transport [88]. Furthermore, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an essential cell surface receptor responsible for S protein-mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2, was found to be expressed by epithelial cells of the human olfactory mucosa [89]. The extent of α-syn pathology in other brain regions has been substantially linked with the pathological burden in the olfactory bulb, suggesting that PD pathology extends along olfactory pathways [90]. The Braak hypothesis proposes that LB are initially found in olfactory structures, such as the olfactory bulb, and then they gradually spread towards the brain stem and ultimately to the cerebral cortex, strengthening the scenario that the earliest lesions could develop at non nigral areas [91,92]. Accordingly, Beach and colleagues have demonstrated that the olfactory bulb constitutes a primary affected area in α-synucleinopathies, including PD. In fact, it was suggested that the extent of α-synucleinopathy in the olfactory bulb strongly predicts the neuropathological confirmation of PD and reflects the severity of α-synucleinopathy in other brain regions [93]. Based on these studies, one could hypothesize that the olfactory route might pose a way for SARS-CoV-2 to gain access to the CNS, where it can modify neuropathological pathways pertinent to PD development.",
            "Another common pathology shared between PD and COVID-19 is the deregulation and dysfunction of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. GI symptoms and intestinal inflammation may emerge years before clinical indications of PD become apparent [94,95]. Specifically, gastrointestinal dysbiosis has been proposed to be involved in PD pathogenesis [96] and the enteric nervous system has been previously identified as a primary region for abnormal α-syn aggregation, which may then spread from the periphery to the CNS [97,98,99]. Specifically, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMV) receives signals from vagal parasympathetic neurons that project to the entire GI system. The DMV is involved in the PD–neuroanatomical pathway, since a monosynaptic nigro–vagal pathway that connects the SNpc to the DMV has been identified in the rat [100]. In postmortem PD studies, the DMV and the vagus nerve itself are among the most frequently afflicted structures [101,102] and they constitute principal areas of LB accumulation, even at the earliest stages of disease development [91]. In vitro research has shown that pathological α-syn may spread from the gut to the brain through the vagus nerve, with DMV being the first area of the brain to be impacted. From there, α-syn can spread to other PD brain regions including the SNpc, resulting in dopaminergic neuron loss and the appearance of the parkinsonian phenotype [103]. Interestingly, the vagus nerve has been proposed as a pathway through which SARS-CoV-2 can retrogradely invade the CNS, thus enhancing its neuroinvasiveness [104,105].",
            "Importantly, other GI manifestations, such as diarrhea, emerged as common clinical symptoms of COVID-19, while SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in fecal samples may persist post-infection [106]. On top of that, gut microbiota imbalance due to extrapulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been observed in COVID-19 [107,108]. This warrants further investigation because GI microbiota equilibrium plays an important role in several physiological processes ensuring brain integrity and neurogenesis [109,110]. Taken together, the above observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection could promote PD development and progression through a virus-exerted dysfunction of the GI system.",
            "Common inflammatory events unraveling during PD development and observed in the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as after COVID-19 remission, may indicate a link between these two disorders. Virus-mediated sustained or aberrant neuroinflammation could be a decisive pathobiological process for the initiation of a neurodegenerative disease, such as PD, long after recovery from the viral infection [111,112,113]. Indeed, growing evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 induces neuroinflammation [114] through its neurotropic, neuroinvasive, and neurovirulence effects [115,116] or even via immune-mediated pathways [117]. SARS-CoV-2 infection also triggers systemic inflammatory responses and induces cytokine release [118]. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a cytokine storm syndrome, which is a major cause of mortality [118,119]. Several studies have demonstrated the presence of inflammatory mediators, such as increased levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukins (IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the serum of COVID-19 patients [120,121,122,123]. Interestingly, a small prospective observational study had previously found that high levels of IL-6 were linked to a higher chance of developing PD [124]. Evidently, an exacerbated systemic infection that causes a huge release of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and antibodies, could lead to increased blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability [125]. Functional and structural integrity of the BBB is pivotal in maintaining brain homeostasis [126]. A neurovascular unit (NVU) consists of multiple cell types, including brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs), astrocytes, pericytes, microglia, and neurons, connected together with extracellular matrix components, and is a rigorous regulator of BBB permeability [127]. NVU disruption has been previously associated with neurodegenerative diseases [128]. In particular, BMVECs constitute an important component of NVU and are intricately interconnected through tight junction (TJ) proteins. However, inflammation affects BBB integrity and stability mainly through cytokine-induced degradation of TJ proteins [129]. SARS-CoV-2-mediated brain endothelial inflammation, upregulation of inflammatory mediators, and most significantly, disruption of BBB stability, have also been observed in human BMVECs [130]. According to in vitro studies, SARS-CoV-2 was shown to infect human BMVECs and cause a decrease in TJ protein expression [130,131]. Furthermore, incubation of human BMVECs with S protein resulted in enhanced ACE2 expression, thereby facilitating viral entry and inducing neuroinflammation [132].",
            "When BBB becomes impaired, pro-inflammatory cytokines and factors, innate immune cells from the periphery, and SARS-CoV-2 could possibly pass through and infiltrate the CNS. In that case, the CNS professional immune cells, microglia and astrocytes, may also become activated [133,134]. Neuroinflammation is then likely to set in fast, leading to elevated production of cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and secondary messengers [135]. Microglia, which are highly susceptible to pro-inflammatory stimuli, are concentrated in areas harboring dopaminergic neurons, making them particularly vulnerable to inflammatory mediators [136,137]. Interestingly, the S1 subunit of S protein was found to efficiently trigger neuroinflammation, including microglia activation, release of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, and cause behavioral deficits in rats [138]. Consequently, these neuroinflammatory cascades lead to enhanced apoptotic activity, increased ROS levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, and eventually neurodegeneration [139,140].",
            "Finally, cellular senescence is a core homeostatic event that provides yet another, age- and state-dependent substrate for neurodegeneration and the development of diseases like AD and PD [141,142]. Cellular senescence in the aging brain affects both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, and it is characterized by a broad array of interconnected disruptions, such as disruptions in autophagy, bioenergetics, and mitochondrial dynamics, as well as the onset of low-grade inflammation [142]. This cumulative array of dysfunction culminates in the accumulation of proteopathic seeds, including tau, amyloids, and α-syn, and tissue-wide remodeling [141]. It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces “immunosenescence” and enhances the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in infected tissues, via disruption of host antiviral mechanisms, such as interferon signaling pathways [143,144,145]. Taken together, all the aforementioned studies strongly indicate that the COVID-19 cytokine storm and innate immunity dysregulation may cause neuroinflammation and, in consequence, neurodegeneration.",
            "Neuropathological findings in postmortem brain tissues from COVID-19 patients further support the involvement of COVID-19-related neuroinflammatory processes in PD development. A postmortem brain study of 43 COVID-19 patients has shown activation of microglia and CNS infiltration by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, more apparent in the brainstem [146]. Regardless of COVID-19 disease severity, significant inflammatory responses such as astrogliosis, microglia activation, and perivascular T-lymphocyte infiltration were observed postmortem in both white and gray matter of patient brains [147]. Performing single-nucleus RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry on tissue from a group of individuals who died with COVID-19 and a group of individuals who died from other causes, Yang and colleagues revealed glia transcriptomic changes that indicated a COVID-19-associated activation of inflammatory pathways. The ensuing dysregulation of homeostatic pathways could potentially lead to neurodegeneration [148]. Specifically, microglia and astrocytic subpopulations were enriched by inflammatory genes and deregulated neuroprotective ones that had been previously linked to PD and other human neurodegenerative diseases, such as the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3), and others [149,150].",
            "Another mechanism that may contribute to PD pathogenesis involves the renin–angiotensin system and ACE2, which are implicated in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and may play a role in neuroinflammation-mediated neurodegeneration in PD [151,152]. ACE2 is highly expressed in several brain areas [153], including striatum [154], the substantia nigra, the olfactory bulb [155], and the brain endothelium [130,156,157]. Induced pluripotent stem cells (IPCS) derived from midbrain dopaminergic neurons were shown to be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro [158], unravelling the potentially direct neurotrophic effect of SARS-CoV-2 in strategic PD areas. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-induced Toll-like receptor (TLR) overactivation led to ACE2 upregulation and promoted the neurotrophic and neuroinflammatory outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection [159]. TLRs belong to the family of innate immune receptors and play an important role in the activation of innate immunity, including activation of glial cells. TLR-mediated stimulation of intracellular signaling pathways culminates in the release of proinflammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-1, TNF-a, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) [160]. Protein-to-protein interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and TLR-4 has been previously recorded [161]. SARS-CoV-2-mediated overactivation of the TLRs may lead to hyperinflammation, ACE2 upregulation and microglia switching from the neuroprotective to the neurotoxic phenotype [159,162]. In sequel, sustained gliosis and prolonged neuroinflammation could lead to α-syn aggregation and finally loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc [112].",
            "Aside from neuroinflammation, dysregulation of several homeostatic molecular pathways has been identified in PD onset and development. These alterations also occur during host–virus interactions as the virus attempts to direct critical cellular infrastructure towards completion of its own lifecycle. SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins were shown to post-translationally reconfigure the biological function of 24 host proteins expressed in lung. The latter act as perturbators and interact with 44 CNS proteins that are known to be implicated in PD pathogenesis [163]. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2-mediated deregulation of Rab7a and nucleoporin-62 (NUP62) could be strongly involved in PD pathogenesis, because Rab7 lysosomal protein decreases α-syn aggregation and associated neurotoxicity [164], while NUP62 is crucial for autophagosome development [165]. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 proteins can interact and bind to a variety of human protein trafficking molecules. Protein trafficking, translation, transcription, and ubiquitination regulation are all coordinated by these biomolecules, leading to neuroprotection, protection of BBB integrity, and neurogenesis [166]. A recent study demonstrated a direct interaction between SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) and α-syn, which led to the aggregation of the latter into amyloid fibrils, a highly pathogenic form of the protein, linked to PD. Co-administration of SARS-CoV-2 N protein and α-syn to a PD cell model resulted in twice the neuron loss due to neurotoxicity compared to control cells treated with α-syn alone [167].",
            "Other important cellular processes implicated in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in SNpc are thought to be oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and the impairment of protein degradation systems [168,169,170].",
            "A key molecular factor in PD development and progression is mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress [171,172]. An imbalance between ROS generation and cellular antioxidant activity leads to oxidative stress and ROS can further affect mitochondria, attenuating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production as well as causing damage to mitochondrial DNA [173]. In addition to causing direct cellular damage, oxidative stress can speed up neuron degeneration by inducing inflammatory or apoptotic pathways, such as NF-κB or caspase activation [174]. In PD studies, mitochondrial dysfunction may occur months before the onset of striatal dopaminergic neuron loss [175] and PD patients have been well documented to possess reduced or deficient mitochondrial complex I activity in the SNpc [176,177]. In mice, accumulation of wild-type α-syn in dopaminergic neurons reduced mitochondrial complex I activity and elevated ROS production, leading to cell death [178]. SARS-CoV-2 seems to interact with and manipulate mitochondria in order to hijack and evade mitochondria-mediated immune response for its own replication and survival [179,180]. In this effort, SARS-CoV-2 may induce mitochondrial impairment [181,182], mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress, and mitochondrial damage through mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, and enhanced ROS release [183,184,185]. Furthermore, the virus prevents mitophagy by blocking the binding of p62 and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3), thereby hindering viral RNA breakdown [185].",
            "Finally, mitochondria aid the antiviral immune response by allowing release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [186]. ACE2 has been suggested to regulate mitochondrial function [187]. Its expression is decreased when SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to ACE2 on microglia cells, causing ATP reduction and activation of the ROS-generating enzyme NADPH oxidase [188]. The ensuing increase in ROS production and oxygen consumption may lead to neuroinflammation and loss of neighbor dopaminergic neurons [189].",
            "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including PD [190,191]. ER homeostasis disruption and extended ER stress lead to misfolded protein accumulation and may stimulate particular proapoptotic pathways through the activation of the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and cysteine proteases caspase-4/12 [192,193]. Growing evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with the ER compartment and may induce ER stress [194,195]. SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame 8 (ORF8) is capable of inducing ER stress by triggering the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and inositol-requiring enzymes 1 (IRE1) branches of the ER stress pathway [196], potentially leading to α-syn accumulation [197]. Aside from initiating apoptotic pathways, ER stress is a powerful stimulator of NF-κB activation and inflammatory gene transcription [198,199]. SARS-CoV-2 also appears to activate NF-κB, causing inflammation, possibly through ER stress or via interaction with the non-structural protein Nsp5 [200]. Notably, NF-κB is a crucial transcription factor that regulates inflammation and dopaminergic neurons loss in PD patients [201]. Hence, deregulation of this signaling pathway has been linked to PD onset and pathology [202] by favoring α-syn accumulation, aggregation, and spreading, oxidative stress-induced neuron apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and dopaminergic neuron loss [139,203,204].",
            "When aggregation and deposition of misfolded α-syn elicit dopaminergic neuron loss, protein degradation systems come to the rescue. The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy–lysosomal pathway (ALP) are important proteolytic systems in neurons and critical for refolding or elimination of misfolded proteins; therefore, they play a significant role in cellular homeostasis [205]. Impairment or even failure of these systems may contribute to PD pathogenesis and progression [21,206]. SARS-CoV-2 virulent components, such as ORF proteins, seem to modify autophagy formation and function, leading to SARS-CoV-2-induced autophagy disruption and potentially neuron damage [207,208]. Specifically, ORF3a was shown to impede autophagosome–lysosome (A-L) fusion and ALP formation by interacting directly with the VPS39 subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex. ORF3a further damages lysosomes and impairs their function. Remarkably, this feature of HOPS-VPS39-mediated A-L fusion inhibition appears to be unique to SARS-CoV-2, since the quite similar ORF3a of SARS-CoV was ineffective in inhibiting A-L fusion [209]. Furthermore, another study found that although ORF7a protein stimulates autophagy, it also limits A-L fusion progression by downregulating the SNAP29 protein via caspase 3 (CASP3) activation, providing a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 uses the autophagic system to facilitate its own propagation [210]. Interestingly, a SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease has been identified to directly cleave serine/threonine unc-51-like kinase (ULK1) and prevent ULK1-ATG13 complex formation [211]. ULK1 is an upstream autophagy orchestrator, which phosphorylates key regulatory proteins in autophagosome formation [212]. In this regard, ULK1 cleavage is expected to completely inhibit the ALP function, due to lack of autophagosome formation. Evidently, autophagy is crucially involved in the regulation of the antiviral immune response. The striking correlation between SARS-CoV-2-induced aberrant inflammation and the observed autophagy defects [213] suggests that the virus-induced cytokine storm could be mediated by the failure of autophagy mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis.",
            "Overall, SARS-CoV-2 seems to interfere and disrupt several host cellular and molecular pathways involved in proper neuronal functions, potentially promoting PD pathogenesis. A summary of these overlaps is depicted in (Figure 1).",
            "Exosomes are one of three main subtypes of extracellular vesicles (EVs) (microvesicles, exosomes, and apoptotic bodies) secreted by the cells [214]. They are secreted from the majority of cell types and can also be isolated from body fluids, such as saliva, plasma, serum, urine, CSF, etc. [215,216]. Exosomes contain cell-specific cargos of proteins, lipids, DNAs, and coding/non-coding RNAs from the donor cells that can be preferentially delivered to targeted recipient cells. They represent a recently discovered mode of intercellular communication that may play a major role in many cellular processes in both physiological and pathological conditions [217,218].",
            "Exosomes are EVs [219] with a cup-shaped appearance in transmission electron microscopy and size ranging from 30 to 150 nm [220,221]. Exosomes emerge from the endosomal compartment following a series of events, starting with the inward budding of the plasma membrane that gives rise to the early endosome [222]. Then, budding and modification of the limiting membrane of endosomes leads to formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), whose accumulation produces late endosomes or large multivesicular bodies (MVBs) [221,223]. MVBs can either fuse with the plasma membrane and release ILVs as exosomes into the extracellular space, or with lysosomes, where ILV cargo will be degraded [224]. Biogenesis of ILVs, trafficking of MVBs, and secretion of exosomes are mainly regulated by endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) [225]. The ESCRT machinery consists of a set of cytosolic protein complexes that become attracted to endosomes by membrane proteins usually tagged with ubiquitin [226]. This multi-subunit protein system is essential for membrane remodeling and cargo sorting of MVBs [227], although some studies found that ILVs are also formed in the absence of ESCRT machinery (ESCRT-independent pathway), with the enzyme sphingomyelinase and tetraspanin proteins, such as CD9, CD63, and CD81, playing a pivotal role [228]. When exosomes reach the target cell, they can be internalized through specific endocytotic mechanisms, fuse directly with the plasma membrane or bind to cellular surface receptors [229,230,231].",
            "Exosomal surface indicators, such as the tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD81, ALG 2-interacting protein X (ALIX), tumor susceptibility gene 101 protein (TSG101), and ESCRT proteins, have all been identified and used to characterize exosomes in vitro and in vivo [31]. Because of their varied cellular origin, exosomal biomolecular composition is highly heterogeneous, bearing characteristics from both surface proteins and the cargo of their donor cells [223,232]. For example, neuron-derived exosomes are characterized by the presence of L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), a surface exosomal marker highly expressed in neurons [233]. Furthermore, their biocompatibility and bi-layered lipid structure, which shield cargo from degradation, reduce immunogenicity and enable exosomes to pass through major biological membranes, including the BBB [219]. Considering that exosomes can cross the BBB and act as fingerprints of their cellular originators, they could be used as CNS biomarkers that can be isolated and recovered from the periphery, with minimally invasive techniques [234].",
            "The usage of exosomes for the removal of accumulated, misfolded proteins increases under pathological conditions, particularly in proteinopathies [235,236]. Specifically, when other cellular clearance systems, such as the proteasome and ALP, fail to eliminate aggregated amyloidogenic proteins, exosomes come to the rescue [237]. Thus, exosomes may have a prominent role in PD, as they represent a potential spreading pathway for misfolded proteins, thereby contributing to pathogenesis and also to disease diagnosis through cargo analysis [238,239].",
            "The “prion-like” mode of α-syn spread lies at the heart of PD pathogenesis, as the molecular mechanisms leading to α-syn seeding and aggregation remain unknown [240]. Exosomes, as key intercellular mediators in the CNS, may provide a valuable vehicle for the transmission of α-syn [32,236]. Unlike other cell-to-cell transmission mechanisms, such as non-classical exocytosis or transport via nanotubules, exosomes can mediate α-syn transfer over longer distances [241]. The oligomeric form of α-syn is thought to be the toxic form causing neuronal death. Danzer and colleagues identified the presence of oligomeric α-syn in exosomes from continuous cell lines and primary cells and demonstrated that exosomal α-syn is more easily taken up by recipient cells than the free oligomeric form of protein [242]. Other researchers used various in vitro and ex vivo cellular systems to verify the presence of α-syn in exosomes [243,244]. Considering that loss of dopaminergic neurons is associated with PD progression and worsening of motor symptoms, exosomes generated by α-syn-treated microglia exhibited a considerably higher neuron apoptosis rate than control exosomes, in an in vitro experiment [245]. Exosomes isolated from patients with PD can induce the oligomerization of soluble α-syn in recipient cells, increasing neurotoxicity and speeding up α-syn aggregate formation [246]. Additionally, serum exosomes derived from PD patients contain α-syn, which can induce behavioral and pathological features of PD in mice [247]. Taken together, data from the abovementioned studies suggest that by regulating uptake and transfer of abnormal α-syn to nearby cells, exosomes are key regulators of PD pathogenesis and its spatiotemporal evolution [248,249].",
            "Aside from trafficking α-syn, exosomes interfere in intercellular inflammatory pathways, enhancing the possibility of PD outcomes [250]. There is abundant evidence that neuroinflammation plays a vital role in PD onset and progression [23]. A sound inflammatory response is essential for tissue repair and misfolded protein breakdown, but an excessive and delayed inflammatory response can lead to a deregulated neuroinflammatory cycle [251]. Microglia are considered to be the resident brain macrophages. By phagocytosing dead cells and helping with the removal of misfolded protein aggregates from the brain, they play an important role in the removal of extracellular α-syn species, including exosome-contained protein [252]. At the same time, microglia could be activated by exosomal α-syn, and elicit an immunological response with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in dopaminergic neuron death [253]. Ιn addition to their well-established role in neuroinflammation, microglia appear to be involved in intercellular spreading of neurotoxic α-syn [254]. Furthermore, exogenous introduction of human α-syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) into primary microglial cell cultures stimulates the release of α-syn-containing exosomes, which were fully capable of inducing protein aggregation in recipient neurons [255]. This release of α-syn following PFF treatment could be an effort to monitor and control intracellular levels of misfolded protein, possibly attributed to the deregulation of the ALP pathway in microglia [255]. Autophagic activity impairment and lysosome dysfunction have been previously correlated to increased release of exosomes from neuronal cells and to exosomes-mediated α-syn spread and transmission [21,237,256].",
            "Recent advances concerning immunosenescence studied its dissemination on tissue level, via exosomes. Specifically, cell-level stressors may induce a pro-inflammatory phenotypic shift in afflicted cells, and subsequently this shift may be communicated via specific exosomal cargo in a para- and juxtracrine manner [257]. Notably, interferon-responsive genes and proteins, such as the IFITM3 protein, may be loaded during such transmissions, representing a tissue-level signal of inflammation [258]. Depending on the cargo and cell of origin, exosomes may conversely ameliorate the SASP [259], thereby abating inflammation [260,261].",
            "To date, the diagnosis of PD depends on the clinical manifestations of the disease and it is determined by the presence of motor symptoms [2]. PD diagnosis may be difficult, especially in early pre-symptomatic stages, due to the absence of motor symptoms [262]. Hence, a low clinical diagnostic accuracy rate in the preclinical phase has been reported [263]. The usage of exosomal cargo as a potential “biomarker” or “early indicator” of PD pathology and progression has piqued great interest. Notably, exosomal α-syn has been proposed as a potential biomarker for PD in multiple studies [238,239,246,264]. Shi and colleagues found that CNS-derived exosomal α-syn was considerably higher in PD patients than in controls and it had a significant relationship with disease severity [238]. Similarly, a longitudinal investigation revealed that α-syn levels in neuronal exosomes were significantly higher in patients with early-stage PD compared to control groups, and that higher α-syn levels were linked to the progression of motor impairment [264]. Another study found that levels of CNS-derived exosomal α-syn were lower in early-stage PD patients compared to individuals with essential tremor and the control group [239]. In salivary EVs from PD patients, it was demonstrated that absolute levels of α-syn oligomers and the ratio of α-syn oligomers over total α-syn were increased compared to healthy controls, indicating that they could be used as diagnostic biomarkers [265]. Mean levels of neuron-derived exosomal α-syn have been proposed to distinguish PD from other cases of atypical parkinsonism and neurodegenerative diseases, as a twofold increase was observed in patients with preclinical and established PD compared to the other etiologies [266].",
            "As far as other neurospecific exosomal cargo proteins are concerned, it has been shown that CNS-derived exosomal tau levels were considerably higher in PD patients compared to controls, and notably but not significantly increased compared to those of AD patients [267]. Furthermore, levels of clusterin, apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), and the complement C1r subcomponent were significantly lower in PD patients at Hoehn and Yar stages II and III (a scale for assessing the functional impairment caused by PD) compared to healthy controls [268]. Conversely, neuron-derived exosomal protein deglycase DJ-1 was higher in PD patients compared to controls [269].",
            "In addition to misfolded proteins, exosomes serve as a conduit for transport of other RNA species such as microRNA (miRNA). Exosomal miRNAs regulate gene expression in recipient cells at a post-transcriptional level, thereby interfering with several physiological processes in the CNS, including homeostasis, neuron growth, cell migration, and brain endogenous immunity [270]. Mounting evidence has proposed a pivotal role for exosomal miRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD [271]. Firstly, they can inhibit protein synthesis after cellular uptake of exosomes [272]. Secondly, they can directly bind to TLRs and trigger neuroinflammation [273], and thirdly, they can induce oxidative stress pathways leading to neurotoxicity [274]. Given the diverse roles of miRNAs in PD pathogenesis, several studies have focused on their diagnostic value. Gui and colleagues studied the alterations in the miRNA profiles of CSF-derived exosomes from PD patients, finding that 16 exosomal miRNAs were elevated and 11 miRNAs were downregulated in PD in comparison with the control group. Characteristically, miR-1 and miR-19b-3p were identified to be considerably decreased in PD-CSF exosomes. MiR-153, miR-409-3p, miR-10a-5p, and let-7g-3p, on the other hand, were increased in that patient group [275]. Another study in serum exosomes from PD patients observed a drop in miR-19b expression and an elevation in miR-195/miR-24 expression in PD patients compared to healthy controls [276]. Finally, exosomal miRNAs were successfully used to differentially diagnose PD stages from healthy controls, showing that those miRNAs could serve as specific biomarkers both for early PD detection and PD progression [277].",
            "Exosomes play a critical role in viral infections [278]. Exosomes and viruses share structural and physicochemical features, such as size, shape, biochemical composition, and biomolecule transportation pathways within cells [279,280]. Thus, exosomes constitute a new frontier in the realm of viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2.",
            "A proposed way of viral spreading is via exosomes that contain viral particles or components. In the case of respiratory viruses, several studies showed that viral antigens are present in circulating exosomes recovered from lung transplant recipients infected with rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus [281]. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, exosomal cargo contains viral proteins or peptide fragments, such as the N and S proteins [282,283], whose presence has been linked to enhanced viral propagation, host immune reaction, and induction of a cytokine storm [284]. Barberis and colleagues identified for the first time viral genetic material in the exosomal cargo of COVID-19 patients, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may also be using the endocytic pathway to spread [285].",
            "The “Trojan exosome hypothesis”, in which retroviruses employ EVs to penetrate host cells, boost viral propagation, and elude the immune response, was introduced by Gould and colleagues [286] and was later supported by several reports [40]. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus uses multiple steps to achieve entry into the host cell, including ACE2-mediated receptor binding and transmembrane serine protease-2 (TMPRSS2)-mediated intracellular cleavage [287]. Recent data revealed that EVs carry and transfer ACE2 between different types of cells [288]. This led to the development of a competitive inhibitory therapy against SARS-CoV-2, in which ACE2-expressing EVs compete for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S1 domain, limiting viral infection [289].",
            "Exosomes released during viral infection contain inflammatory markers that cause a strong inflammatory response, acting as pathogen-related molecular patterns, thereby enhancing pathogenicity [290]. For example, exosomal CD9 has been shown to be involved in the route for EV-mediated viral transmission, by speeding up lentiviral infection and improving transduction effectiveness in B- and T-lymphocytes [291]. In addition, CD9 cooperates with TMPRSS2 to cleave viral fusion glycoproteins, thus facilitating the entry of coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV, into lung cells [292]. These findings suggest that CD9 and other exosomal tetraspanins could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Proteomic analysis of plasma-derived exosomal cargo from COVID-19 patients revealed that circulating exosomal proteins are strongly correlated with pathological procedures leading to COVID-19 tissue damage, such as immune hyperactivation, coagulopathy induction, and inflammation [285]. Monosialodihexosyl ganglioside (GM3)-enriched exosomes are positively connected with disease severity in COVID-19 cases [293].",
            "Given the established role of exosomes both in pathophysiological neuronal processes, and PD development and progression [294,295], as well as their emerging significance in SARS-CoV-2 infection and propagation [285], we believe that cascading from SARS-CoV-2 infection to post-COVID-19 parkinsonism and, possibly PD onset via exosomal cargo, should be at the research forefront. The putative roles of SARS-CoV-2-related exosomal cargos in the development of viral parkinsonism and/or PD pathogenesis are outlined and described in the next two paragraphs.",
            "Following COVID-19 recovery and viral clearance, exosomes could be at the center of neuroinflammatory crossroads. Experimental studies in other several systemic inflammatory conditions, such as obesity [296] and rheumatoid arthritis [297], have outlined a strong relationship between peripheral systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation [298,299]. Exosomes could operate as physical bridges between these two conditions since they can traverse the BBB. In vivo proof of exosomes acting as neuroinflammatory mediators under systemic inflammation conditions has recently been obtained. Specifically, in a mouse model that received serum-derived exosomes from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged mice, brain gliosis, CNS expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA and inflammation-associated miR-155 were all increased [300]. In addition, exosomes generated by peripheral immune cells, such as activated monocytes and macrophages, were shown to be taken up by neurons and astrocytes, resulting in pathological cargo dissemination and neurotoxicity [301].",
            "Serum exosomes from PD patients revealed increasing levels of IL-1 and TNF-α inflammatory mediators in comparison with the control group, while intravenous or intrastriatal administration of PD exosomes to mice induced α-syn aggregation, microglia activation, and neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons, leading to worsening of motor symptoms [247]. Conversely, exosomes containing pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, can effectively be shed by glial cells [302]. This glia-derived insidious exosomal cargo can spread to neurons, contributing to a vicious cycle of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration [245], a phenomenon further associated with older age [303].",
            "The presence of inflammatory mediators in exosomes derived from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells could potentially enhance the model of neuroinflammation and ensuing neurodegeneration via peripheral systemic inflammation, possibly promoting a cellular milieu that favors PD development and progression mechanisms. Exosomal analysis from COVID-19 patients revealed high levels of tenascin-C (TNC) and fibrinogen-β (FGB) compared to controls. Both TNC and FGB induce release of pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB signaling, leading to the presence of TNF-α, IL-6, and chemokine CCL5 upon exposure of hepatocytes to exosomes from COVID-19 patients. In this regard, a potential “window” of inflammatory insults to distant tissues should be examined [304].",
            "Current knowledge so far suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein seems to play a central role in exosome-mediated regulation of neuroinflammatory events pertinent to neurodegeneration. Thus, S protein or S-derived fragments were discovered in plasma exosomes isolated from COVID-19 patients, with an increased exosomal presence in clinical cases with moderate rather than severe disease. Multiomics exosomal analysis identified several molecules involved in immune responses, inflammation, and activation of both coagulation and complement pathways in infected patients compared to the control group of healthy subjects [284].",
            "Furthermore, an in vitro study demonstrated that ectopic expression of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in HEK-293T cells generated a large number of exosomes highly loaded with miR-148a and miR-590. These exosomal miRNAs decreased gene expression of ubiquitin specific peptidase 33 (USP33), a deubiquitinase enzyme (DUBs)-stabilizer of its target protein, and of interferon regulatory factor 9(IRF9). They also deregulated the USP33-IRF9 network following their internalization in human microglia cells. IRF9 had been previously identified as a protective functional protein in CNS homeostasis, and its absence could result in severe neurological damage in glial cultured cells due to interferon (IFN)-α-mediated overexpression of IFN-γ-like genes [305]. Reduced microglial USP and IRF9 levels effectively induced the production of important inflammatory gene pathways such as TNF-β, NF-κB, and IFN-β, culminating in neuroinflammatory cascade activation [306]. Apart from that, exosomes recovered from plasma of COVID-19 patients revealed the presence of S protein-derived fragments fully capable of inducing the immune system response. Evidently, exosomes from patients with mild disease severity exhibited higher amounts of MHC class II-antigen-presenting protein able to interact with CD4+ T-cells and boost their proliferation and activation [284]. MHC II overexpression, CD4 activation, and invasion of the CNS can all cause IFN-mediated phagocytic conversion of brain myeloid cells [307]. The ensuing neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neuron loss in the SNpc could conceivably lead to a PD phenotype [308,309].",
            "Neuroinflammation mediated by host regulatory factors may also be conferred by SARS-CoV-2-manipulated exosomes. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear protein involved in several CNS procedures such as inflammation, apoptosis, and autophagy regulation [310]. Elevated levels of HMGB1 in serum and CSF from PD patients have been observed [311]. Notably, inhibition of HMGB1 has been shown to reduce microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, neuron dopaminergic loss, and progression of PD pathology in PD animal models [311,312]. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels are a protein-indicator of axonal damage and serve as a biomarker for several neurodegenerative diseases, including PD [313,314]. At the same time, it has been suggested that NfL levels may potentially reflect neuroinflammatory processes leading to neurodegeneration in the early stages of multiple sclerosis development [315]. Analysis of the exosomal cargo of neuron-derived EVs (NDEV) isolated from post-COVID 19 patients with or without neurological symptoms showed high levels of HMGB1 and NfL compared to the control group, thereby implicating SARS-CoV-2 infection in the regulation of the two pro-PD development factors [316].",
            "Loaded with SARS-CoV-2 components and RNA, as well as virally-induced neuroregulatory molecules, exosomes are fully capable of accessing hard-to-reach neuroanatomical areas, such as the olfactory bulb [88], the hypothalamus [317], the DMV, and the brainstem [317,318,319]. A possible route allowing access to exosomes traveling long distances from peripheral tissues that are prime sites of infection, such as the intestine and the lungs, to the brain could be through retrograde axonal transport from peripheral nerves [320,321]. In that case, SARS-CoV-2-related exosomes could end up disrupting normal homeostatic molecular mechanisms in brain areas that have been previously associated with PD pathogenesis [322,323,324]. Indeed, a COVID-19 postmortem study detected major neurological damage, but only low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the brains of expired patients [325]. Furthermore, cortical accumulation of total α-syn was observed following viral eradication in a SARS-CoV-2 intranasally-infected hamster model without any indication of inflammation and neurodegeneration [326]. Extending the Braak hypothesis, one could argue that any neurological sequelae and neuropathological outcomes observed in COVID-19 survivors may emerge both directly, due to virus-exerted effects, and indirectly, through molecular and neuroinflammatory mediators, carried by SARS-CoV-2-related exosomes remaining in circulation even after elimination of the virus.",
            "The neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, according to Ahmed and colleagues, could be attributed, at least in part, to exosomal mRNA and transcriptional factors (Tfs) carried from the lungs to the brain areas [327]. These exosomal Tfs have the ability to regulate cellular gene expression transcriptionally and induce neuronal alterations consistent with imminent neurodegeneration. Among 19 exosomal Tfs found overexpressed during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, BCL3, JUND, MXD1, IRF2, IRF9, and STAT1 were observed to activate genes associated with PD pathogenesis in strategic areas of the brain, such as the medial and lateral substantia nigra and the superior frontal gyrus region. These genes are implicated in a variety of physiological activities, including signal transduction, neuron death, and immunological surveillance. Evidently, their Tf-mediated dysregulation could contribute to neurodegeneration and PD pathology. For example, STAT1 triggers microglia activation and dopaminergic neurons’ autophagy under hypoxia, including COVID-19 manifested hypoxia [328,329,330].",
            "Exosomes may be further implicated in the association between SARS-CoV-2 and PD via the transfer of protein expression regulators from the periphery, through the BBB and into the CNS. It has been suggested that such factors could interact with proteins that are highly expressed in the CNS and are linked to PD. A relevant study demonstrated that 24 host lung proteins were subjected to post-translational modifications by SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Then, they were taken up and transported out of the lungs into the CNS by exosomes, leading to local disruption of protein–protein interactions [163].",
            "Finally, recent studies have verified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in brain-derived exosomes, potentially enhancing their role in SARS-CoV-2 propagation and pathogenicity. Indeed, cargo profiling of neuron-derived EVs (NDEV) and astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEV) recovered from the plasma of COVID-19 patients revealed significantly higher levels of critical SARS-CoV-2 S1 and N proteins, in all COVID-19 affected subgroups compared to controls. Notably, mean ADEV and NDEV levels of N protein could be used to distinguish the group of patients who developed long COVID-19 with neuropsychiatric manifestations from the long COVID-19 group without such complications and the recovered COVID-19 patients without long COVID-19 [283]. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 spike-derived fragments were found to be efficiently exhibited in exosomes from recovered patients who had previously suffered from both mild and severe COVID-19 [284].",
            "In vitro investigations have demonstrated that DMV neurons are vulnerable to oxidative stress and that oxidative stress enhances intercellular α-syn propagation [331]. SARS-CoV-2 could exploit inflammatory exosomal cargo [306] to induce oxidative stress in the DMV, facilitate α-syn aggregation, and eventually promote post-COVID-19 parkinsonism through SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins. This hypothesis could be supported by the fact that both viral proteins have been shown to increase total α-syn and phosphorylation at Ser129 (pS129) levels [332], speed up the ability of endogenous α-syn to form amyloid fibrils [167], and ultimately induce LB-like pathology [332].",
            "Collectively, it is possible that the exosomal presence of these viral proteins illuminates connecting routes linking COVID-19 to PD. Given that SARS-CoV-2 viral components persist in exosomes during the acute and potentially the post-COVID-19 phase, one could reasonably hypothesize that the COVID-19-related exosomal cargo could act as a neurodegenerative promoter and probable elicitor of parkinsonism manifestation.",
            "Although the role of viruses in PD pathogenesis is still debated, various studies have found a link between viruses and parkinsonism, suggesting that they may operate as an initiating trigger of primary PD or secondary parkinsonism. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic led to the realization that elimination of the virus after recovery does not always signal the end of the disease, as many patients are burdened with post-COVID-19 manifestations. One of the great concerns of the medical community at this point is the likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 infection could lead to parkinsonism, a notion strongly supported by the PD-like symptoms observed in some patients during the acute or post-COVID-19 phase. Extending the hypothesis of post-COVID-19-induced parkinsonian phenotype, we present herein clinical, inflammatory, and molecular overlaps that have started to emerge and constitute a neurobiological connective network between these two diseases. Exosomes are key regulators of intercellular communication and have been shown to play a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases. SARS-CoV-2 manipulates exosomes, altering their cargo and, as a result, their function, so that they may serve as a vehicle for viral spread. In doing so, these SARS-CoV-2-related exosomes may efficiently transport SARS-CoV-2 genetic material and viral proteins from the periphery, being the gut or lungs, or other tissues, in the CNS via BBB crossing. SARS-CoV-2 related exosomes, in particular, can potentially transmit SARS-CoV-2 fragments, transcriptional factors, and inflammatory mediators to brain cells, resulting in prolonged neuroinflammation and α-syn aggregation, which collectively contribute to PD development or a possible deterioration in people with genetic predisposition towards PD. Visualization of the hypothetical role of SARS-CoV-2-related exosomes and their cargo in PD pathogenesis is depicted in (Figure 2). In conclusion, we postulate in this review that cargo analysis of SARS-CoV-2-related exosomes, especially brain-derived ones, could serve as a compass for delineating underlying virus-mediated pro-PD development mechanisms and for detecting the much-dreaded post-COVID-19 parkinsonism storm. To this end, experimental and clinical studies will be conducted to validate our hypothesis.",

            "A hypothetical quasi-infectious model of CNS proteopathic seeding, with SARS-CoV-2 as the model virus. At step 1, SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion can occur either as a primary event by infecting neurons, or following infection of non-neuronal cells, such as brain endothelial cells, olfactory epithelial cells, or cells from peripheral infected tissues. Successful infection either of non-neuronal cells (2) or neurons (3) could lead to the production of exosomes that could be transmitted transynaptically (3), or intercellularly (4). The quasi-infectious concept indicates that the exosomal cargo is pathogenic and may be enhanced by the presence of viral components (5). SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins could potentiate the formation of amyloid fibrils by endogenous α-syn in recipient cells. At the same time, exosomes could transmit α-syn to other brain cells in a “prion-like” mode. Exosomal immunomodulatory molecules could enhance neuroinflammatory processes in both neuronal and glia cells, while transcriptional regulators and miRNAs might activate intracellular signaling pathways and regulate gene transcription pertinent to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and other homeostatic cellular mechanisms. The ensuing microglial inflammatory phenotype turnover could enhance neuroinflammation further, resulting in enhanced neurodegeneration."

            "As of the 7th of July 2024, 775,754,322 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 7,053,902 deaths worldwide, had been reported to the WHO (World Health Organization). Nevertheless, untill the 15th of July 2024, a total of 13,578,710,228 vaccine doses had been administered, with almost no country spared from COVID-19 attacks. The pathophysiology of this virus is complicated, and several symptoms require a deep understanding of the actual mechanisms. It is unclear why some patients develop severe symptoms while others do not, although literature suggests a role for vitamin D. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in the infection or in ameliorating the severity of symptoms. The mechanism of action of vitamin D and vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is well understood. VDD is associated with increased hospitalization of severely ill patients and increased levels of COVID-19-caused mortality. Recent studies suggest that vitamin D levels and genetic variations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene significantly impact the severity and outcomes of COVID-19, especially in the infections caused by Delta and Omicron variants. Furthermore, VDD causes immune system dysregulation upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that vitamin D sufficiency is crucial in fighting against COVID-19 infection. The therapeutic effect of vitamin D raises interest in its potential role as a prophylactic and treatment adjunct. We evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D and its ability to enhance the efficacy of new antiviral drugs like molnupiravir and paxlovid against SARS-CoV-2. This review discusses the role of vitamin D sufficiency and VDD in COVID-19 initiation and progression, emphasizing the molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D exerts its actions as a proactive step for the next pandemic. However, there is still no clear evidence of vitamin D’s impact on prevention and treatment, leading to contradictory findings. Therefore, large-scale randomized trials are required to reach a definitive conclusion. A bibliometric analysis of publications related to vitamin D, immunity, and COVID-19 revealed a significant increase in research activity in this area, particularly in 2020–2024, underscoring the growing recognition of vitamin D’s potential role in the context of the pandemic.",

            "Coronaviruses are of four types: α, β, γ, and δ. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are β-coronaviruses. Genetic analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 shares an 89.1% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV, indicating a closer relationship than MERS-CoV (El-Hddad et al. 2024). SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that leads to COVID-19 disease. COVID-19 is a contagious disease presented by several clinical symptoms ranging from mild to potentially critical illness. Clinical manifestations include dry cough, shortness of breath, loss of smell and taste, bilateral viral pneumonia, muscle pain, fever, headache, acute respiratory distress syndromes, respiratory failure, and cytokine release syndrome (Meyerowitz et al. 2024). These symptoms range from flu-like to death (Hussain et al. 2020). COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic due to its high contagiousness, as well as worldwide morbidities and mortalities (Khan et al. 2020; Rehman et al. 2020), and no country has been spared from its onslaught. COVID-19 infections initiate an acute inflammatory response and oxidative stress, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death in the worst case (Las et al. 2020). Nearly 80 million cases have been affected by this virus, though the next pandemic will be less virulent due to the preparation actions employed; however, lessons regarding VDD should be learned.",
            "Even though it is not widely practiced, vitamin D has been proposed as one of the potential lines in preventing severe manifestations, bad prognosis, complications, and deaths from the disease (Brenner and Vitamin 2021). Vitamin D can be obtained from skin synthesis after solar UV-B exposure, diet, or supplementation (Zittermann et al. 2006). Vitamin D deficiency has been reported to be associated with respiratory tract infection (Barassi et al. 2021; Demir et al. 2021), although it is preventable by supplementation (Griffin et al. 2020). It is unclear why some patients develop severe symptoms upon contracting the infection of SARS-CoV-2 while others do not. Nonetheless, many reports have suggested vitamin D as a key factor in reducing the risk of either infection or developing severe symptoms (D’Avolio et al. 2020). Recent work has suggested a possible role of VDD in the dysregulation of cytokine production and inflammatory response as key complications of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, vitamin D can regulate the expression of several genes in the immune cells because of its nature as a steroid hormone (Griffin et al. 2020).",
            "This review summarizes the current knowledge about the role of VDD in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, emphasizing the molecular mechanism by which vitamin D exerts its functions. This would help in the awareness strategies to protect people from developing severe manifestations and complications from the viral infection in case we face an upcoming pandemic. Molnupiravir and Paxlovid have also recently gained attention due to their effectiveness in treating COVID-19. This article delves into the relationship between these drugs and vitamin D, a crucial nutrient with known immune-boosting properties. In addition, we will summarize current knowledge on the multifaceted role of vitamin D in preventing and treating COVID-19 and its variants.",
            "Vitamin D refers to a group of fat-soluble secosteroid hormones that play a vital role in regulating calcium and phosphate metabolism, bone health, and immune function (Christakos et al. 2011; Bishop et al. 2021). Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is the predominant form of vitamin D in humans and animals, characterized by a steroid backbone with four fused rings. Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), another variant of vitamin D, shares a tetracyclic ring system but differs in its side chain composition (Jäpelt and Jakobsen 2013; Norman 2008). In comparison, cholecalciferol possesses a characteristic secosteroid structure with a broken ring that allows conformational flexibility important for binding to the vitamin D receptor (Molnár et al. 2011; Norman 2006). The 2D and 3D structures of vitamin D2 and D3 are presented in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Overview of vitamin D structure and its structure–activity relationships (SARs). The most biologically active forms of vitamin D are vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) (A, B) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). C, D. Ergocalciferol has a chemical structure characterized by a steroidal backbone. Its 3D structure includes a tetracyclic ring system with a side chain. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is structurally similar to vitamin D2, but differs in the side chain. It also contains a steroidal backbone with a tetracyclic ring system",

            "Structure–activity relationship (SAR) analysis examines how modifications to the chemical structure of a compound influence its biological activity. For vitamin D, understanding SARs is key to elucidating its functions and enabling analog development for therapeutic applications (Mizwicki and Norman 2009). Inactive vitamin D undergoes activation reactions, becoming potent ligands for the target tissues’ vitamin D receptor (VDR) (Jones et al. 2012). Binding triggers effects on calcium/phosphate homeostasis, bone health, immunity, and cell growth (Haussler et al. 1997). Researchers have synthesized analogs with tailored side chain and ring alterations to selectively enhance the desired actions or reduce adverse effects (Etten and Mathieu 2005; Nagpal et al. 2005). This has enabled the creation of synthetic derivatives like calcitriol to treat osteoporosis (Molnár et al. 2006).",
            "The vitamin D scaffold, containing a broken secosteroid ring, flexible side chain, and cis-triene motif, presents specific binding groups to VDR in an optimal orientation (Norman 2008; Zhu et al. 2013). The A-ring 3-hydroxyl enables receptor binding, while the adjustable side chain allows fitting into VDR’s ligand pocket (Molnár et al. 2011; Sutton and MacDonald 2003). The cis-triene component contributes to shape and binding affinity (Norman 2008). Even minor modifications to these structures significantly impact vitamin D bioactivity (Mizwicki and Norman 2009; Bishop et al. 2021; Carlberg and Campbell 2013). Further insights into SARs will aid in harnessing the full therapeutic potential of vitamin D analogs.",
            "Vitamin D (cholecalciferol, C27 H44O) is an essential hormone for human health. It is a fat-soluble vitamin that can be synthesized in the skin after exposure to UV or from dietary sources. Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol (Holick et al. 1987; Crissey et al. 2003). 7-Dehydrocholesterol reacts with UVB at wavelengths between 290 and 315 nm present in sunlight. The epidermis of young and adult individuals is the major site of vitamin D synthesis, accounting for more than 80% of the total vitamin D synthesized in the skin (MacLaughlin and Holick 1985). Vitamin D is a prohormone that undergoes conversion to the active form, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D [1,25(OH)(2)D]. The active form of vitamin D interacts with its receptor, vitamin D receptor (VDR), to modulate the expression level of several genes associated with the biological responses (Dusso et al. 2005; Khazai et al. 2008). Recent reports indicated that maintaining optimal vitamin D at optimal levels is crucial in reducing the risk of several chronic (Matyjaszek-Matuszek et al. 2015) and infectious (Mercola et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2021) diseases.",
            "Vitamin D increases calcium levels to ensure a sufficient blood level (Wasserman 2004; Christakos et al. 2011). It also promotes calcium absorption within the small intestines (Christakos et al. 2011) and reabsorption in renal tubules, thereby decreasing calcium excretion (Veldurthy et al. 2016). Moreover, vitamin D increases the absorption of magnesium (Hardwick et al. 1991; Hodgkinson et al. 1979) and phosphorus (Welch et al. 2017) within the intestine.",
            "When obtained from food or synthesis in the skin, vitamin D undergoes two types of conversions within the human body (Fig. 2a, 1b). In the liver, with the aid of 25-hydroxylase, cholecalciferol undergoes conversion into 25-hydroxy cholecalciferol (25(OH)vitamin D). This compound circulates to the kidney, where it undergoes the second conversion with the aid of 1α-hydroxylase into 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (aka calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D) (Bikle 2014). As a steroid hormone, this active form binds to vitamin D receptors (VDRs) (Webb 2006), which are located in the nuclei of target cells (Malloy et al. 2009), whereby the expression and repression of the different genes take place (Pike and Meyer 2010; Valdivielso 2009).Fig. 2The general role of vitamin D in immune system modulation. A The synthesis of vitamin D by either diet or exposure to UV-B. The provitamin is converted in macrophage into the active form of vitamin D via 1α-hydroxylase. The active form of vitamin D then induces the expression of cathelicidins and β-defensins from macrophages that help fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Finally, macrophages represent the S-peptide of the virus to naïve T cells. B Naïve T cells are matured to Th2 in the presence of vitamin D and finally to plasma cells that produce specific antibodies against S-peptide. In the case of VDD, naïve T cells are matured to Th1 (the bad pathway), which produces a cytokine storm",

            "Vitamin D controls the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) by inhibiting the release of renin from the kidney, thus decreasing the levels of angiotensin I (AT-I) and then AT-II (Las et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2017) (Fig. 3). This inhibition favors the conversion of AT-I into AT (1–7), which inhibits inflammation and increases vasodilation in the lung (Gorman et al. 2017), maintaining the lung cells integrity. Moreover, vitamin D increases the ratio of ACE2 to ACE, which mediates the hydrolysis of angiotensin II and reduces the inflammatory response and lung injury (Rhodes et al. 2021a). Generally, vitamin D deficiency in patients (especially men, as the RAS system is X-linked) increases the activity of RAS. It renders them more susceptible to cytokine storm, one of the hall clinical marks of COVID-19 (Benskin 2020).Fig. 3The role of vitamin D in regulating ACE2. The liver produces angiotensinogen converted to angiotensin I by renin (from the kidney). AT-I is converted to AT-II by ACE1 (from the lungs). In the absence of vitamin D, AT-II is converted to ATR, which leads to inflammation, vasoconstriction, and fibrosis of the lungs. SARS-CoV-2 inhibits AT-II and promotes the ATR pathway. Meanwhile, in the presence of vitamin D, AT-II is converted to angiotensin (1–7), which reduces lung inflammation and fibrosis to keep the lungs intact",

            "Vitamin D is a fat-soluble prohormone, and its deficiency is associated with many health-related issues (Kheiri et al. 2018). VDD can impair mitochondrial functions and trigger oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Vitamin sufficiency reduces oxidative stress and improves mitochondrial and endocrine functions (Wimalawansa and Vitamin 2019). Vitamin D receptors are present in different tissues, necessitating a deep understanding of its other potential biological functions (Judd and Tangpricha 2009).",
            "Vitamin D has demonstrated immune system modulation (Prietl et al. 2013), influencing innate and adaptive immunity (Bilezikian et al. 2020). Research indicates its ability to suppress the synthesis of various cytokines, including IL-6 (Zhang et al. 2012) (Fig. 4). Thus, VDD is associated with the severity of different diseases, including COVID-19 (Kow et al. 2020; Speeckaert and Delanghe 2020). Several reports have indicated that vitamin D deficiency impairs the innate immune system, and the patients who suffer from this deficiency are more vulnerable to COVID-19 (Benskin 2020). Therefore, maintaining an optimal vitamin D level appears crucial for ameliorating the severity of the disease (Yisak et al. 2021).Fig. 4The initiation of the cytokine storm. Without vitamin D, the immune system goes into a bad pathway in which a storm of several cytokines is produced. Macrophages are the main immune cells that produce these cytokines, including IL-1, IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, and CXCL. This cytokine storm affects several organs, including, but not limited to, the lung, kidney, heart, and liver. The liver accordingly releases CRP, ferritin, D-mimer, and fibrinogen, the main parameters of COVID-19 infections",

            "VDD is associated with an elevation in the level of inflammatory cytokines, which increases the risk of viral upper respiratory tract infections (Barker et al. 2014; Meckel et al. 2016; Weir et al. 2020). Therefore, vitamin D supplementation can reduce the cytokine storm that signifies some of the most serious consequences of COVID-19 (Bilezikian et al. 2020). This catastrophic amount of cytokines released from the liver that includes IL1, IL-8, chemokines, TNF-α, and IL-6 (Ahmed 2020) affects blood vessels by increasing the risk of thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and inflammation, along with the elevated level of ROS (Rhodes et al. 2021b) (Fig. 5).Fig. 5The effect of CRP on blood vessels. When the level of CRP, generated by the liver, increases, it affects the blood vessels through increasing atherosclerosis inflammation and elevated levels of ROS, increasing the likelihood of thrombosis",

            "Furthermore, vitamin D can reduce the risk and seriousness of SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking viral replication directly (Farid et al. 2021) and promoting the production of cathelicidins (Greulich et al. 2017) and β-defensins (Watts et al. 2020) from macrophages as well as reducing IL-6 production (Miroliaee et al. 2018). These proteins can disrupt the viral phospholipid bilayer and cleave the viral peptide via proteolytic action. Furthermore, cathelicidins trigger vascular permeability, causing the blood vessels to leak out more macrophages at the site of virus accumulation. Generally, these two antimicrobial proteins increase the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines that induce inflammation and lung injuries, the leading cause of pneumonia (Grant et al. 2020). Vitamin D can also help accelerate the healing process of the affected lung areas (Mohan et al. 2020).",
            "Vitamin D is recognized for its immunomodulatory properties, enhancing innate immune responses while suppressing excessive inflammation and cytokine storms associated with severe COVID-19 (Christakos et al. 2011; Holick 2007). Observational studies demonstrate an association between vitamin D deficiency (< 20 ng mL−1) and increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity (Hossein-nezhad and Holick 2013). Small clinical trials reveal that high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation (e.g., 60,000 IU weekly) in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients rapidly normalizes vitamin D levels and may reduce hospital stay (Manson et al. 2016; Kennel et al. 2010). The mechanisms by which vitamin D may impact COVID-19 pathogenesis include modulating inflammatory cytokine production, stimulating antimicrobial peptides, regulating the renin–angiotensin system, and tempering the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 is an innate immune receptor that promotes inflammation when excessively activated. By modulating NLRP3, vitamin D may counter the inflammatory pathology in COVID-19 (Christakos et al. 2011; Malabanan et al. 1998). While vitamin D deficiency correlates with worse outcomes, further research is required to establish causality and the therapeutic efficacy of vitamin D supplementation as an adjunctive treatment for COVID-19.",
            "The role of vitamin D in influencing the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 infection has been an area of active investigation. Recent studies have shed light on the potential interactions between vitamin D status and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. A longitudinal cohort study on the Omicron BA.2 subvariant in children found that those with vitamin D insufficiency had worse clinical outcomes than those with sufficient vitamin D levels (Peng et al. 2022). Mamurova et al. discovered a significant link between variations in the VDR gene and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 variants (Mamurova et al. 2023). This connection implies that genetic differences in VDR might contribute to the varying responses seen among different SARS-CoV-2 strains.",
            "In a longitudinal real-world cohort study, Huang et al. focused on vitamin D levels’ impact on COVID-19 pneumonia caused by the Delta variant (Huang et al. 2023). Their findings indicated that individuals deficient in vitamin D tended to experience quicker disease progression, slower recovery, and more pronounced inflammatory markers in their pneumonia compared to those with adequate vitamin D levels. Specifically, those with insufficient vitamin D showed elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 and procalcitonin, along with delayed viral clearance, as evidenced by higher cycle threshold values for viral gene targets. Likewise, another real-world cohort study focusing on adults infected with the Delta variant showed a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and more severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These observations underscore the potential role of vitamin D in influencing the development and clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in the context of evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants.",
            "Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D may play a crucial role in modulating immune responses and clinical outcomes, particularly with more immune-evasive variants like Omicron and Delta, compared to earlier variants. However, further research is essential to understand the specific mechanisms involved and to determine optimal vitamin D levels for reducing severe outcomes across different lineages of SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Recent studies have indicated an inverse association between VDD and an elevated mortality rate in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Annweiler et al. 2020; Singh et al. 2020a; Panagiotou et al. 2020). Thus, a great interest has recently been raised regarding vitamin D protective and therapeutic role in COVID-19. Reports indicated that very low 25(OH)vitamin D levels (< 10 ng mL−1) were highly prevalent and suggestive of deficiency among hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients (Camargo and Martineau 2020). In comparison, low 25(OH) vitamin D levels (< 20–≥ 10 ng mL−1) were not associated with the outcome variables (Cereda et al. 2020). Therefore, to decrease the risk of contracting a new infection, it is recommended for people at high risk of COVID-19 to take 10,000 IU d−1 of vitamin D for a few weeks, followed by 5000 IU d−1 to raise the concentrations of the active form of vitamin D. For those who became infected, elevated doses of vitamin D is recommended (Grant et al. 2020). In addition, vitamin D can protect against ARDS, the main death-causing complication of COVID-19 (Abraham et al. 2021). Moreover, seven out of nine studies reviewed by Yisak et al. (2021) have indicated a crucial role in vitamin D status in COVID-19 infection, prognosis, and mortality. For example, in a study involving 7807 participants, where 782 were COVID‐19 positive and 7025 were COVID‐19 negative, the plasma level of vitamin D was significantly lower in the positive group (19.00 ng mL−1) compared with the negative group (20.55 ng mL−1) (Merzon et al. 2020).",
            "On the contrary, a retrospective analysis by Mbata et al. found no association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity (Mbata et al. 2023). However, the retrospective design limits causal inference, and the study has many limitations, including vitamin D dosage and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level measurements that may differ among the included patients. Moreover, Domazet Bugarin et al. conducted a single center underpowered randomized trial of vitamin D supplementation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, suggesting that there was no benefit in vitamin D supplementation to patients with severe COVID-19 disease admitted to the ICU and in need of respiratory support (Domazet Bugarin et al. 2023). While they found no difference in clinical outcomes, the sample size was small (n = 75 per group). This study was underpowered to detect a 2-day difference in respiratory support. The study was originally powered for 137 patients per group. Lastly, Seely et al. performed an underpowered double-blind randomized trial of vitamin C, D, zinc, and vitamin K supplementation versus placebo for 21 days in 90 outpatients with COVID-19 (46 control, 44 treatment) (Dugald et al. 2023). Due to the small sample size, lack of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level measurements, and participant-related limitations relevant to this study, the statistical power was significantly reduced. Additionally, due to a lack of recruitment and a low compliance rate, it was difficult to reach a definitive conclusion on the effectiveness of these nutrients.",
            "Nevertheless, the currently available data regarding vitamin D’s protective role is unclear and has conflicting results (Farid et al. 2021; Pereira et al. 2020; Orchard et al. 2021); thus, large,randomized studies are needed to attain a clear conclusion.",
            "Patients suffering from any form of vitamin D deficiency are at increased risk of getting COVID-19. These groups include the following.",
            "COVID-19 affects all age groups, with the elderly (older than 65 years of age) being affected more severely (Shahid et al. 2020; Dhama et al. 2020), and they are more susceptible to developing serious clinical symptoms with higher mortality rates (Barros et al. 2021). The obvious higher rates of mortality in the elderly compared with young patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is in part attributed to impairment in the response in older patients (Kadambari et al. 2020; Perrotta et al. 2020). This immune system weakness is partly due to vitamin D deficiency (Benskin 2020; Hribar et al. 2020), and the scenario worsens in the presence of other co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases, among others (Kumar et al. 2021). Cellular- and immuno-senescence may trigger viral-induced cytokine storm with subsequent life-threatening complications. (Perrotta et al. 2020; Nehme et al. 2020).",
            "Cytokine storm is one of the hallmarks of COVID-19 in older adults, and it happens due to a systemic increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines induce acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, and multiple organ failure. It is assumed that a mild to moderate elevation of local and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines is characterized by inflammaging (Meftahi et al. 2020), the status at which various pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced as an age-associated biological phenomenon. A study by Baktash et al. demonstrated that COVID-19-positive patients have lower levels of serum 25(OH)D level (27 nmol L−1) compared with those COVID-19 negative (52 nmol L−1) (p = 0.0008) (Baktash et al. 2020). Vitamin D has been proposed as a key controller of the inflammatory response, mitochondrial respiration, and ROS production; therefore, it is associated with aging. For example, it reduces the inflammatory response by maintaining optimal levels of Ca+ and ROS (Berridge 2017).",
            "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most reported co-morbidities associated with the severity of COVID-19 (Singh et al. 2020b). Patients with DM are at increased risk of having severe complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is estimated that 20–50% of COVID-19-positive patients had comorbid diabetes (Bornstein et al. 2020). Furthermore, epidemiological studies indicate that poorly controlled diabetic patients are most likely to be hospitalized because of bacterial, fungal, and/or viral infections (Erener 2020). Thus, a comprehensive understanding of how diabetes deteriorates the prognosis of COVID-19 and how this viral infection also worsens hyperglycemia in diabetic patients is crucial in tailoring customized treatments for better clinical management of these patients (Pal and Bhadada 2020).",
            "Several outcomes characterize DM, such as a weakened immune system, high level of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and downregulation of ACE2. These features contribute to worsening the prognosis of COVID-19 and predispose patients to severe complications that include coagulopathy, vasculopathy, and psychological stress. On the other hand, cytokine-induced insulin resistance, low levels of calcium, and β-cell damage via dysregulation of ACE2 in the pancreas, which leads to inflammatory responses, are major contributors to the bad prognosis of diabetes. Many clinical studies indicated the association between VDD and COVID-19; a high percentage of these reports showed that VDD is also associated with diabetes (Weir et al. 2020).",
            "Insulin resistance is a hallmark in DM type II, where β-cells secrete more insulin to overcome this resistance and thus prevent the elevation of the blood glucose. Hypersecretion of insulin leads to calcification of B-cells, and ROS signaling results in cell death. VDD has been linked to the onset of DM, contributing to insulin resistance (Berridge 2017; Mezza et al. 2012).",
            "VDD has been proposed to have a role in insulin resistance, where it is associated with polymorphism in different genes, including VDR receptor, vitamin D-binding protein, and vitamin D 1 alpha-hydroxylase. Furthermore, VDD can regulate immune functions via activating innate and adaptive immunity, producing different types of cytokines, activating NFκB, and inducing TNFα. VDD’s effects increase the risk of insulin resistance (Sung et al. 2012).",
            "DNA methylation is a well-known epigenetic mechanism that fundamentally participates in the regulation of gene expression. It is generally accepted that vitamin D can regulate DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and microRNA generation to maintain normal biological functions (Zhou et al. 2015). Several studies have indicated the association between vitamin D and the level of DNA methylation in different genes (Ong et al. 2020). Some diabetes-related genes are epigenetically regulated through hypermethylation of their promoter regions. Vitamin D has been associated with this regulation by preventing hypermethylation via upregulating DMA demethylases, whose function is to prevent the methylation of several diabetes-related genes. Nevertheless, there is a mutuality between the vitamin D system and epigenetic mechanisms, where they regulate each other (Snegarova and Naydenova 2020).",
            "On the other hand, several vitamin D-related genes, such as VDR, CYP2R1, CYP24A1, and CYP27B1, possess CpG stretches in their promoters and hence can be regulated by DNA methylation (Szymczak-Pajor et al. 2020). Furthermore, VDR protein can interact with different chromatin modifiers such as HMTs, HATs, and HDACs. VDR can also target lysine-specific demethylase (LSD) and HDMs of the Jumonji C (JmjC)-domain, given that VDR has DNA demethylating properties (Fetahu et al. 2014).",
            "Obesity triggers chronic inflammation, VDD, and causes mechanical compression of the lungs, which increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complications (Cuschieri and Grech 2020). Since vitamin D is a fat-soluble steroid, the adipose tissue can retain and attract vitamin D, lowering its level in the bloodstream. A low level of the active form of vitamin D leads to the synthesis of more AT-II that binds to the AT receptor. The latter is responsible for lung damage via increasing the inflammatory response and vasoconstriction. Furthermore, the lower vitamin D level directs the differentiation of T Naïve cells into Th1 (the bad pathway), which ultimately results in the cytokine storm, the characterizing phenomenon of COVID-19.",
            "Recent reports have linked VDD with obesity and COVID-19 severity. Evidence indicates a target level of vitamin D of 50 nmol L−1, and to reach this level, it is recommended to supplement patients with 800 IU d−1 (not 400 IU/day as currently recommended in the UK) (Griffin et al. 2020).",
            "As COVID-19 continues its journey across the world, it becomes obvious that its morbidity and mortality rates vary from one nation to the other (Sidiropoulou et al. 2021), indicating that ethnicity might have a role. Considering that skin color—among other factors—can modulate vitamin D levels, melanin is involved in the severity of infection in different populations (Sidiropoulou et al. 2021; Richard et al. 2017). During the COVID-19 pandemic, higher fatality rates were corresponding to VDD rates (Benskin 2020). Earlier reports indicated that Blacks and Hispanics have lower levels of vitamin D compared with Whites (Gutiérrez et al. 2011), and recently, (Mercola et al. 2020) indicated that dark skin color and VDD are features of severe COVID-19 disease. The increased mortality rate among Blacks, who have a reduced UV-B absorption ability, is comparable with the low level of vitamin D. It is now well established that VDD is associated with elevated rates of COVID-19 mortality (Abraham et al. 2021). It has been indicated that African Americans have a 15- to 20-fold higher prevalence of severe VDD than Europeans (Ames et al. 2021). For example, a study involving 110 healthy older African American women found that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) is lower in women with darker skin color compared with Whites (Gallagher et al. 2013). Another study involving 208 individuals with a mean age of 59.1 years reported that Blacks had lower total 25(OH)D concentrations (20.3 ng mL−1) than Whites (26.7 ng mL−1) in the USA (Alzaman et al. 2016).",
            "Furthermore, several reports showed that a relatively higher COVID-19 mortality rate is observed in the Northern Hemisphere, with an increase of 4.4% in the mortality for each 1° latitude to the North, considering age. This finding supports the role of UV-B and vitamin D levels (Rhodes et al. 2021a; Chandran et al. 2020).",
            "Several studies have investigated the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and heart failure. It was indicated that vitamin D improved health-related quality of life and CRP levels (Wang et al. 2019). Furthermore, vitamin D decreases serum levels of inflammatory markers in heart failure patients. However, elevated serum vitamin D levels did not reduce cardiac disease-related mortality. Anemia and VDD are common features in chronic heart failure. In a study conducted by Małyszko et al. (2019), 116 CHF and valvular disease patients were enrolled to investigate the levels of vitamin D, VDBP, hemoglobin, and serum creatinine. They found that the prevalence of anemia was 22%, and vitamin D levels were lowest in the valvular disease group. A similar profile has been shown in vitamin D binding protein. Moreover, valvular disease is associated with VDD (Małyszko et al. 2019).",
            "CHF patients suffer from VDD because of their sedentary lifestyle and low outdoor activities, where sunlight is the main source of vitamin D. Furthermore, this deficiency, as indicated by a recent case–control study, is attributed to lack of exposure to UV-B during the early stages of their life (childhood and adolescence) (Zittermann et al. 2006).",
            "Screening for vitamin D deficiency is recommended for high-risk individuals, including those with malabsorption disorders, kidney/liver disease, obesity, dark skin pigmentation, and inadequate sun exposure (LeFevre 2015); routine screening is not recommended for healthy adults under 50 years old. However, screening can be considered for those with multiple risk factors (Holick et al. 2011). Older adults (over 65 years) should be screened for VDD due to age-related declines in cutaneous synthesis and intestinal absorption (Kennel et al. 2010).",
            "The diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, determined by serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels, is considered the most accurate indicator of vitamin D status (Kennel et al. 2010):Levels below 12 ng/mL indicate severe deficiency.Levels between 12 and 20 ng/mL suggest deficiency, with treatment recommended for levels below 30 ng/mL (Holick et al. 2011).The optimal levels are 30–60 ng/mL, with a recommended prophylactic dose (Rosen et al. 2012).",

            "The recommended daily vitamin D doses vary by age (Manson et al. 2016): (1) Infants (0–1 years): 400 IU/day (10 mcg) of cholecalciferol, equivalent to four drops (400 IU) daily of liquid vitamin D; (2) children (> 1 year): 600 IU (15 mcg) of cholecalciferol, equivalent to six drops (600 IU) daily; (3) children (> 8 years) half an adult dose of vitamin D drops daily, and (4) adults: the recommended prophylactic dose is either one full adult dose (600–800 IU/day) of vitamin D drops or 2000 IU of cholecalciferol in tablet form daily (Manson et al. 2016; Malabanan et al. 1998; Ish-Shalom et al. 2008).",

The treatment can be administered via various routes and regimens:Oral cholecalciferol (vitamin D3): 50,000 IU once weekly for 8 weeks (Malabanan et al. 1998).Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2): 50,000 IU once weekly for 8 weeks (Malabanan et al. 1998).Injectable cholecalciferol: 200,000 IU administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously once a month for 2 months (Ish-Shalom et al. 2008).",

Maintenance doses are typically lower than treatment doses, ranging from 800 to 2000 IU/day for adults (Institute of Medicine Committee to Review Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin D, Calcium 2011). Regular sun exposure and dietary vitamin D intake also help to maintain vitamin D levels within the normal range.",
            "Vitamin D toxicity is rare, but can occur from extremely high doses over long periods. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and kidney problems (Hathcock et al. 2007). Serum 25(OH)vitamin D levels consistently over 150 ng mL−1 indicate toxicity (Jones 2008). Routine toxicity monitoring is unnecessary for doses under 10,000 IU/day (Vieth 1999).",
            "Patient education on treatment duration and compliance is crucial, with an emphasis on adhering to the prescribed treatment regimen for a duration of 2 months. Afterward, a transition to maintenance prophylactic doses (e.g., 1000 IU vitamin D tablet daily) is advised.",
            "Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin; therefore, it is advisable to take supplements with a meal rich in fat to optimize absorption (Mulligan and Licata 2010).Enough sun exposure is recommended to avoid potential adverse effects, and tanning beds should be limited (Gambichler et al. 2002). It is recommended to have serum vitamin D levels reassessed within 3–4 months after initiating treatment (Kennel et al. 2010).",
            "Various medications can influence vitamin D levels. For example, antiepileptic drugs like phenytoin and carbamazepine may accelerate vitamin D metabolism, leading to lower serum levels. Glucocorticoids can impair vitamin D metabolism and decrease calcium absorption, thus adversely affecting vitamin D Levels in serum. Additionally, drugs that alter gastrointestinal absorption, such as orlistat, may reduce vitamin D absorption in diet from the intestines. Moreover, the oral solution should be stored at a temperature not exceeding 30 °C and must be protected from exposure to light to ensure its stability and effectiveness (Brown and Josse 2002).",
            "Molnupiravir is the orally bioavailable prodrug of N4-hydroxycytidine, a ribonucleoside analog that induces viral mutagenesis. It is metabolized into the active N4-hydroxycytidine triphosphate form, which competes with natural cytidine during SARS-CoV-2 replication, causing mutations in the viral genome that accumulate to the point of viral suppression (Niraj et al. 2022). Molnupiravir was granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2021 for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in high-risk adults (FDA 2021a). The drug is developed and marketed by Merck & Co.",
            "Paxlovid is an oral antiviral combining nirmatrelvir, a 3CL protease inhibitor, with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor for pharmacokinetic boosting. By blocking the 3CL protease enzyme essential for viral replication, nirmatrelvir suppresses SARS-CoV-2 propagation (Owen et al. 2021). Paxlovid obtained EUA from the FDA in December 2021 and is authorized for the treatment of mild–moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients aged ≥ 12 years and weighing ≥ 40kg (FDA 2021b). Pfizer and BioNTech jointly developed it.",
            "Vitamin D is known for its immunomodulatory effects, including the enhancement of innate antiviral immunity and the modulation of inflammation (Arboleda and Urcuqui-Inchima 2020). Observational studies have linked vitamin D deficiency to an increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections (Martineau et al. 2019). Though not a direct antiviral itself, vitamin D may provide synergistic benefits when combined with direct-acting antivirals by optimizing the immune response against SARS-CoV-2. However, clinical assessment is required to evaluate vitamin D as an immunomodulatory adjunct to molnupiravir and paxlovid for COVID-19 treatment.",

            "In the rapidly evolving field of COVID-19 research, bibliometric analysis has become an invaluable tool for mapping and classifying key aspects of scientific literature. This analysis is particularly useful for examining the complex relationships between vitamin D, immunity, and COVID-19. To provide a comprehensive overview, we conducted a bibliometric analysis using the Google Scholar platform, focusing on publications related to (“vitamin D” or “cholecalciferol”) and (“COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2”) and (immunity or immune). Figure 6 presents a profile of the current status of studies in this field. The data indicates a steady increase in publications related to these search terms over the years, reflecting a growing interest and activity in this research area. The analysis encompasses annual cumulative publications, including research articles, reviews, editorial material, and letters.Fig. 6Trends in publications on vitamin D and immunity in COVID-19 research from 2019 to 2024.

This visual representation helps understand the trends and focus areas within the research landscape.",
            "Initially, Google Scholar was used to get a broad overview and estimate the total volume of research. Then, the Web of Science was used for detailed bibliometric analysis, providing precise and curated data essential for in-depth research insights. This approach combines a broad initial view with detailed analysis, similar to methods used in related studies (Tony and Nabwey 2024). A bibliometric analysis was performed using the Web of Science core collection to provide a comprehensive overview of the research on vitamin D and immunity in the context of COVID-19. The search items were (“vitamin D” or “cholecalciferol”) and (“COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2”) and (immunity or immune). Subsequently, the data revealed from the “Web of Science Core Collection” database and the VOS viewer software (version 1.6.20) were extracted from 2019 to August 2024. Data was exported in BibTeX format, including titles, abstracts, keywords, authors, publication years, journal names, and citation counts. This data was analyzed using VOS viewer software, which employs co-occurrence analysis, clustering, and network visualization algorithms. Key features include overlay and density visualizations representing term relationships and research focus areas. The purpose of the design is to analyze the keywords of the research articles. The designed mapping incorporates a network. Then, the overlay and density visualization mapping are designed using this software. The current search is based on the co-occurrence associated with authors’ keywords and is designated the minimum occurrence number.",
            "Consequently, the software adjusts the parameters, and the mapping is designed. The most common feature of the VOS viewer is overlay visualizations, which are used to categorize density visualization over periods. The cited research articles on vitamin D and immunity in COVID-19 research showed that the bibliometric mapping of clusters could be identified as seen in Fig. 7. The hotspot clusters can demonstrate the intensive research studies based on the analyzed results attained via the data from “Web of Science” core collection from the search terms (“vitamin D” or “cholecalciferol”) and (“COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2”) and (immunity OR immune).Fig. 7Network visualization of key terms in vitamin D and immunity research related to COVID-19.

Correction of VDD with high-dose supplements in infected patients may provide synergistic benefits with antiviral therapy, leading to improved outcomes. Reviewing the influence of VDD on COVID-19 pathophysiology and vitamin D’s molecular mechanisms would raise awareness and inform strategies to protect people from developing severe complications in case of future pandemics. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are still needed to understand better if VDD is a modifiable risk factor for COVID-19 outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are also needed to establish vitamin D as an adjuvant to antivirals for COVID-19 prevention and treatment. The available mechanistic and epidemiological data suggest that maintaining adequate vitamin D levels may potentially benefit the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, but supplementation cannot yet be recommended based on current evidence alone. Monitoring population vitamin D levels and correcting deficiency remain prudent public health strategies at this time.",

            "SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a spectrum of acute neurological syndromes. A subset of these syndromes promotes higher in-hospital mortality than is predicted by traditional parameters defining critical care illness. This suggests that deregulation of components of the central and peripheral nervous systems compromises the interplay with systemic cellular, tissue and organ interfaces to mediate numerous atypical manifestations of COVID-19 through impairments in organismal homeostasis. This unique dyshomeostasis syndrome involves components of the ACE-2/1 lifecycles, renin-angiotensin system regulatory axes, integrated nervous system functional interactions and brain regions differentially sculpted by accelerated evolutionary processes and more primordial homeostatic functions. These biological contingencies suggest a mechanistic blueprint to define long-term neurological sequelae and systemic manifestations such as premature aging phenotypes, including organ fibrosis, tissue degeneration and cancer. Therapeutic initiatives must therefore encompass innovative combinatorial agents, including repurposing FDA-approved drugs targeting components of the autonomic nervous system and recently identified products of SARS-CoV-2-host interactions.",
            "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a systemic disease that impacts multiple organ systems and is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus (Zhu et al., 2020). Like some other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus that has likely jumped from animal species to humans. The potential rapid viral evolution that occurs by transitioning between poorly defined intermediate hosts may engender novel forms of pathogen-host interactions (Zhang and Holmes, 2020). Moreover, the human central nervous system has also undergone accelerated evolutionary innovations in the hominid-to-human lineage (Mattick and Mehler, 2008; Qureshi and Mehler, 2012, 2014). While these evolutionary mechanisms have facilitated rapid change in the human neocortex, other areas of the brain involved in more caudal midline homeostatic functions, which are often also preferential viral targets, represent more primordial evolutionary centers. The interplay between the potential rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and regions of the human brain that have experienced rapid and differential evolution like the neocortex may be a mechanism underlying the unique profiles of damage caused by SARS-CoV-2.",
            "It is increasingly evident that SARS-CoV-2 is not only neurotropic, but is associated with a much broader spectrum of acute and atypical neurological syndromes and manifestations than prior infections, particularly those involving β-coronaviruses (Bohmwald et al., 2018; Desforges et al., 2019; Ellul et al., 2020; Iadecola et al., 2020; Koralnik and Tyler, 2020; Paterson et al., 2020). Severe acute neurological events observed in COVID-19 have included ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, diffuse encephalopathy, encephalitis and neuromuscular disorders (Alquisiras-Burgos et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; MacLean et al., 2020; Conklin et al., 2021). Neurocognitive symptoms and dysfunction of various severities have also become increasingly recognized as potential consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Levine et al., 2020; Graham et al., 2021; Taquet et al., 2021). The occurrence of severe neurologic dysfunction suggests that less obvious neuropathologic processes are likely present among patients who do not exhibit overt neurologic disease but may exhibit differential degrees of systemic involvement. This raises the important question of the potential mechanistic interrelationships between nervous system and systemic homeostasis in mediating the pathogenesis and progression of COVID-19.",
            "In recent large acute retrospective incidence studies, higher in-hospital mortality has been associated with the early presence of a subset of neurological syndromes seen with COVID-19 (Eskandar et al., 2020; Chou et al., 2021). The most commonly observed central nervous system manifestations included stroke, encephalopathy, seizures and neuro-COVID-19 complex (Chou et al., 2021). These neurological complications were observed in 82% of hospitalized patients (Chou et al., 2021). Among these manifestations, altered arousal, orientation, attention, concentration (encephalopathy) and stroke conferred a significantly higher risk of mortality, independent of overall disease severity measures as assessed by a novel integrative COVID-19 severity rating scale (Altschul et al., 2020). These observations suggest that the nervous system writ large plays a preeminent role in the course and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "In this review, we provide emerging evidence that SARS-CoV-2 targets widely distributed components of the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS, respectively). We propose that disruption of cardinal homeostatic mechanisms mediated by the CNS and PNS give rise to the spectrum of unanticipated, novel, and multifactorial somatic organ, tissue and cellular damage observed in COVID-19. These include often severe and frequently broad-based end-organ dysfunction, and biologically complex forms of vasculopathy, coagulopathy, hypoxemia and immune deregulation and systemic inflammation amongst other systemic and life-threatening complications (Perico et al., 2020; Nie et al., 2021). We postulate that SARS-CoV-2-induced deregulation of the central and peripheral nervous systems subvert cardinal systemic homeostatic functions through interference amongst dynamic neural and systemic organ, tissue and cellular interfaces and SARS-CoV-2-mediated cellular signaling pathways, modulatory interactions and associated multidimensional effector networks (Qureshi and Mehler, 2013; Figure 1). Characterizing such intricate nervous system-systemic crosstalk and associated viral-host evolutionary adaptations is therefore essential for identifying novel measures to address the morbidity and mortality of the acute and critical care illness as well as the long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "Several mechanisms by which the human neocortex has undergone accelerated evolution have been elucidated (Figure 2). These innovations in regional nervous system form and function may promote higher-order cognitive and behavioral repertoires while simultaneously enhancing the vulnerability for age-related human brain disorders such as degenerative dementias and accelerated aging phenotypes (Mattick and Mehler, 2008). For example, numerous transcription factors interact with cis-acting genomic elements such as enhancers and super-enhancers to control the gene expression of the human forebrain (Nord et al., 2015). Degrees of adenosine to inosine RNA editing (Mehler and Mattick, 2007) of transcripts and proximal promoter associated regions with higher levels of chromatin interactivity are also enriched for human-specific genes (Song et al., 2020). Additionally, the emergence of individual human-specific genes such as NOTCH2NL, SRGAP2, TBC1D3, and ARHGAP11B may be central to increased gyrification and to the preferential activation of basal progenitors, which are thought to give rise to an expansion of the population of human neocortical neurons and to contribute to a greater sophistication of neural network connections and functional properties (Florio et al., 2015; Ju et al., 2016; Rincic et al., 2016; Fiddes et al., 2018). The expansion of the human neocortex has also been linked to evolutionary changes in neural stem cells forming the outer subventricular zone (Lui et al., 2011) and to a delay in the neuroepithelial cell differentiation process (Benito-Kwiecinski et al., 2021).",

            "Current studies generally agree that SARS-CoV-2 likely emerged via zoonotic spillover first from bats (Lei and Zhang, 2020; Hedman et al., 2021). Other mammals have been proposed as intermediate hosts; for example, minks are susceptible to natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and can transmit the virus to humans (Hedman et al., 2021), and mutational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domains suggests that increased human susceptibility may emerge in pangolins (Lei and Zhang, 2020; Li et al., 2020a). These contingencies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits novel evolutionary trajectories, responds to selective pressures, generates genomic innovations and gives rise to innate immune dysregulation, thereby promoting greater transmissibility and more complex and interrelated clinical syndromes (Zeberg and Paabo, 2020; Zhang and Holmes, 2020). Modifications in SARS-CoV-2 cellular tropism elicit deregulated and more severe and atypical nervous system and systemic pathologies in the acute phase of illness and the contextual alterations to give rise to long-term neural and systemic sequelae (Jacob et al., 2020; Pellegrini et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 therefore dramatically modifies the host-mediated transcriptome and epitranscriptome, long-distance molecular signaling pathways, profiles of multi-organ cellular involvement, activation of premature aging pathways, and regenerative responses that define acute COVID-19 infection (Kim et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020; Delorey et al., 2021). Such systemic consequences and pathogenic mechanisms give rise to a plethora of imbalanced immunological and inflammatory reactions that sculpt disease progression, severity and the trajectory of clinical inflection points (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Lucas et al., 2020; Meckiff et al., 2020; Su et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Rodda et al., 2021). Moreover, the exceptional versatility of the lifecycle of the ACE2 receptor, SARS-CoV-2 molecular constituents, entry factors, functional adaptations and downstream signaling axes help to ensure rapid and efficient environmental innovations including linking targeted co-morbidities to cardinal viral-host mediated signaling pathways, age- and gender-dependent disease phenotypes and seminal evolutionary mechanisms, including formation of novel ACE2 isoforms through co-option of intronic retroelements as promoters and alternative exons (Anand et al., 2020; Konno et al., 2020; Maremanda et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b).",
            "SARS-CoV-2 infects the nervous system (NS) through multiple points of entry, leading to the severity and unique characteristics of systemic involvement of the virus in mediating cumulative disease burden and excessive morbidity and frequently mortality. The nervous system is composed of the CNS and the PNS. The PNS is further divided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The autonomic nervous system is then segregated into the parasympathetic, sympathetic, and enteric divisions. These PNS pathways provide important communication routes to systemic organs, tissues and cell types and their molecular effectors for also defining NS viral tropism (Qureshi and Mehler, 2013; Shahriari et al., 2020; Zahalka and Frenette, 2020).",
            "Other coronaviruses have been known to directly invade the brainstem (Porzionato et al., 2020), where the presence of the major receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), has been documented. Previous studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may spread to the CNS directly, by invasion through the cribriform plate into the olfactory epithelium and olfactory tract (Baig et al., 2020). The olfactory bulb has direct neuronal connections to the amygdala, entorhinal area, and hippocampus (Serrano et al., 2021). Additionally, a recent neuro-anatomical study of patients who died with COVID-19 found that 20% of patients studied had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in one or more regions of the CNS, including the olfactory bulb, amygdala, entorhinal area, temporal and frontal neocortex, and dorsal medulla (Serrano et al., 2021). In this study, the olfactory bulb was the only brain region with viral RNA in more than one subject and had the strongest PCR signal of brain regions studied (Serrano et al., 2021), suggesting that the CNS may be accessed through this route.",
            "In addition to modulating basal homeostatic functions, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is responsible for “fight or flight” reactions. In such situations where the body is under stress, the SNS acts to mitigate this through global release of adrenaline and cortisol (Hanoun et al., 2015). The hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which express the ACE2 receptor, largely mediate the hormonal stress regulatory activity of the SNS via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and may thus represent cardinal central viral targets (Pal, 2020). The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) of the brainstem, which acts as a sensory integrative center for several autonomic functions, projects onto the hypothalamus and also expresses the ACE2 receptor (Porzionato et al., 2020). Additionally, ACE2 is expressed in the carotid body, which can mediate local sympathetic activation to modulate optimal blood oxygenation and blood pressure regulation (Porzionato et al., 2020).",
            "The enteric nervous system (ENS), a branch of the PNS, is located in the walls of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where it plays a key role in gut homeostasis, systemic metabolism and immunity. The parasympathetic NS closely interacts with this branch to control the basal state and digestive functions. Esposito et al. argue that SARS-CoV-2 can directly invade the ENS or the parasympathetic NS, and the virus can spread along the vagus nerve and its innervations of visceral organs, which can potentially provide another route of viral tropism (Esposito et al., 2020; Tassorelli et al., 2020). The parasympathetic pathway can then facilitate entry into the brainstem through vagus nerve synapses onto the NTS in the medulla oblongata (Li et al., 2020c). In rat studies of MERS-CoV, enteric involvement was shown to cause neurological symptoms and to precede respiratory infection (Zhou et al., 2017). Infection via GI inoculation led to higher viral loads in the CNS through feedback regulation via vagal efferents in these studies (Zhou et al., 2017). Moreover, recent work using murine models has identified a novel taxonomy involving twelve enteric neuron classes, distinguished by unique transcription factors, communication features, and functionality (Morarach et al., 2021). The enteric neuron classes develop a distinct diversification pattern through post-mitotic differentiation assisted by spatiotemporal defined landmarks (Morarach et al., 2021). These observations help distinguish the ENS from other branches of the NS and suggest potential new profiles of viral neurotropism embedded within the three-dimensional body axes. The relatively high concentration of ACE2 receptor and viral replication potential within the GI tract, along with frequently noted GI symptoms of COVID-19, emphasize the significance of ENS neurotropism (Esposito et al., 2020). In totality, the PNS will likely prove to be a key and under-appreciated feature of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, inclusive of all three autonomic branches and via direct and indirect target interactions.",
            "The ACE2 receptor is found in neurons, glial cells, astrocytes, endothelial cells, and those of the lung parenchyma alike (Doobay et al., 2007; Miller and Arnold, 2019). This route is likely cell autonomous in nature, with direct target infection via a requisite entry factor (e.g., the ACE2 receptor). While there is no consensus on which cells are directly infected, there is evidence for direct neurotropism of several of these cell types through the presence of contiguous active virions and intracellular viral RNA. For example, a human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived BrainSphere model has been employed to demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of neuronal cells (Bullen et al., 2020). Similarly, Wang et al. have shown that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived ApoE4 neurons and astrocytes are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Wang et al., 2021). Moreover, post-mortem brain tissue analysis of a COVID-19 patient revealed the presence of viral particles in brain endothelial cells, indicating possible direct neurotropism (Bullen et al., 2020; Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020). Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism can exert its actions non-cell autonomously through the use of soluble mediators; extracellular vesicles; inflammatory and immune cell signaling; non-traditional neurotransmitter, neuropeptide and ion channel signaling; via the lymphatics; and by microvascular damage (Hanoun et al., 2015; Solomos and Rall, 2016; Benveniste et al., 2017; Maryanovich et al., 2018; Merad and Martin, 2020; Rhea et al., 2021). Because a relatively low rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected in the brain tissue of patients who died from COVID-19, there is a developing consensus that neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 are due, in large part, to non-cell autonomous effects (Serrano et al., 2021). For example, of twenty COVID-19 patients studied in one neuro-anatomical survey, only two had unequivocal neuropathological findings, and only one of those two had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the brain (Serrano et al., 2021).",
            "Neurotropism can be the result of blood-borne viruses subverting the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Iadecola et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to cross the BBB in a murine model (Rhea et al., 2021). Using the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a proxy for uptake, viral entry was observed throughout the mouse brain parenchyma and in endothelial cells (Rhea et al., 2021). These results implicate direct viral invasion of the BBB in SARS-CoV-2 mediated neurological dysregulation. ACE2 and other viral proteases are expressed on endothelial cells of the vasculature (Xiao et al., 2020). Because lung tissue infected with SARS-CoV-2 shows patterns of damage characteristic of pulmonary fibrosis, viral blood-borne tropism may be facilitated in COVID-19 through upregulated ACE2 in these arterial vascular cells (Guo et al., 2020). Immune cells reaching the CNS may also promote neurotropism, particularly via macrophages and monocytes (Merad and Martin, 2020). Although several autopsy studies have not revealed widespread immune cell infiltration, the potential contributions of infected innate and acquired immune cells to neurotropism may be consequential (Iadecola et al., 2020).",
            "Once in the circulation, the virus may easily avoid the BBB by targeting circumventricular organs in the brain. These CNS sites have areas of fenestrated capillaries where the endothelial border does not represent a fixed boundary to molecular entry (Iadecola et al., 2020). The presence of ACE2 receptors in such delimited CNS locations support this potential route of entry (Chigr et al., 2020). Furthermore, inflammation resulting from reactive oxygen species and free radicals produced by SARS-CoV-2 infection can damage the BBB, facilitating neurotropism via the circulation in other locations lacking fenestrations (Li et al., 2020c). Similarly, cytokines, which are elevated during COVID-19 infection, are known to cross the BBB and contribute to neuroinflammation observed in SARS-CoV-2 brain neuropathological studies (Azizi and Azizi, 2020; Iba et al., 2020; Rhea et al., 2021).",
            "Although the BBB largely segregates the brain from the systemic circulation, toxic wastes and metabolites must still be removed from the brain. A waste removal system, termed “glymphatics” for its dependence on glial cells, is facilitated by a CSF and interstitial fluid transport system (Benveniste et al., 2017). In this system, CSF is transported within a peri-vascular network that helps drain waste from the brain parenchyma (Benveniste et al., 2017). In addition to glymphatics, a true lymphatic vasculature that drains interstitial fluid has been described in the brain’s meningeal layer (Solomos and Rall, 2016). Furthermore, the brain dural sinuses are another location of potential neuro-immune interactions. At the dural sinus, accumulated CNS-derived antigens in the CSF are taken up by dural antigen-presenting cells that introduce the antigens to patrolling T cells (Rustenhoven et al., 2021). Circulating lymphocytes and viral proteins in these systems might be potential routes of both neuroinvasion and subsequent transport back to the periphery (Solomos and Rall, 2016). Other coronaviruses have previously been documented to be present in the CSF (Nath, 2020), and now SARS-CoV-2 has been observed in the CSF of COVID-19 patients with rare neurological presentations like acute necrotizing encephalopathy and demyelination (Domingues et al., 2020; Virhammar et al., 2020).",
            "The ACE2 receptor plays a pivotal role as the initiator of SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry in multiple organs (Xiao et al., 2020). When the viral spike glycoprotein interacts with ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 is endocytosed (Liu et al., 2020a). ACE2 is a key protein for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays a central role in the homeostatic regulation of electrolyte and fluid balance, blood pressure, arterial oxygenation, and end organ function, particularly those mediated by the renal and cardiovascular systems (Li et al., 2017; Miller and Arnold, 2019). The RAS is divided into vasopressor and vasoprotective axes (Li et al., 2017). The multiple arms of this complex pathway ultimately result in the dynamic interplay of two main enzymes: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 1 (ACE1) and ACE2. ACE1 converts angiotensin I (Ang I) to angiotensin II (Ang II), while ACE2 converts Ang I and Ang II to angiotensin (1-7) (Ang (1-7)) and angiotensin (1-9) (Ang (1-9), respectively (Miller and Arnold, 2019). The vasopressor axes are comprised of the classic angiotensinogen/renin/ACE1/Ang II axis and the prorenin/renin axis (Li et al., 2017). The vasoprotective axes, which are dependent on ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Ang (1-9)/Mas receptors, counteract detrimental effects of the vasopressor axes (Li et al., 2017). When SARS-CoV-2 is endocytosed, the ACE2 enzyme is endocytosed with it, shifting the balance of the RAS toward the pro-inflammatory vasopressor axes (Li et al., 2017; Gheblawi et al., 2020). Such disruption of RAS balance, which has previously been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and hypertension, amongst other systemic derangements, may be a driver of COVID-19 systemic dyshomeostasis (Li et al., 2017).",
            "Proteases help to orchestrate neurotropism by assisting the ACE2 receptor interaction with SARS-CoV-2. For epithelial cells, these proteases may even assist viral invasion through non-ACE2-mediated routes, via CD147-spike protein and CD26 expressed ubiquitously (Radzikowska et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a). ACE2 receptors are further modulated by being endocytosed following binding to SARS-COV-2 (Gheblawi et al., 2020; Hirano and Murakami, 2020). Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a serine protease on the plasma membrane that mediates spike protein activation and promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry via direct fusion, thereby subverting endocytic entry (Bailey and Diamond, 2021). ACE2 can exist as a transmembrane bound protein in vascular endothelial cells, or as a circulating form, once cleaved by TMPRSS2 or transmembrane protease serine 4 (TMPRSS4) (Xiao et al., 2020). ACE2 is subsequently shed, giving rise to the circulating form, while TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 simultaneously facilitate the endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 (Xiao et al., 2020).",
            "The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been shown to interact with the soluble form of ACE2 or a soluble ACE2-vasopressin complex extracellularly, and then may enter cells via endocytosis mediated by the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) or arginine-vasopressin receptor 1B (AVPR1B), respectively (Yeung et al., 2021). Additionally, the soluble form of ACE2 preserves the viral binding site and may therefore facilitate viral tropism of cells where the tissue-bound form of ACE2 is poorly expressed (Yeung et al., 2021).",
            "Furin is a pro-protein convertase found in many tissues, including the brain, neuroendocrine organs, the GI tract and liver, with few differences in expression levels (Wu et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains a unique furin cleavage site not found in other β-coronaviruses (Wu et al., 2020). Furin cleavage facilitates stronger viral receptor binding and membrane fusion. These may contribute to the high infectivity profiles and the multi-organ involvement, especially where ACE2 is present at lower levels of expression (Wu et al., 2020). For example, furin produced in intestinal cells could provide an avenue for viral entry into the CNS via the myenteric nerve plexus. Moreover, loss of furin is an effective measure to prevent viral infection (Johnson et al., 2021). Other proteases like cathepsin L, cathepsin B, trypsin, factor X, elastase, and Coronavirus 3CL protease have also been implicated in SARS-CoV2 binding (Gheblawi et al., 2020; Macchiagodena et al., 2020). CRISPR-Cas-9 screening has also identified several genes necessary for the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans, which are negatively charged polymers that likely increase infectivity by attracting exposed positive charges on viruses (Bailey and Diamond, 2021).",
            "Interferon modulation of ACE2 receptors can lead to increased degrees of neurotropism (Merad and Martin, 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020). Interferons are downstream inflammatory products of IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), key inflammatory molecules released by immune cells in multiple tissues affected by COVID-19 (Ziegler et al., 2020). Severe COVID-19 infection and death following infection have been associated with elevated inflammatory markers and chemokines (Merad and Martin, 2020). The resulting interferons enhance viral invasion as Ziegler et al. demonstrated that ACE2 receptors represent the translation product of interferon-stimulated genes in human barrier tissue epithelial cells (Ziegler et al., 2020). Smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with the increased presence of endocytic vacuoles implicated in SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis (Eapen et al., 2021). Patients with this pathogenic profile may be more susceptible to viral entry and associated profiles of neurotropism. With endocytosis and downregulation of surface ACE2 proteins, the pro-inflammatory axes of the RAS can prevail, namely through Ang II and the AT1R (Gheblawi et al., 2020). Interferon-stimulated ACE2 and ACE2 endocytosis both can modulate viral entry. However, a novel truncated isoform of the ACE2, termed deltaACE2 or MIRb-ACE2, has recently been discovered (Ng et al., 2020; Onabajo et al., 2020). This truncated ACE2 isoform has been observed to be induced by interferons and viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (Ng et al., 2020; Onabajo et al., 2020). The novel truncated ACE2 isoform does not appear to bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or act as a peptidase, suggesting that interferon-stimulated induction may not play a role in promoting SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry (Ng et al., 2020; Onabajo et al., 2020).",
            "Several key molecular factors are closely involved in stress-mediated dysregulation, including catecholamines: adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine (DA); peptide hormones and associated factors: arginine vasopressin (AVP), Ang II; and steroid hormones, including cortisol (Goldstein, 2020). This broad-based stress-mediated bioactive factor deregulation leads to activation of the sympathetic nervous system which, in turn, increases Ang II, depletes ACE2 and subsequently decreases the protective action of Ang (1-7) (Xiao et al., 2011; Porzionato et al., 2020). These mechanisms are associated with typically observed laboratory values and manifestations observed in COVID-19 infection: hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, electrocardiogram abnormalities, cytokine storm, heart failure, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), clotting disorders, and emotional stress (Porzionato et al., 2020).",
            "The Ang II peptide of the RAS can act on a few receptor types, the most notable being AT1R to effect change, including increased sympathetic tone (Xia and Lazartigues, 2010; Miller and Arnold, 2019). AT1R is a major mediator of RAS in raising blood pressure through several homeostatic mechanisms (Miller and Arnold, 2019). AT1R is localized at circumventricular organ sites and other cardinal integrative regulatory centers of the brain like the hypothalamus and medulla (Doobay et al., 2007). Circulating Ang II can mediate activation of the SNS by acting on circumventricular organs and the carotid body (Porzionato et al., 2020). This system is triggered during times of blood loss, hyponatremia, renal hypotension, general SNS activation and infection. Notably, an overactive SNS is implicated in many comorbidities associated with mortality in COVID-19 (Porzionato et al., 2020). Ang II interacts with the pro-inflammatory AT1R, and downstream products of these processes activate STAT3 and NF-κB transcription factors (Hirano and Murakami, 2020). This promotes IL-6 production, which upregulates NF-κB and STAT3 with production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines (Hirano and Murakami, 2020).",
            "ACE2 allows Ang (1-7) to act on Mas receptors to countervail AT1R actions (Miller and Arnold, 2019), since the Mas receptor mediates vasodilation and anti-proliferative effects (Xia and Lazartigues, 2010). ACE2 overexpression promotes a protective phenotype in cardiovascular disease states in transgenic mouse models (Alenina and Bader, 2019). ACE2 in the hypothalamus has powerful antihypertensive and sympathetic nervous system dampening effects, with ACE2 overexpression increasing Ang (1–7) relative to Ang II, thereby providing beneficial effects in mouse models displaying brain injury and stroke (Alenina and Bader, 2019). ACE1/ACE 2 receptor interactions work to effectively mediate the effects of Ang II and Ang (1-7). Unfortunately, with SARS-COV-2 infection, AT1R activity frequently prevails.",
            "As mentioned, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with the ACE2 receptor in epithelial cells, which line a variety of tissues including the lung, heart, and kidney. SARS-CoV-2 infection thus potentially contributes to intricate profiles of end organ damage via interacting neural and ACE2-RAS deregulation of cardinal homeostatic processes. The involvement of and damage to the CNS affects different systemic organ systems which then exert feedback regulation to the CNS to exacerbate the neurological and overall clinical patterns of COVID-19 infection (Robinson et al., 2016; Batlle et al., 2020; Garvin et al., 2020; Hundt et al., 2020; Lei et al., 2020). Recent autopsy results of COVID-19 patients reflect dysregulation of key molecular factors involved in hypoxia, coagulation, and fibrosis in multiple organs, highlighting the extent of aberrant local regulatory processes and systemic homeostasis (Nie et al., 2021).",
            "Pulmonary edema as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection may occur as a result of the activation of the bradykinin 1 and 2 receptors (B1R and B2R, respectively) in lung epithelial cells. Normally, ACE2 plays a protective role by preventing fluid accumulation through inactivation of the B1R ligand known as bradykinin (BK). Bradykinin lowers blood pressure and promotes capillary leakage. Furthermore, elevated D-dimer levels in these patients are most likely reflective of the leakage of plasma contents. A similar mechanism leading to pulmonary edema has been suggested to play an important role in ARDS and COVID-19 due to increased hydrostatic pressures as a result of increased Ang II. Increased Ang II has been experimentally shown to not alter hydrostatic pressure; however, increased bradykinin has been proposed to increase hydrostatic pressure. ACE1 inactivates bradykinin, which is an activating ligand of B2R, while ACE2 inactivates nine-arginine bradykinin (Arg9-BK) and bradykinin without nine-arginine (des-Arg9-BK) which are activating ligands of B1R (van de Veerdonk et al., 2020). In bronchoalveolar samples of COVID-19 patients, the BK precursor, kininogen, was expressed while remaining undetected in control specimens. Furthermore, BK degradative enzymes were downregulated compared to those present in control patients (Garvin et al., 2020). There is significant upregulation of the genes encoding the enzymes responsible for production of different forms of hyaluronic acid. The corresponding enzymes responsible for its degradation, hyaluronidases, are conversely downregulated. Hyaluronic acid promotes avid water absorption leading to the formation of a hydrogel within the lungs. The combination of increased vascular permeability due to increased bradykinin levels as well as increased hyaluronic acid production leads to hydrogel formation impairing the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide within the lungs of patients with COVID-19. Interestingly, the alveolar type I cells in the lung may act as homeostatic regulators of alveolar organization and function following injury, since they have been described to remodel the postnatal mice alveolus via distinct intracellular signaling factors (Zepp et al., 2021).",
            "Although the exact mechanisms of liver damage in COVID-19 remain to be elucidated, direct tropism via the ACE2 receptor expressed in hepatocytes, secondary hepatic damage as a result of systemic inflammation, and the hepatotoxicity of COVID-19 therapies contribute to organ dysfunction (Han et al., 2021a). Because the liver plays an important role in regulating inflammation by producing acute phase proteins, complement proteins, and several cytokines, liver damage in COVID-19 could potentially contribute to central homeostatic dysregulation of immune function (Robinson et al., 2016).",
            "The kidney regulates blood pressure and blood volume through the RAS. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequently observed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Batlle et al., 2020; Benedetti et al., 2020; Farouk et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020). As with COVID-19-associated liver injury, the mechanisms of AKI are likely multifactorial. ACE2 is strongly expressed in the kidney, suggesting direct SARS-CoV-2 renal tropism (Batlle et al., 2020; Benedetti et al., 2020; Farouk et al., 2020). However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viral particles in the kidney has not been consistently reported in the literature (Farouk et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020). The non-cell autonomous influences of hyperinflammation, hypoxemia, and hypercoagulability may contribute to the development of AKI (Batlle et al., 2020; Benedetti et al., 2020; Farouk et al., 2020). Moreover, ACE2 expression has been found to be downregulated in AKI (Batlle et al., 2020). This may lead to higher ACE1 expression and lower levels of Ang (1-7), which could promote a hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable state in the kidney (Batlle et al., 2020). Because the causes of COVID-19 AKI are likely multifaceted, the disruption of RAS homeostasis in the kidney may create a vicious cycle that exacerbates renal and systemic damage.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 has been hypothesized to infect the CNS through the cribriform plate, travel in a retrograde fashion through peripheral olfactory nerves to the brain stem (inclusive of the medulla) and to target and destroy the medullary centers responsible for cardiorespiratory control, such as the Pre-Botzinger complex. This has been thought to result in the compromise of the respiratory centers (Gandhi et al., 2020). Similar neurotropic viruses, like the avian coronavirus, have been reported to track to nuclei of the medulla: the NTS and the nucleus ambiguus (NA), sites that receive information from the chemoreceptors of the respiratory tract and lungs and innervate local resident smooth muscle, glands, and vessels (Costa et al., 2014; Li et al., 2020b).",
            "In SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is a proposed loss of homeostatic control by the medulla resulting in cardiorespiratory compromise: inadequate blood flow, respiration and oxygenation, leading to a multifaceted impairment of alveolar gas exchange. In healthy individuals, peripheral chemoreceptors, present at highest concentrations in the carotid body and aortic arch, monitor the flux of arterial oxygen levels. When there is arterial oxygen desaturation, an excitatory signal is sent from the glomeruli here, most directly to the NTS, integrating at the rostral ventrolateral medulla (Costa et al., 2014). In a hypoxic state with low oxygen reserves, the body will aggressively work to increase blood flow to high impact organs, promote vasoconstriction in other peripheral locations, and increase respiratory rate as well as inspiratory/expiratory force, in an attempt to efficiently deploy oxygen (Costa et al., 2014; Tassorelli et al., 2020). There is likely an inability to adequately detect and respond to changes in oxygenation when SARS-CoV-2 infection compromises medullary and carotid body oxygen sensing and set-point regulation as well as sensory nerve-related respiratory muscle function. The often profound hypoxemia, frequently without premonitory symptoms, is characteristic of COVID-19 patients facing imminent respiratory compromise and is indicative of homeostatic deregulation.",
            "Interestingly, increases in peripheral hypoxic chemosensitivity have been ascribed to overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (Porzionato et al., 2020). A hyperactive sympathetic nervous system due to higher hypoxic chemosensitivity has been implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and metabolic syndrome, comorbidities that enhance the severity of COVID-19 (Porzionato et al., 2020).",
            "Acute GI symptoms of COVID-19 include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (Esposito et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020c). Viral neurotropism of the area postrema and in the NTS of the medulla oblongata of the brainstem may disrupt their normal homeostatic roles. The NTS is particularly known to be targeted by other coronaviruses, emphasizing its potential role in the acute GI symptoms frequently seen in COVID-19 (Porzionato et al., 2020).",
            "The ENS regulates gut homeostasis through interactions between enteric glial cells, gut epithelium, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) (Esposito et al., 2020). Enteric glial cells serve as antigen-presenting cells to the GALT, and their activation is characterized by IL-6 release, contributing to inflammation in COVID-19 (Esposito et al., 2020). Furthermore, their activation by viruses has been implicated as a key step in neurological immune priming that leads to later neurological impairments (Esposito et al., 2020). Deregulation of these components of the nervous system may therefore be responsible for the observed GI dysfunction.",
            "Specific forms of neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 may be related, among other pathological processes, to characteristic features of the newly-defined COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC). Disruption of interactions between the coagulation cascade and inflammation has been observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients; CAC is unique in that it presents with elevated fibrinogen, D-dimer levels, Von Willebrand factor (VWF), factor VIII and inflammatory cytokines that can induce a generalized thrombotic disorder (Iba et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 infected macrophages express tissue factor on their cell surface promoting coagulation. Factor VIII and VWF released by SARS-CoV-2 infected endothelial cells also contribute to increased coagulation. Thrombosis may occur due to these multifaceted prothrombotic modifications in cell signaling (Iba et al., 2020). However, unlike other coagulopathies, CAC is not marked by thrombocytopenia and does not show increased partial thromboplastin time, distinguishing it from similar disorders of sepsis-induced coagulopathy (Iba et al., 2020).",
            "CAC is notable for endothelial damage as SARS-CoV-2 directly infects vascular endothelial cells via ACE2 receptors with the help of TMPRSS2 cleavage. Damaged endothelial cells then fail to produce nitric oxide, thus allowing adhesion of leukocytes and platelets and migration of inflammatory cells into the vessel wall (Iba et al., 2020). In the event of infection, endothelial cell damage results in tissue factor release, especially in the brain, activating thrombin, the final serine protease in the coagulation cascade (Festoff and Citron, 2019). Because thrombin exerts pro-inflammatory effects in addition to its role in coagulation, it plays a key role in the interactions mediating the coagulation-inflammatory nexus (Festoff and Citron, 2019). Thrombin cleaves the protease-activated receptor on endothelial cells to gain access through the BBB to the CNS, where it can then lead to neuroinflammation (Festoff and Citron, 2019).",
            "The result of this robust coagulation, inflammation, and endothelial damage, including active viral-mediated endotheliitis, is profound degrees of vasculitis, thrombosis, and stroke affecting large arterial and venous vessels as well as the entire brain and body microvasculature, including arterioles, venules and capillary beds. This results in complex impairments in oxygen exchange and unique microinfarctions and mechanosensitive microbleeds with dramatic CNS microglial activation, active innate immune sensing and neuroinflammation (Azizi and Azizi, 2020; Iba et al., 2020; Thakur et al., 2021). Microscopic examination of the brains of patients who have died from COVID-19 has indicated multifocal microvascular ischemic and hemorrhagic parenchymal injury, neuroinflammation and microglial activation without cell autonomous viral effects targeting neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes (Lee et al., 2020; Thakur et al., 2021).",
            "An unusual inflammatory syndrome characterized by fever, inflammation, and multisystem organ injury has been associated with a subset of COVID-19 patients, including children (Whittaker et al., 2020). Elevated fractions of mononuclear phagocytes, particularly inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages, have also been observed in COVID-19 patients (Liao et al., 2020; Merad and Martin, 2020). Overactivation of these mononuclear phagocytes may contribute to the cytokine storm that is characteristic of COVID-19, and the cytokine profile of COVID-19 hyperinflammation resembles that of macrophage activation syndrome (Merad and Martin, 2020). Elevated cytokines, namely IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), released by macrophages in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, not only promote an inflammatory milieu, but may also stimulate upregulation of the ACE2 receptor, further driving SARS-CoV-2 regional cellular tropism (Merad and Martin, 2020).",
            "Hyperinflammation and activation of mononuclear phagocytes may also contribute to the process of hypercoagulation observed in COVID-19. In the absence of direct vascular damage, the initiation of coagulation is dependent on increased expression of the pro-thrombotic molecule, coagulation factor III, on mononuclear cells via pro-inflammatory cytokines (Merad and Martin, 2020). An inflammatory state inhibits anticoagulant pathways, further promoting a severe systemic hypercoagulable state. For example, antiphospholipid antibodies, which are characteristically present in several autoimmune conditions, activate the complement and coagulation cascades to contribute to thrombosis and to mediate proinflammatory signaling in innate immune and vascular endothelial cells (Muller-Calleja et al., 2021). Müller-Calleja et al. recently described a process by which endothelial protein C receptors act in complex with the lipid lysobisphosphatidic acid to activate pathogenic antiphospholipid antibodies, representing a mechanistic link between coagulation and innate immune signaling (Muller-Calleja et al., 2021).",
            "The autonomic nervous system plays a crucial homeostatic role through its pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects on immune cells. An innate immune response activates sensory neurons that release neuropeptides such as calcitonin-gene-related peptide and substance P, the downstream products of which promote inflammation (Hanoun et al., 2015). When the HPA axis detects inflammation via afferent nerves or inflammatory markers, it exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by stimulating glucocorticoids and dopamine release from the adrenal glands (Hanoun et al., 2015; Maryanovich et al., 2018).",
            "Both major branches of the autonomic nervous system contribute to neural regulation of the immune response. The SNS releases noradrenaline that exerts distinct actions through specific subtypes of adrenergic receptors. Noradrenaline has pro-inflammatory effects at low concentrations and anti-inflammatory effects at high concentrations (Hanoun et al., 2015). Chronic inflammation alters the expression pattern of adrenergic receptor subtypes and shifts local innervation toward pro-inflammatory sensory nerves (Hanoun et al., 2015); it is possible that COVID-19 causes this type of shift as well (Porzionato et al., 2020). Furthermore, in murine models, increased sympathetic stimulation led to noradrenaline-mediated vascular inflammation and increased output of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes (Porzionato et al., 2020). While there is no definitive evidence for direct parasympathetic innervation of the immune system, inflammatory cytokines activate afferent branches of the parasympathetic NS to send signals to the NTS and activate efferent branches of the parasympathetic NS (Hanoun et al., 2015; Maryanovich et al., 2018). The parasympathetic NS can then counteract an inflammatory state via acetylcholine release (Hanoun et al., 2015). For example, activation of the parasympathetic NS has been shown to mediate an anti-inflammatory immune cell response via inhibition of tumor necrosis factor release by macrophages (Porzionato et al., 2020).",
            "The circadian control of the immune system represents an additional axis that may be disrupted by COVID-19. The “master clock” of the circadian system is the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (Scheiermann et al., 2013). The HPA axis and SNS modulate local circadian rhythms in body tissues through hormonal and autonomic neural regulation of peripheral clock components (Scheiermann et al., 2013). The SNS can act as a local regulator of the body clocks because the SNS directly innervates tissues and drives cyclical noradrenaline release from nerve varicosities (Scheiermann et al., 2013). A large complement of circulating hematopoietic cells, lymphocytes, hormones, and cytokines have been shown to exhibit circadian oscillations (Scheiermann et al., 2013). In murine models, the acute inflammatory response exhibits circadian rhythms, likely due to circadian-influenced leukocyte migration and phagocytic activity (Scheiermann et al., 2013). Furthermore, several diseases in humans display circadian dysregulation as part of their presentation. Myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, documented consequences of COVID-19, are examples of such diseases, where a surge in SNS activity during the morning hours is thought to contribute to cardiovascular complications (Scheiermann et al., 2013; Choudry et al., 2020). It is conceivable that SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, both in the central and peripheral nervous systems, could therefore be adversely impacting the modulation of the circadian system over the immune system, thereby contributing to some of the observed COVID-19-related acute phase complications.",
            "Furthermore, the peripheral nervous system also dynamically regulates bone remodeling and bone marrow effector functions. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow are activated in response to infection to maintain homeostasis (Maryanovich et al., 2018). The SNS has been documented to regulate the microenvironment in the bone marrow, where sympathetic nerve fibers help to create niches essential for normal HSC egress and differentiation of individual blood elements as well as behavioral effects during stress (Maryanovich et al., 2018). Sensory nerves also reach the bone marrow, and sensory neuropeptides have been suggested to directly contribute to regulating HSC activity (Maryanovich et al., 2018). Many of the unique systemic manifestations of COVID-19 affect the derivatives of HSCs like platelets, red blood cells, and immune cells, potentially suggesting that HSCs represent another end organ effector system at the cellular level whose components are differentially regulated and impaired by SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Bidirectional neuro-immune communications involving the lymph nodes represent another axis where the function of sensory neurons may be disrupted. Recent work by Huang et al. further elucidates previously described communications between the PNS and the immune system (Huang et al., 2021). They find that lymph nodes are innervated by heterogeneous populations of sensory and sympathetic neurons which demonstrate inflammation-induced plasticity (Huang et al., 2021). These sensory neurons are largely skewed toward peripheral lymph nodes, suggesting that these neurons can act to monitor the homeostatic status of the lymphatic system (Huang et al., 2021). When activated, these neurons can modulate activity-dependent gene transcription in immune cells (Huang et al., 2021). SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism could be differentially targeting sensory neurons in this heterogeneous population, thereby contributing to the maladaptive immune response. Dysregulation of the interactions of the PNS with the immune system may therefore be contributing to the hyperinflammatory state of COVID-19 and its concomitant and protean systemic manifestations.",
            "There is increasing evidence of a “Long COVID” syndrome, in which some COVID-19 patients, regardless of initial disease severity, experience manifestations of the illness beyond acute COVID-19 infection (Al-Aly et al., 2021; Boldrini et al., 2021). A profile of patients with “Long COVID” reveals fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction as the most common symptoms of this syndrome reported up to 6 months from the acute period of illness (Davis et al., 2020). Many of these patients experience prolonged multisystem involvement and significant disability (Davis et al., 2020). This is analogous to a prolonged post-concussive syndrome associated with elements of traumatic brain injury. Such a clinical course is compatible with the lack of regenerative responses described in COVID-19 (Delorey et al., 2021).",
            "Given the unprecedented range and severity of acute neurological COVID-19 syndromes already described in the literature, the consequences of prolonged aberrant, viral-mediated neural regulation of systemic processes are likely to be profound. Many of the observed long-term sequelae are likely due to a disruption of the bi-directional interactions of the nervous system and the immune system detailed above, which promotes a pro-inflammatory, hypoxemic, hypercoagulable state. This sustained detrimental environment is known to promote long-term neurological syndromes including demyelinating disorders, degenerative dementias, movement disorders, delayed immune-mediated encephalopathies, neuromuscular disorders, neuropsychiatric conditions and unusual cognitive disorders frequently seen with prior delayed effects of head and spinal cord injuries, rare focal neurovascular syndromes, and more remote effects of viral encephalitides (Tavassoly et al., 2020). These post-acute sequelae may be associated with alterations in cortical circuit hyperconnectivity, impaired excitation-inhibition coupling, excitotoxicity, and immune memory dysfunction (Brun et al., 2020; Domingues et al., 2020; Zanin et al., 2020).",
            "The resulting pathological substrate, including COVID-19 coagulopathy, vasculopathy, neuroinflammation, and immune dysregulation, increases the risk of COVID-19 related strokes, including atypical presentations indicative of multiple large vessel involvement or diffuse microvascular ischemia and hemorrhage, the latter frequently presenting as a persistent encephalopathy without additional lateralizing neurological signs representing the potential progression of a classical delirium into a syndrome of mild to moderate protracted cognitive disability (Hess et al., 2020). Additionally, demyelinating lesions of the CNS have been described as a sequela as a result of inflammation-induced glial cell activation (Brun et al., 2020; Zanin et al., 2020). Similarly, neuronophagia and microglial nodules have been found in the cerebellar dentate nuclei of a COVID-19 patient (Al-Dalahmah et al., 2020). These may be the result of microglial cell activation by cytokines, which drives phagocytosis of hypoxic neurons (Al-Dalahmah et al., 2020). ApoE4, a genetic risk factor for neural injury responses in Alzheimer’s disease and other degenerative dementias and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, has been shown in glial cells to exacerbate neurodegeneration and is associated with more severe COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2021). SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to preferentially target and induce death of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived ApoE4 astrocytes (Wang et al., 2021). These results may help explain why a subset of COVID-19 patients have neurodegenerative manifestations and accelerated aging phenotypes (Wang et al., 2021).",
            "The inability to return to normal homeostasis after acute infection may result in an unprecedented level of stress and injury, which has profound implications for the long-term sequelae of COVID-19. In this section, we explore how this unique pathology may lead to organ fibrosis, tissue degeneration, and systemic cancer.",
            "Multiple cellular responses must be coordinated to restore homeostasis (You et al., 2021). Severe stress conditions adversely impact the differentiation and tissue regenerative functions of HSCs (Cho et al., 2013). In human stress and disease environments, transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms disrupt tissue-specific stem and progenitor cell homeostasis (Puisieux et al., 2018). For example, dysregulation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein stress response impairs HSC proliferation, and additional degrees of extreme stress via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response induces HSC apoptosis and associated regenerative responses (Puisieux et al., 2018). Moreover, sympathetic hyperactivation, a feature of COVID-19, has been observed to deregulate HSC niches (Maryanovich et al., 2018).",
            "Stress and injury also have influences at the level of inter-organelle communications, where, for example, stress to the ER has been identified as a hallmark of hyperinflammation, protein misfolding, and cell death (You et al., 2021). The unfolded protein response is central to the resolution of ER stress programs because it modulates newly-described transcriptional regulators like QRICH1 that dictates cell fate responses (You et al., 2021). In situations of unresolved, sustained stress, a dysregulated unfolded protein response can ultimately induce cell dysfunction and death (You et al., 2021). In C. elegans models, dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons have been found to be necessary and sufficient for activating the non-cell autonomous ER-mediated unfolded protein response in peripheral tissues to promote lipid homeostasis, including lipophagy, and proteostasis that extend lifespan (Daniele et al., 2020; Higuchi-Sanabria et al., 2020). These results emphasize the dynamic interplay between the nervous system and peripheral homeostatic mechanisms in responding to stress to regulate the continuum between premature aging phenotypes and longevity responses. Nuclear histones are another cellular component whose role in suppressing immunogenicity has been highlighted (Uggenti et al., 2020). Stress and injury may interfere with the ability of specific components of the immune system to distinguish between self- and non-self-nucleic acids, as emphasized by autoinflammatory disorders associated with deregulated type I interferon responses (Uggenti et al., 2020). Chromatin without linker histones stimulates the DNA sensor, cGAMP, activating the interferon response which ultimately leads to self-DNA-induced immunogenicity and inflammation (Uggenti et al., 2020).",
            "Epithelial cells in multiple organs participate in tissue regenerative capabilities that may be compromised in COVID-19 (Delorey et al., 2021). In the liver, both hepatocytes and biliary tract cells demonstrate regenerative plasticity, suggesting that these cells can act as facultative stem cells to replenish liver parenchymal cells following injury. A unique population of airway basal stem cells that can sense hypoxia has recently been identified (Shivaraju et al., 2021). Hypoxic conditions cause these stem cells to differentiate into solitary neuroendocrine cells, which can then mitigate the effects of hypoxic injury (Shivaraju et al., 2021). Solitary neuroendocrine cells secrete calcitonin gene-related peptide which acts as a paracrine signal to repair epithelial cell damage (Shivaraju et al., 2021). Damage to this protective cell type may lead to long-term airway epithelial cell damage. Epithelial cells in the lung in particular are important in recovery from pulmonary fibrosis (Basil et al., 2020). Alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells can act as a self-renewing stem cell-like population and regenerate alveolar epithelial type 1 cells, which constitute the majority of the alveolar surface (Basil et al., 2020). In pulmonary fibrosis, it has been hypothesized that stress and injury disrupt AT2 cell homeostasis and causes them to lose their regenerative capacity (Basil et al., 2020). If such a mechanism occurs with lung fibrosis observed in COVID-19, then the ability of the lungs to recover may be chronically compromised.",
            "Potential damage to endothelial cells in the lymphatic system may play a role in the recovery from COVID-19 vasculopathy. Lymphatic endothelial cells have recently been found to secrete a lymphoangiocrine signal, the extracellular protein reelin (RELN) (Liu et al., 2020b). RELN mediates the proliferation of cardiomyocytes during mouse heart development and improves cardiac regeneration in neonatal mice (Liu et al., 2020b). In murine models, RELN has been shown to be essential for efficient heart repair and function following myocardial infarction (Liu et al., 2020b). RELN mediates the proliferation of cardiomyocytes. While it is unknown whether COVID-19 targets lymphatic endothelial cells, damage to this axis may present with disruption of putative tissue regeneration in the context of ongoing and possibly latent viral-mediated injury responses. Additionally, disruption of the glymphatic system has recently been suggested as a contributory factor to the progression of neurodegeneration that is likely operative in COVID-19 (Nedergaard and Goldman, 2020). The glymphatic system serves to clear protein aggregates during sleep; since age is associated with increased protein aggregation, decreased sleep quality, and risk for neurodegenerative disease (Nedergaard and Goldman, 2020); disruption of the glymphatic system may be a link between these deregulated homeostatic processes in COVID-19.",
            "Organ fibrosis is a deregulated tissue regenerative response that can occur as a result of sustained or severe injury or chronic inflammation that is seen in COVID-19 (Henderson et al., 2020). During normal tissue repair following injury, local tissue fibroblasts are activated to synthesize components of the extracellular matrix and to secrete inflammatory mediators (Henderson et al., 2020). Deregulation of this cardinal homeostatic process, which may occur as a plausible consequence of COVID-19, can result in the excessive deposition and accumulation of a disorganized extracellular matrix within end organs (Henderson et al., 2020). These fibrotic changes fundamentally alter tissue structure, disrupt organ function, and can lead to organ and subsequent organismal dysfunction and death (Henderson et al., 2020). A persistent low level of stress due to COVID-19 may lead to a unique form of pan-organ fibrosis in which the organs do not actually undergo acute injury or death, but rather experience chronic dysfunction and novel forms of delayed brain and body malfunction (Henderson et al., 2020). There is increasing evidence that if the underlying cause of injury is removed, human organ fibrosis can resolve via the elimination of fibroblasts and the degradation of the extracellular matrix (Jun and Lau, 2018). In this way, the affected tissue does not progress to organ failure, but rather retains a degree of dysfunction and plasticity that would normally be observed in the initial or plateau phase of fibrosis. Moreover, recent analysis of single-cell atlases of multiple COVID-19 affected tissues has uncovered several failed tissue regenerative pathways in response to SARS-CoV-2, including the proliferation of fibroblasts and impaired AT2 differentiation (Delorey et al., 2021). This analysis also linked related cell types and genes implicated in disease severity to heritable risk using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (Delorey et al., 2021), further underscoring how COVID-19 may act as an accelerated aging phenotype.",
            "Stress and injury can also increase the susceptibility of cells to undergo malignant transformation (Puisieux et al., 2018). Environmental contexts such as pro-inflammatory signals have been suggested to affect cellular differentiation processes that protect against tumorigenesis (Puisieux et al., 2018). In inappropriate contexts like severe stress, differentiated adult epithelial cells undergo reprogramming, which may lead to the generation of cell states prone to malignancy (Puisieux et al., 2018). Central to this mechanism is the inactivation of p53, the loss of which promotes evasion of cell-cycle checkpoints and apoptosis (Puisieux et al., 2018). These processes also lead to enduring lineage infidelities and the commissioning of tumor related super-enhancers (Ge et al., 2017). Furthermore, Li et al. show that pancreatic inflammation is linked to a transient metaplastic progenitor cell population harboring a proto-oncogene mediated enhancer network that is co-opted by mutant Kras to subsequently drive tumorigenesis, suggesting that inflammation can also promote oncogenesis by gene enhancer network remodeling (Li et al., 2021). Moreover, innate immune priming and associated immune modulatory states can occur as a result of deregulation of specific immune molecular effector stress response pathways and result in a spectrum of context-specific outcomes including multiple forms of programmed cell death such as apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, inflammatory states, autoimmunity as well as immune deficiency with profound implications for intermediate and more long-term COVID-19 sequelae (Li et al., 2019; Lalaoui et al., 2020; Malireddi et al., 2020). Additionally, tumor cells can promote a hypercoagulable state by producing and secreting prothrombotic factors and inflammatory cytokines (Caine et al., 2002). Malignant transformation may therefore exacerbate CAC and lead to long-term coagulopathy. Taken together, the multiple modes and degrees of disruption in COVID-19 will likely subvert the body’s ability to maintain or reestablish homeostasis.",
            "Repurposing drugs that can act on the autonomic and central nervous systems, including those targeting neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptors and ligands that modulate immune cell subsets involved in COVID-19 immune dysregulation, may be an important direction for therapy. This would provide a route of symptom management and for halting disease progression through the application of already tested, manufactured, and inexpensive drugs. For example, hyperactivation of the SNS can be addressed using therapeutic agents for the adrenergic system. Further highlighting the opportunities for drug repurposing, imatinib, mycophenolic acid, and quinacrine dihydrochloride, which are already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into relevant lung and intestinal cell types derived from human pluripotent stem cell-derived model systems (Han et al., 2021b). Moreover, recent analysis of the structural elements of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has identified specific host cellular proteins that bind to viral RNA and therefore may be targeted employing antisense oligonucleotides and existing FDA-approved drugs to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection (Sun et al., 2021).",
            "Addressing the long-term systemic sequelae will likely require sophisticated combination therapies. Depending on the temporal characteristics of a patient’s COVID-19 disease progression, immune agents that dampen or activate the immune system may be used, including advanced forms of checkpoint therapy for better optimization of cancer immunotherapy. Recently, N6-methyladenosine, an epigenetic modification of RNA involved in immune responses and tumorigenesis, has been found to activate the adenosine A3 receptor (Ogawa et al., 2021). The adenosine A3 receptor is a regulator of seminal tissue functions found to be overexpressed in inflammatory and cancer cells (Borea et al., 2015). This suggests that RNA modifications could be leveraged as a potential therapy for COVID-19 sequelae. Because COVID-19 potentially deregulates HSC niches, drugs affecting blood components may be potentially repurposed. For example, erythropoietin could be used to stimulate red blood cells and to mitigate hypoxemia (Soliz et al., 2020). The inflammatory environment created by neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been implicated in tumorigenesis (Xiao et al., 2021). Xiao et al. have shown that targeting the tumor-secreted protease cathepsin C inhibits metastasis by limiting neutrophil recruitment and NET formation (Xiao et al., 2021), suggesting neutrophils are another blood component that can be regulated to mitigate the development of malignancy as a long-term sequela. Moreover, because remodeling of bone marrow niches can facilitate immune evasion and survival of malignant hematopoietic cells (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2020), the microenvironment of these niches can also be targeted (Ho et al., 2019). Additionally, retrograde signals, including neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, hormones, and non-coding RNAs, by which the nervous system separately modulates lipid homeostasis, proteostasis and mitochondrial integrity in peripheral tissues through multiple mechanisms, including the integrated stress response and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (Daniele et al., 2020; Higuchi-Sanabria et al., 2020), may therefore be repurposed to prevent premature aging phenotypes. This may also promote homeostatic responses underlying longevity to protect against a plethora of age-associated diseases likely to be seen as sequelae of COVID-19.",
            "There are many unaddressed questions that will impact the direction and manifestations of long-term COVID-19 sequelae. These include: How do the selective pressures driving SARS-CoV-2 mutational variants impact the interactions between the nervous system and systemic organs, tissues, and cell types? Does the spectrum of atypical systemic presentations and the prevalence of acute neuropsychiatric manifestations indicate the occurrence of rapid evolutionary forces influencing viral-mediated systemic and nervous system associated cross-regulation and dyshomeostasis? Are the long-term sequelae a consequence of ongoing effects of the acute disease state and/or distinct effects of injury responses, immunological memory, or latent reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2? Will the selective pressures that give rise to viral variants affect the long-term course of the COVID-19 disease process? Are SARS-CoV-2 variants inherently circumscribed by the evolutionary biology or rather are they infinitely adaptable?",

            "The world faces an exceptional new public health concern caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), subsequently termed the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Although the clinical symptoms mostly have been characterized, the scientific community still doesn´t know how SARS-CoV-2 successfully reaches and spreads throughout the central nervous system (CNS) inducing brain damage. The recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in frontal lobe sections from postmortem examination has confirmed the presence of the virus in neural tissue. This finding reveals a new direction in the search for a neurotherapeutic strategy in the COVID-19 patients with underlying diseases. Here, we discuss the COVID-19 outbreak in a neuroinvasiveness context and suggest the therapeutic use of high doses of melatonin, which may favorably modulate the immune response and neuroinflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, clinical trials elucidating the efficacy of melatonin in the prevention and clinical management in the COVID-19 patients should be actively encouraged.",
            "In late December 2019, a number of 27 people with clinical symptoms of dry cough, dyspnea, fever, and bilateral lung infiltrates on imaging with an unknown cause were diagnosed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. A few days later, a new virus of great global public health concern was isolated and designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), later referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Chen et al. 2020a). This new virus was found to be highly contagious and quickly spread globally, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to officially declare the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (Mahase 2020). As an emerging acute respiratory infectious disease, clinical symptoms are characterized predominantly by fever and dry cough followed by dyspnea, bilateral infiltrates, sputum production, haemoptysis, lymphopenia, shortness of breath, sore throat, and neurological and gastrointestinal manifestations (Huang et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020a, b). COVID-19 employs cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for host cell entry (Xu et al. 2020a, b; Zhou et al. 2020a, b), which is present in the type II alveolar cells (Zou et al. 2020), enterocytes from ileum and colon (Xiao et al. 2020), liver cholangiocytes (Qi et al. 2020), aqueous humor (Holappa et al. 2015), myocardial cells (Donoghue et al. 2000), proximal tubule kidney cells (Zou et al. 2020), urothelial bladder cells (Zou et al. 2020), epithelial cells of the oral mucosa (Xu et al. 2020a, b), as well as neurons and glia in the brain stem and particular cerebral regions (Xia and Lazartigues 2010). The high expression and wide distribution of ACE2 receptor in human body may sustain the ubiquitous potential infection of COVID-19 and explain its tropism. It is also recognized that COVID-19 could be transmitted via multiple routes, predominantly binding to ACE2 alveolar epithelial cells (Wan et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020a, b) or by oral-fecal transmission (Gu et al. 2020), among others. To date, it is accepted that the incubation period of COVID-19 is up to 14 days, although it has been suggested that it may be extended up to 24 days, which possibly reflects a double exposure. Furthermore, asymptomatic infection has been additionally reported (Huang et al. 2020; Linton et al. 2020). Interestingly, previous studies showed that the coronavirus also infects the central nervous system (CNS) (Arbour et al. 2000; Lau et al. 2004) since it can spread from the respiratory tract to the CNS, showing neuroinvasive capacities.",
            "There is uncertainty about extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19, including those affecting the CNS. Numerous efforts to implement effective therapeutic strategies are underway. The distressing scenario that the world is experiencing regarding COVID-19 calls for new treatment approaches and, in this respect, we want to emphasize the advantages of melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) as a potential therapeutic agent to ameliorate the CNS damage associated with SARS-CoV-2′s disease. Melatonin is not a molecule addressed to diminish the viral load nor target specific enzymes involved in viral replication and transcription, nevertheless it has multiple indirect antiviral actions (Anderson et al. 2015; Elmahallawy et al. 2015; Junaid et al. 2020; Montiel et al. 2015; Tan et al. 2014). In this regard, some recent reviews have suggested the utility of melatonin as adjunctive or even regular therapy for COVID-19 patients who suffer pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Tan and Hardeland 2020; Zhang et al. 2020), as well as extra-respiratory complications (Dominguez-Rodriguez et al. 2020; Shneider et al. 2020). Regarding the experimental clinical use of melatonin in the current critical situation, it is important to highlight that melatonin is not only a well-known anti-inflammatory (Carrascal et al. 2018), antioxidative (Rodriguez et al. 2004), and immune-enhancing agent (Carrillo-Vico et al. 2005) but also a molecule with a high safety profile (Seabra et al. 2000). Its small size and amphiphilic nature allow melatonin high cell diffusion capability and it has high permeability through biological compartments, including blood brain barrier (BBB) (Tarocco et al. 2019), reaching cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear compartments (Menendez-Pelaez and Reiter 1993; Reiter et al. 2020b). BBB integrity is crucial for the maintenance of CNS, and thus, several neurological disorders debut after deterioration of the BBB (Rosenberg 2012). Melatonin restores BBB homeostasis limiting microvascular hyperpermeability (Alluri et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2017) and therefore making it a promising candidate against neuroinvasion caused by COVID-19. In view of all the above information, this review focuses on characteristics, mechanisms, and implications of CNS involvement caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, in which we speculate on how the use of the melatonin could become the basis for a possible neurotherapeutic approach.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 shares its clinical symptoms with those described for SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) betacoronaviruses. Previously, it has been reported the presence of SARS‐CoV and MERS-CoV particles in the brain of experimental animal models and patients (Ding et al. 2004; Li et al. 2016; Xu et al. 2005). However, regarding SARS‐CoV‐2, two important questions that arise are as follows: (i) The exact route by which the virus enters the CNS and (ii) whether its presence may be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or postmortem tissue specimens collected from COVID-19 victims. It is known that human coronaviruses can penetrate the CNS through different routes, directly from the external environment affecting the olfactory nerve and olfactory bulb neuroepithelium or using either the lymphatic or the hematogenous route, which represents an excellent opportunity to infect endothelial cells of the BBB (Desforges et al. 2014). It has been recently reported that human ACE2 receptors are the gateway for SARS-CoV-2 and that transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the SARS-CoV-2´s spike (S) protein activation, which facilitates viral attachment to the surface of target cells (Hoffmann et al. 2020). Consequently, it can be thought that those brain regions with the highest expression of ACE2 receptors could turn out to be more affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the involvement of other receptors or co-receptors is not definitely discarded. In this context, a recent study using mRNA expression levels data provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas has demonstrated ACE2 in brain regions, such as the olfactory bulb (OB) (Lapina et al. 2020). This may explain the neuropathogenic impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the partial loss of the sense of smell or total anosmia, as a result of nasal inflammation, mucosal edema, and obstruction of airflow into the olfactory cleft. Additionally, the analyses of three databases have shown high expression levels of human ACE2 in several regions of the brain (e.g., substantia nigra) and both neurons and astrocytes, which would help us to understand how SARS-CoV-2 can spread into the brain and cause neurological damage (Chen et al. 2020b) (Fig. 1). Conversely, OB imaging by magnetic resonance was found normal in a COVID-19 patient with anosmia and without intensity signals of nasal congestion in the early phase of the disease (Galougahi et al. 2020); even though, anosmia may persist for a long time. Another essential point for initial viral neuroinvasion is the recent announcement by genome sequencing of the first reported case of SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF (Xiang 2020). Additionally, a recent case study reporting viral particles in endothelial cells and frontal lobe sections obtained at forensic examination confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in neural tissue (Paniz-Mondolfi et al. 2020). After these observations, brain infection is being seriously considered by the scientific community because important pathologies at neurological level are emerging associated with COVID-19 patients; encephalopathy (Filatov et al. 2020; Poyiadji et al. 2020), meningitis/encephalitis (Moriguchi et al. 2020; Ye et al. 2020), Guillain-Barré syndrome (Zhao et al. 2020), cerebrovascular disease (Helms et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020; Zhai et al. 2020) and epilepsy (Karimi et al. 2020). Moreover, Li and colleagues (Li et al. 2020) have hypothesized that the ability of SARS-CoV-2 targeting the CNS may, at least in part, explain the acute respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients. Conversely, it has also been argued that the brain dysfunction induced by SARS-CoV-2 still lacks strong evidence and, therefore, this relevant question should be further investigated.Fig. 1The nasal cavity could be the gateway of SARS-CoV-2 to reach directly the central nervous system through affecting the olfactory nerve and olfactory bulb neuroepithelium. Once in the brain, SARS-CoV-2 would initiate the innate immune responses at early stages of the COVID-19 resulting in neurological disorders. At this point, high doses of melatonin may exert anti-inflammatory effects and act as a buffer against enhanced immunoreactivity, which would reduce the neuropathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection",
            "The nasal cavity could be the gateway of SARS-CoV-2 to reach directly the central nervous system through affecting the olfactory nerve and olfactory bulb neuroepithelium.

At this point, high doses of melatonin may exert anti-inflammatory effects and act as a buffer against enhanced immunoreactivity, which would reduce the neuropathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection",
            "Taken together, the abovementioned evidence indicates that counteracting or mitigating the neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 emerges as an essential strategy to prevent or treat COVID-19. At this point is where melatonin can act as a protective agent against virus-related diseases (Anderson and Reiter 2020; Elmahallawy et al. 2015; Silvestri and Rossi 2013; Tan et al. 2014) and several pathologies of CNS (Brigo et al. 2016; Farez et al. 2015; Gerber et al. 2005; Ramos et al. 2017) including those affecting BBB (Ramos et al. 2017) (Fig. 1). Regardless, it is possible that melatonin may act inside the neural cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Its amphiphilic nature helps it to reach intracellular organelles, binding to mitochondrial and cell cytosol proteins, thus increasing its neural availability (Tan 2010) and therapeutic versatility in at least three different ways. Firstly, melatonin binds to calmodulin (CaM) and may act on the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Ca2+/CaMKII) system, thereby regulating the expression of ACE2 (Lambert et al. 2008). Secondly, CaMKII has been found to copurify with proteasomes of the brain (Bingol et al. 2010) and the ubiquitin–proteasome system is involved in the early viral replicative cycle. Interestingly, like a proteasome inhibitor (Vriend and Reiter 2014), melatonin may regulate several events involved in proteostasis, through the Ca2+/CaMKII system, which can also influence SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Thirdly, given its tectonic impact in host cell homeostasis, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates mitochondrial metabolism. In this regard, it is worth noting that many of the actions displayed by melatonin are directed to maintain mitochondrial function (Tan and Reiter 2019). Particularly with respect to neuronal damage, the neuroprotection provided by melatonin has been revealed to be mediated by the high-affinity melatonin receptors hosted in the mitochondria (Tan and Reiter 2019). Therefore, any decrease of melatonin (pineal or mitochondrial) levels may open a way for increasing the viral control of cellular metabolism and thus speeding up the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and severity of many viral infections (Anderson and Reiter 2020).",
            "About 10–15% of the COVID-19 patients with ARDS and organ failure have been associated with the commonly known as hyperinflammation or “cytokine storm syndrome”. The question that arises is; might SARS-CoV-2 infection trigger a cytokine storm in the brain? In light of recent COVID-19-associated case reports describing a rare form of severe brain damage with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) (Radmanesh et al. 2020), and a patient with an acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy (Poyiadji et al. 2020), it should be considered that COVID-19 infection may induce a “cytokine storm syndrome” in the brain (Mehta et al. 2020), deserving special consideration and further research. In agreement with the above, it has also been reported that upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators and a deregulated immune response can be useful predictors of lethality by COVID-19 (Ruan et al. 2020). Therefore, a plethora of alterations at interconnected signaling pathways, such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Zhou et al. 2020a, b), sirtuins (SIRTs) (Anderson and Reiter 2020), NLRP3 inflammasome (Deftereos et al. 2020), Toll Like Receptors (TLRs) (Conti et al. 2020) or single-pass type I transmembrane receptor (Notch) (Rizzo et al. 2020) are key factors that may modulate COVID-19-related cellular and molecular events (Fig. 2). In this context, as an universal regulator targeting a large number of different signaling pathways and physiological processes, melatonin may exerts a significant neuroimmunomodulatory protection against viral infections (Liu et al. 2019; Ma et al. 2018; Shukla et al. 2019; Tiong et al. 2019; Xu et al. 2018). Consequently, the capacity of the indoleamine for counteracting the neuroinvasion by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection cannot be underestimated, nor neglected and unquestionably it requires further research.Fig. 2Hypothetical diagram of the possible targets where melatonin may act against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS. SARS-CoV-2 enters neuronal cells through ACE2, as the receptor binding domain, and TMPRSS2 for spike protein (s protein) priming. Next, SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid triggers clathrin-mediated endocytosis enhancing cytoplasm release. Subsequently, the single negative strand RNA [( −)gRNA] synthesized from ( +)gRNA template is used to replicate more copies of viral RNAs. Afterwards, subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) synthesized from the ( +)gRNA template encode viral structural and accessory proteins, which are subsequently assembled with newly synthesized viral RNAs in the ER and Golgi, followed by budding into the lumen of the ERGIC to form new virions. Then, virus particles are transported in secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane and released by exocytosis. Furthermore, the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into neuronal cells may dysregulate mitochondrial metabolism increasing ROS and leading to the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. In this regard, melatonin's high diffusibility allows it to enter in neuronal cells, it binds to CaM and may act on the Ca2+/CaMKII system, regulating the expression of ACE2, modulating the linking between endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammatory response and scavenging ROS. However, in both MT1/MT2 and α7nAChR receptors, melatonin-mediated signaling may influence in reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry. When SARS-CoV-2 infects the CNS, it triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. (i) TNF-α, which acts by binding to TNFR receptor recruiting TRADD. This protein binds to TRAF2 to phosphorylate and activate the IKK. Then, IKK complex phosphorylates IKBα, resulting in the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, where it targets many coding genes for mediators of inflammatory responses. (ii) IL-6 induces gene activation in response to cytokine receptor stimulation. STAT3 proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus. JAK2/STAT3 signaling is a crucial link acting as a pivotal mediator of neuroinflammation. (iii) The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the TLR (TLR3/7/9) upregulates the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB and causes the release of pro-IL-1β which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Consequently, melatonin may revert these pro-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and NF-κB translocation. In addition, as an anti-inflammatory agent, melatonin inhibits the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Stimulation (blue colored) or inhibition (red colored) by melatonin and SARS-CoV-2 are also shown.

            "Given the astonishing pleiotropy of melatonin, it may be expected that cellular and molecular mechanisms by which this indoleamine mediates neuroprotection would be complex as well. To a some extent the biological effects of melatonin are mediated through the interaction with two high-affinity G protein-coupled receptors, MT1 and MT2, which are involved in multiple signaling cascades of cell protection and survival (Liu et al. 2016). Both in the CNS and peripheral organs melatonin receptors are ubiquitously distributed (Ekmekcioglu 2006; Ng et al. 2017). Unfortunately, we must assume our current ignorance of the mechanisms by which MT1 and MT2 may influence melatonin-mediated signaling in the brain of patients afflicted by COVID-19. However, melatonin receptor‐mediated protection has been suggested against the lethal viral diseases such as the Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus (Valero et al. 2009) as well as in the improvement of antioxidative defense system against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Huang et al. 2010).",
            "It has been reported that 1/3 patients with confirmed COVID-19 present acute cerebrovascular disease and epilepsy, among other neurological symptoms (Jin et al. 2020; Mao et al. 2020). It is also known that COVID-19 patients might develop a “cytokine storm syndrome” due to an exacerbated level of pro-inflammatory biomarkers which contribute to significantly increase the risk of ischemic stroke. In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 may enter the CNS via the haematogenous diffusion and infect the endothelial cells of the BBB. It is important to note that melatonin may elicit part of its neuroprotective effect through melatonin receptors, and in this context MT2 upregulation would not only preserve BBB integrity but also attenuate the activation of astrocytes and microglia (Lee et al. 2010). Indeed, downregulation of the hippocampal MT2 receptor has been shown to confer protection against seizures and also exhibited the anticonvulsant activity of melatonin (Stewart and Leung 2005). Additionally, T lymphocytes seem to be more vulnerable against SARS-CoV-2 infection through S protein and CD147 (Wang et al. 2020a, b), an extracellular matrix metalloproteinase that induces the pro-inflammatory cytokine cyclophilin A, secreted by monocytes/macrophages and endothelial cells. T lymphocytes express both melatonin receptors, MT1 and MT2 (Pozo et al. 2004; Slominski et al. 2012), and hence, in the infected T cells melatonin may regulate the immunostimulatory activity mediated by MT1 and MT2 and block cyclophilin A/CD147 signaling pathway (Su et al. 2016). For these reasons, in the search for new pharmacological strategies against COVID-19, we focused our attention on the exogenous supplementation with melatonin to preserve the immune response and counteract the neuroinflammation through its widely distributed receptors in the CNS and most of the immune cells.",
            "All countries are suffering the scourge of COVID-19. Unfortunately, science is still learning the natural history and pathogenicity of this emerging coronavirus as well as its immediate and devastating effects on human health. We should ask ourselves, what will be the long-term consequences of COVID-19? Lippi and co-workers (Lippi et al. 2020) have proposed the possibility that months or years after infection several tissues, including the brain, patients may suffer an accelerated aging, which could manifest in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease. Something that seems epidemiologically proven is that the most susceptible people to SARS-CoV-2 infection are the middle-aged and elderly. Based on this clinical evidence, we hypothesize that, at least partially, the progressive melatonin decline with age may account for the apparent increased COVID-19 sensitivity over life-span and specially in the elderly. As a consequence of aging, the pineal gland accumulates calcium deposits and both serum and CSF melatonin release decreases (Reiter et al. 1981, 2014), which is being increasingly related with numerous dysfunctions and pathophysiological changes (Karasek 2004). The involvement of melatonin in the context of neurodegeneration is promising since it has been well documented to counteract most of the physiopathological events that trigger neurodegenerative disorders (Ramos et al. 2020). Interestingly, a certain relationship between nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and infectivity by SARS-CoV-2 is suspected. However, this raises the controversy about whether it is a facilitating effect because nicotine would promote SARS-CoV-2 cell penetration through nAChRs upregulation (nAChRs) (Kabbani and Olds 2020) or the opposite by the low prevalence of smokers among COVID-19 people in China (Guan et al. 2020) or the hypothesized competition of nicotine and SARS-CoV-2 for binding nAChR (Changeux et al. 2020). Thereby, a putative role of nAChRs in the modulation of ACE2 has been suggested at cardiovascular level (Oakes et al. 2018) and presently it should be considered a possible interplay between both ACE2 and overexpressed nAChRs in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and neuroinfection. At this point, melatonin becomes relevant by the modulation of neuroinflammation (Niranjan et al. 2012) and oxidative stress (Parada et al. 2014) through the alpha 7 acetylcholine nicotinic receptor (α7nAChR), which oligomers are among the most frequent in the brain (Gotti and Clementi 2004) and mediate many of the beneficial actions of the indoleamine including mitochondrial regulation. It is also noteworthy that the COVID-19 may impact on the neurotransmission process. Using a multiexperiment matrix Nataf (Nataf 2020) has shown a significant co-expression of ACE2 and Dopa Decarboxylase (DDC), which may explain that any SARS‐CoV-2‐induced downregulation of ACE2 expression, previously reported for SARS-CoV (Kuba et al. 2005), might disrupt the dopamine and serotonin synthesis pathway. Subsequently, the depletion of these neurotransmitters in blood and brain may reduce the serotonin-dependent melatonin availability. However, this hypothesis should be corroborated and correlated in COVID-19 patients affected by generalized anxiety disorder and depressive symptoms (Huang and Zhao 2020).",
            "To our knowledge, some clinical trials of melatonin in COVID-19 that are currently underway have recently been authorized. Among them, the trial EudraCT: 2020-001808-42 has been just approved by the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS 2020), trying to identify the doses of melatonin that can be effective in treating the disease. The study is a phase II, single-center, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial, with the objective to address the efficacy and safety of intravenous melatonin administration in ICU patients suffering from COVID-19. Likewise, the State University of New York at Buffalo is sponsoring “Safety and Efficacy of Melatonin in Outpatients Infected With COVID-19 (COVID-19)”, a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of melatonin in outpatient adult patients suspected to be afflicted with COVID-19. Another example of an interventional clinical trial is provided by Brazil, one of the countries most dramatically hit by the pandemic. The Associação Fundo de Incentivo à Pesquisa is carrying out the trial “Adjuvant Therapeutic Effects of Melatonin Agonist on Hospitalized Patients With Confirmed or Suspected COVID-19” to reduce the lung burden of COVID-19 testing the efficacy of melatonin agonist ramelteon in hospitalized patients.",
            "Nevertheless, determining the safety and the precise doses of this molecule to prescribe are challenges still to be fulfilled. When orally administered, melatonin has a low and variable bioavailability ranging into 3–33% (Andersen et al. 2016c; Di et al. 1997; Harpsoe et al. 2015). Moreover, brain is the organ where melatonin reaches lower concentration after its administration, which could justify the use of higher doses to counteract the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 (Andersen et al. 2016b). In this regard, a new melatonin galenic formulation with a higher bioavailability and faster absorption through the CNS would be required, such as intravenous (IV) (Peschechera and Veronesi 2020) or intranasal administration (García-García et al. 2016; Zetner et al. 2016).",
            "Even though there are not sufficient short- or long-term studies with exogenous melatonin focused on clarifying clinical safety (Seabra et al. 2000), a significant number of studies and clinical trials indicated that the melatonin is safe, even at doses 100 times higher than physiological concentrations (Andersen et al. 2016a, 2016b; Brzezinski 1997; Nickkholgh et al. 2011; Seabra et al. 2000). Then, what are the recommended melatonin dosing regimens in COVID-19 patients? The answer would depend on the administration route and formulation. Reiter et al. (Reiter et al. 2020a) have recently proposed a dose of 40 mg/day orally to control the spread of the disease. In this regard, we hypothesized for COVID-19 patients in hyperinflammation phase an oral dose of 100 mg/day or that at least 1 mg/kg b.w would be required to establish whether melatonin inhibits the neuro-impact of SARS-CoV-2, especially among patients with severe neurological pathologies. However, the authors are not unaware of some potential risks reported for low/medium doses of this indoleamine, as has been the case in a few patients with coronary artery disease receiving 5 mg of melatonin before bedtime for a few weeks or months, who developed non-optimal arterial hypertension side effects (Rechciński et al. 2010), perhaps due to hormone interference with antihypertensive pharmacotherapy (Lusardi et al. 2000). These potential risks must be carefully warned considering that individuals affected by previous cardiovascular comorbidity often develop particularly acute and life-threatening forms of COVID-19 (Nishiga et al. 2020). Also, worth mentioning in order to schedule melatonin with null risk is to attend its possible synergy with other hypnotic-sedative pharmacopoeia, as short-term potentiation has been described for melatonin (2 mg) and zolpidem co-administration (Otmani et al. 2008) or other Z-drugs (Frisher et al. 2016). However, the reported adverse side effects of oral melatonin have been minor, sporadic of easy clinical management (Foley and Steel 2019). Melatonin co-administration with other drugs is also an attractive strategy to improve the management of patients with COVID-19 and reducing the possible drug side effects. Accordingly, the potential of melatonin as an adjuvant treatment (Zhang et al. 2020), as well as its combination with mercaptopurine (Zhou et al. 2020a, b) and other therapy protocols (El-Missiry et al. 2020) had been suggested as a feasible therapy against SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Since the effective vaccine and antiviral drugs are still unavailable, it is critically important to look for an alternative strategy for COVID-19 treatment. To this aim, melatonin is a serious candidate to consider because it shows a low toxicity risk and the pharmacological efficacy needed for the preventive treatment of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, neurophysiological actions from which the clinical management and outcome of COVID-19 patients could benefit. It is time, therefore, to translate the therapeutic capacities of melatonin for the improvement of clinical practice and protection of public health in the current COVID-19 outbreak.",
            "The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has stressed the public health systems until unprecedented limits. The socio-economic consequences are expected to be terrible worldwide and, most important, a health threat has spread across the planet. Faced with this panorama, people are reacting with panic to SARS-CoV-2 infection since several issues have to be solving. (i) The mechanisms associated with the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 are not clear and their elucidation is urgently needed. (ii) SARS-CoV-2 causes different symptoms in different people and a biological explanation is lacking. (iii) Clinicians are still unsure whether people infected with COVID-19 can be reinfected. (iv) The lack of effective vaccines and specific antiviral drugs targeted at SARS-CoV-2 makes COVID-19 difficult for treating and controlling the pandemic. And (v) what will the long-term health consequences of affected COVID-19 patients be? Given the current scenario of such an uncertain future facing us at the present time, we emphasize that further investigation in the treatment with melatonin is urgently required, as well as that clinical trials are strongly needed for the best understanding of the impact of its administration in patients affected by COVID-19.",

            "Since the start of the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, an international effort has sought to better characterize associated extra-pulmonary health sequelae. The acute and or chronic detrimental impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mental health, especially depression, is increasingly described. Simultaneously the pandemic has influenced depressive symptomatology by modifying economic, social and political structures, in addition to affecting daily routines. In both cases, associated immunological perturbations favoring a pro-inflammatory state could underlie an increased risk for depressive symptomatology. A resultant elevation in global depressive burden could further tax mental health care infrastructure and contribute to a range of worse health outcomes including diminished quality of life. This suggests a critical and time-sensitive need to better understand immune interfaces between depression and COVID-19.",
            "The unprecedented spread of SARS-CoV-2 has created a global emphasis on the immune system and its role in COVID-19 disease risk, outcomes and therapeutics (1). Yet the importance of immunity in human health has increasingly expanded beyond infectious diseases. Alterations in immunological activation are now recognized for their role in diverse disease states (2–4). Cytological patterns of innate and adaptive immunity can indicate severity of disease burden and risk for complications in infectious and non-infectious conditions (5, 6). In the field of mental health, various immune cell and cytokine subsets are implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, anxiety and depression (7, 8). Among these data, an immunologic milieu characterized by elevated systemic inflammation has been repeatedly associated with the development of depressive symptomatology (9).",
            "Prior to SARS-CoV-2, depression was already a worldwide epidemic with considerable negative impact on morbidity and mortality. It is estimated that globally 350 million people are affected by depression, and it is a leading cause of disability (10, 11). In addition to lowered quality of life, depression may also contribute to a shortened lifespan (12). Over the last century, a variety of hypotheses have explored biological underpinnings of depression and potential opportunities for treatment and prevention. Alterations in immunological pathways, especially increased low-grade systemic inflammation, are now the subject of extensive academic research (13). In a subset of patients with depression, elevated systemic inflammation is proposed to play a substantial role in disease pathogenesis (14).",
            "COVID-19 has the potential to induce widespread immunological effects as a direct result of infection and indirectly, independent of infection by modifying behavior and thought patterns. This may preferentially shift the immunological milieu toward an inflammatory state and predispose to higher rates of depressive symptomatology. The present review focuses on immune pathways linking COVID-19 infection with risk for depression as well as putative non-infectious immune mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 could increase depressive burden (Figure 1).",
            "Immunological pathways linking depression and COVID-19: Two convergent pathways connect the COVID-19 pandemic with altered immune function and depression. These include direct immunological implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection and indirect, non-infectious pandemic-related changes in immune function induced by poor diet, sedentary behavior and psychological stress. Both pathways may act to increase risk for depression by elevation of CNS cytokines and subsequently microglial activation, altered tryptophan metabolism and deficits in neuroplasticity and neurogenesis.",
            "As the data around short and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic accumulate, evidence suggests an urgent need to focus on neuropsychiatric sequelae. Though over 1,800 publications jointly mention COVID-19 and depression, fewer than 100 discuss the terms “immunity,” “depression” and “COVID-19.” Themes in these articles include: the role of complementary therapies, the beneficial role of physical activity, and pharmacological consideration and bidirectional interactions between COVID-19 and depression with a focus on stress, cytokine storm, and long-term depressive outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "The extant research includes mention of several complementary therapies purported to target shared immunological pathways in depression and COVID-19. These include the use of Ayurveda (15) traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (16), and dietary interventions of curcumin (17) and omega-3 fatty acids (18). The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (19) and oxytocin (20) in COVID-19 have also been considered for their immunomodulatory and mood-related properties, and the importance of exercise as an immunomodulator and potential anti-depressive has also been described (21).",
            "Two recent reviews have focused specifically on molecular mechanisms linking immunity, COVID-19 and depression. In the first (22)) the authors emphasize parallel pathways of kynurenine (KYN) pathway activation by COVID-19 cytokine storm and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor effects in increased risk for depression. In the second (23), the authors emphasize the role of cytokine storm in potential psychological outcomes from COVID-19. Related molecular pathways are also briefly discussed in a recent cohort analysis (24).",
            "Worldwide, millions of cases of the infectious disease SARS-CoV-2 have been reported (25), accompanied by a near universal exposure to political, social and economic ripple effects. Early in the course of the pandemic, the immunological effects of the virus on human physiology were characterized by respiratory symptoms including severe pneumonia (26). In the coming months, extra-pulmonary manifestations of the virus were better described. These included cardiovascular, metabolic, hematologic, neurologic and dermatologic pathologies (27). Additional research highlighted a tax on mental health as a potential consequence of acute infection (28).",
            "Academic and public focus has also expanded to the long-term effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human health (29). This has been called “post-acute COVID-19” or “long COVID” (30). Those who experience persistent symptoms for weeks or months after acute infection number in the thousands, and have created Facebook self-help groups, adopting the terminology “Long-Haul COVID” to describe their ongoing battle with health issues including worse cognition, low exercise tolerance, sleep problems, autonomic dysfunction as well as worsened mental health and autoimmunities (31–33). A recent study (34) more explicitly linked depressive psychopathology 3 months after hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia with elevated baseline scores on an index of immune activation and inflammation.",
            "Finally, attention has increasingly turned to the indirect ramifications of the virus. In globally disrupting routines, the economy, access to care and social dynamics, the pandemic could alter health outcomes for billions. Early data suggest these impacts may prove especially relevant for mental health. Health care workers managing COVID-19 patients in China reported increased psychological strain, including higher rates of depressive symptoms (35). A population-based analysis of depressive symptoms in the US found a 3-fold increase in symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before (36). In a recent survey of 130 countries, the World Health Organization (37) reported widespread disruption of mental health service for vulnerable populations (25). Patients with preexisting mental health and physical health conditions may be at particular risk for pandemic-related depression, and low social support and socioeconomic position may also confer increased risk (38). Additionally depression may itself confer heightened risk for further immune-mediated depressive symptoms through increased vulnerability to inflammatory immune activation after psychosocial stress (39). A summary of recently published themes linking COVID-19, immunity and depression can be found in Figure 2.",
            "Summary of existing literature relating COVID-19, depression and immunity. Proposed mechanisms triggering depression related to COVID-19 include elevated inflammation (best represented in cytokine storm), pathways related to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, decreased physical activity and increased psychological stress. Proposed interventions include a range of complementary therapies as well as pharmaceutical [(SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and oxytocin] in addition to increasing physical activity.",
            "Early evidence that inflammation could precipitate depressive symptoms was derived from hepatitis patients receiving immunotherapy with interferon alpha. Many of these patients developed psychiatric symptoms including symptoms of depression (40). Subsequent research showed that administration of low-dose endotoxin (e.g., lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) increases systemic markers of inflammation including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and symptoms of depression (41). Research additionally demonstrates correlation between elevated inflammatory cytokines and depressive symptoms (9), and increased levels of the inflammatory markers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and IL-6 have been shown to be risk factors for subsequent depression (42, 43).",
            "Brain alterations are central to the current understanding of depression pathophysiology (44). However, the brain is generally regarded as having immune privilege, which limits its exposure to peripheral immune states including inflammation (45). It is now understood that there are three methods by which peripheral inflammation may reach and influence the brain (46). These include cytokine passage through the blood brain barrier (BBB), cytokine activation of peripheral afferent nerve fibers returning to the central nervous system (CNS) and the trafficking of immune cells into the brain. In addition, CNS immune function can be directly activated when antigens enter thorough cranial nerves. For example, pathogens may reach the CNS by way of the olfactory and trigeminal nerves (45), and vagal afferent fibers convey immune-modulating signals from gut bacteria to the brain (46).",
            "In investigating the SARS-CoV-2 virus, research efforts have focused on the role of pre-existing immunological states as well as immune changes subsequent to infection. Direct correlations between COVID-19 outcomes and individual cytokines and immune cell populations indicate symptoms of COVID-19 are associated with elevations in interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, interleukin 10 (IL-10), and TNFα), as well as a general lymphopenia (47–49). Increased IL-6 may especially correlate with severity of COVID-19 (50).",
            "An infection-related surge in proinflammatory mediators in COVID-19 has been called the cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome. While consensus on the exact definition of the cytokine storm is debated, it is characterized by elevation in a range of immunological markers including interleukins, interferon-γ, TNF, chemokines and plasma proteins including complement and C-reactive protein (CRP) (51). In cytokine storm, hyperactivation of the inflammatory immune response may lead to significant collateral damage including respiratory distress, renal failure, liver injury and cardiomyopathy as well as neuropsychiatric issues (51). Up to 40% of people with COVID-19 have been reported to experience significant central nervous system (CNS) symptoms (52).",
            "At this time, the precise methods by which the SARS-CoV-2 virus influences the CNS remain unclear. However, the widely cited symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia suggest a high prevalence of CNS involvement (53), potentially via retrograde olfactory nerve transport (54). Research in prior coronaviruses has demonstrated coronavirus RNA in the human brain, suggesting a degree of neuroinvasion despite the virus's label as a respiratory pathogen (54). Peripheral immunological activation as a result of COVID-19 could also reach the CNS by transport through or disruption of the BBB (55, 56).",
            "On entering the CNS, peripherally generated inflammatory mediators may amplify their effects on the brain by acting on microglial cells. Microglial activation represents a transition from a state of relative quiescence to a “primed” state in which the microglia increase production of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators (57). Microglia are implicated in both acute and chronic neurological complications of COVID-19 infection (58), and increased microglial activation has been demonstrated in post-mortem neuropathological analysis of brain samples from COVID-19 patients (59, 60).",
            "Those with existing neuroimmunological diseases may have heightened vulnerability to depressive symptomatology as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, people with multiple sclerosis demonstrated elevated rates of psychological distress including depression after easing of lockdown measures (61). Parkinson's disease has been strongly correlated with neuroimmune alterations including increased neuroinflammation (62), and a recent survey demonstrated high rates of depressive symptomatology in this demographic (63). Additionally, patients with preexisting psychiatric diagnoses have been found to experience high rates of psychiatric symptoms including those related to depression in the context of COVID-19 lockdown measures, and immunological mechanisms have been proposed as a potential contributor (64).",
            "Data demonstrating the long-term impact of COVID-19 on neuroimmune function remain limited. However, early survey results suggest that after acute infection, some experience residual symptoms of including fatigue, headache and anosmia, indicating a degree of persistent neurological alteration (65). Animal research implies a possibility for coronavirus-mediated neuronal damage as a result of alterations in glutamate homeostasis as well as potential for T cell-mediated demyeliation in susceptible hosts (66). SARS-CoV-2 infiltration of the olfactory bulb and subsequent polarization of microglial cells toward an inflammatory phenotype has also been proposed as a mechanism promoting neurodegenerative disease (67). As microglia mediate multiple neurological processes, chronic alterations in microglial populations as a result of COVID-19 could have significant impact on multiple health outcomes including depression. While much investigative focus has been on direct links between viral infection and neuroimmune alterations in otherwise healthy individuals, those with existing neuroimmunological conditions may be especially vulnerable to non-infectious psychological stressors stemming from the pandemic.",
            "Neuroplasticity describes neural synaptic reorganization in response to environmental input. It is thought to form the basis for memory and learning (68). Impaired neuroplasticity is implicated in the pathogenesis of depression (69), a mechanism supported by alterations in brain functional connectivity (70) as well as loss of synapse-related genes and synapses in postmortem brain tissue of patients with depression (71).",
            "Immune function is thought to exert a degree of control over neuroplasticity (72). This may occur in a dose-dependent manner with opposing effects at extremes of immune activation, as a low basal level of neuroinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNFα appears necessary for healthy neuroplasticity, with suppression at higher levels (73).",
            "As regulators of CNS immunity, microglial cells are implicated in neuroplasticity. Microglia are thought to influence this process through glutamate homeostasis and production of inflammatory cytokines (74). On detection of homeostatic disturbance (e.g., metabolic, stress-related and pathogen-induced signals), microglia become activated, proliferating and producing inflammatory mediators (75). This may present a convergent mechanism by which peripheral immune activation and psychosocial stress could induce neuroinflammation, defects in neuroplasticity and eventually, depression.",
            "Neurogenesis is the process of creating new neurons. Once thought restricted to early life, human research now shows that neurogenesis occurs in discrete zones of the brain into adulthood, including the hippocampus and lateral ventricle (76, 77). Like neuroplasticity, neurogenesis may underlie mechanisms of learning and memory (78). The neurogenesis hypothesis of depression proposes changes in the rate of neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in the pathophysiology of the disease (77).",
            "Neuroplasticity and neurogenesis are affected by neurotrophic factors, compounds that bind to tyrosine kinase receptors and augment neuronal function, survival and development (79). Of these, much research has specifically focused on the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its role in neuroplasticity, neurogenesis and depression (80, 81). Lowered levels of BDNF protein and BDNF gene expression are reported in both post-mortem brain tissue and in peripheral blood from depressed patients (82), and BDNF is increased by antidepressant therapies ranging from conventional antidepressants to electro-convulsive treatment (ECT) (83, 84).",
            "Immunity plays a role in both BDNF expression and function. Administration of LPS reliably induces inflammation, including in the CNS (85). In animal models, LPS increases expression of inflammatory markers in the hippocampus and microglia (86) and decreases levels of BDNF (87). It is also notable that microglial cells regulate release of BDNF (88).",
            "The aforementioned pathway suggests a molecular mechanism by which infection with COVID-19 could directly downregulate levels of BDNF. However, non-infectious effects of the pandemic may also play a role, as chronic stress is thought to have a deleterious effect on BDNF expression (89). This implies that healthy neuroplasticity and neurogenesis may be compromised as a result of infection and psychological stressors generated by COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "Decreased brain bioavailability of the tryptophan (TRP) metabolite serotonin (5-HT) underpins the psychopharmacology of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants (90). TRP metabolites including 5-HT engage in bidirectional interactions with the immune system.",
            "5-HT may directly influence immune homeostasis by suppressing Th17 differentiation, increasing expression of T regulatory cells (Tregs) and promoting M2-polarization of macrophages (91). These immunological changes favor decreased inflammation and may speak to a role for serotonin in mediating inflammation-associated depressive symptoms.",
            "More robust research focuses on the effects of immunity on TRP metabolism, including 5-HT availability. Enzymatic action on the essential amino acid TRP determines whether it is converted in 5-HT or shunted into the kynurenine (KYN) pathway. In general, the majority of tryptophan enters the KYN pathway, creating downstream metabolites including KYN, kynurenic acid (KYNA) and quinolinic acid (QUIN) (92).",
            "Initiating enzymes in the KYN pathway are tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Notably, IDO is highly expressed in immune cells (93) and compared to TDO it is far more responsive to immunological signals (94). In the context of elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and TNFα, IDO converts TRP to KYN, and shunts available TRP away from 5-HT production (95). Conversely, anti-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-10 deactivate the IDO enzyme (96, 97). Recently, it has been proposed that by inducing cytokine storm and downregulating ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may increase levels of KYN pathways metabolites in the brain, increasing risk for depression (22).",
            "The relative increase in KYN pathway activation as a result of inflammatory immune activation has been proposed to contribute to depression through 5-HT depletion, though more recent focus has shifted to the differential neuroactive effects of KYN metabolites (96). For example, KYNA may exert anti-depressant effects through N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist mechanisms resembling those of ketamine, while the NMDA agonist QUIN may have pro-depressive effects (96). While individual human trials are variable, there is some support for a decrease in KYNA and an increase in QUIN levels in depression (98).",
            "In sum, an elevation in systemic inflammation as the direct result of infection with SARS-CoV-2 or as a result of pandemic-related behavioral changes and psychological stressors could predispose to relative brain 5-HT depletion and imbalance in KYN pathway metabolites that increase risk for depression (Figure 3).",
            "In the context of elevated inflammatory cytokines as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, CNS tryptophan (TRP) may be preferentially converted into kynurenine (KYN) and its metabolites including kynurenic acid (KYNA) and quinolinic acid (QUIN). This may decrease availability of serotonin (5-HT). KYN metabolites may also contribute to depression. When anti-inflammatory cytokines are present, TRP may be preferentially converted into 5-HT.",
            "Increased psychological stress has been widely documented in response to COVID-19. Personal diagnosis of or the diagnosis of a close contact with COVID-19 have each been associated with elevated stress as well as with increased symptoms of depression (99). Political measures taken to reduce the spread of the virus have been associated with elevated stress internationally (100, 101). Exposure to content related to COVID-19 has also been linked to increased psychological stress. In a survey of American adults without prior history of a mental health condition, 15% reported 2 symptoms of psychological distress for at least 3 days in the past week, most commonly the sense of feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge (102). These symptoms were positively associated with social media and internet engagement with coronavirus content. Widespread food scarcity and economic instability as a result of the pandemic also pose a significant risk for elevated psychological stress (103).",
            "Alterations in stress pathways including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) are known risk factors for mental health conditions including anxiety and depression (104, 105). Early life exposure to major life stressors predicts a higher chance of developing depression in adulthood (106). At a cellular and molecular level, multiple stress-related alterations are seen in depression, including changes in levels of stress hormones, receptor expression of neurons and HPA responsiveness to glucocorticoids (107–109). These changes may exert their effects on mood by way of immune modulation in the CNS (110).",
            "Elevated psychological stress is proposed to induce immunological alterations through a variety of dose and duration-dependent mechanisms. Acute as well as chronic psychosocial stressors are associated with elevated inflammation (111). Acute stress correlates with elevation in plasma IL-6, TNFα, IL-1β and IL-10, while chronic stress has been linked to low-grade inflammatory activation including elevations in CRP, IL-6 and TNFα (111, 112). It is particularly topical that caregiving stress correlates with elevations in IL-6, while teacher burnout has been correlated with systemic inflammation along a continuum of symptom severity (Rohelder, 2019) (113).",
            "Compared with acute stressors, chronic stress may better predict the low-grade inflammatory immune activation correlated with depression (114). Proposed linking mechanisms include glucocorticoid receptor resistance and subsequent inability to down-regulate inflammatory pathways as well as stress-induced production of inflammatory cytokines from visceral fat (115). Visceral fat expresses high levels of stress-related adrenergic receptors and produces pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNFα and IL-6 (116). Chronic stress may additionally cause microglia to adopt a pro-inflammatory phenotype, contributing to neuroinflammation (117). Inflammation may in part be mediated through stress activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (118). Taken together, multiple mechanisms link COVID-19 pandemic-related psychological stress with an inflammatory immune state that could promote depressive symptomatology.",
            "COVID-19 related restrictions have sparked concern for decreased physical activity. In a recent survey of American adults, people active prior to COVID-19 restrictions reported a 32% reduction in physical activity (119). It is also notable that in this report, increased inactivity correlated with an increase in depressive symptoms. Similar results in American children suggest a decrease in physical activity and increase in sedentary activity since the spread of the pandemic within the United States (120).",
            "Physical activity has been shown to be an effective therapy for unipolar depression, with a benefit comparable to antidepressants and psychotherapy (121, 122). Recently, existing data have been supplemented by Mendelian randomization techniques showing a potential causative role for the protective effect of physical activity in depression (123).",
            "Physical activity is thought to positively affect multiple aspects of immune function, with a beneficial suppressive effect on inflammation (124). As exercise induces a transient elevation in inflammatory markers, these effects can appear paradoxical, and various explanations have been proposed. While acute exercise may rapidly increase inflammation, including levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1), TNFα and IL-6, these muscle-derived cytokines (myokines) may have local anti-inflammatory effect (125, 126). Though exercise increases IL-6 in the CNS, this is accompanied by a decrease in TNFα (127). It is suggested that IL-6 may therefore act as an anti-inflammatory cytokine in regions of the CNS by inhibiting TNFα, with an overall protective effect on neurons. Finally, exercise-induced elevation in inflammatory cytokines may be systemically balanced by a parallel increases in anti-inflammatory molecules, leading to a net anti-inflammatory effect (128).",
            "Early research during the COVID-19 pandemic suggests the potential for a negative impact on dietary patterns, potentially as a response to increased chronic stress and changes in habits (129, 130). For example, an increased consumption of “comfort foods” has been reported in response to COVID-19 (131). A survey of Italians found that unhealthy dietary choices were driven in part by a desire to alleviate poor mental health (132).",
            "In both children and adults, data indicate a COVID-19-related increase in intake of prototypically inflammatory foods including refined carbohydrates and sugary drinks and in adults, a decreased intake of fish and fruit (133–135). This change suggests that in response to the pandemic, there may a trend toward a Western pattern diet, which predicts higher levels of inflammatory markers including CRP and IL-6 (136) as well as increased risk for depression (137).",
            "Dietary influences on immune function are diverse. The role of macro and micronutrient deficiency in immune dysfunction is well-characterized, and dietary fiber, omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols are also purported to play a role in healthier immune function (138). Conversely, preclinical data suggest a deficit in dietary fiber could promote lower levels of Treg cells (139). Increased dietary saturated fat may facilitate inflammation by activation of the toll-like receptor (TLR4) signaling pathway, while omega-3 fats have the opposing effect (140). Additionally, immunity may be affected by changes in the gut microbiome (141) as well as more acutely by a lipid, glucose or dietary LPS-mediated postprandial inflammatory response (142). In the context of the aforementioned, it is notable that interventional trials promoting dietary patterns rich in whole foods and low in refined carbohydrates, fast foods, sweetened drinks and processed meats have demonstrated efficacy in decreasing depressive symptoms as well as in lowering inflammatory burden (143–146).",
            "As a whole, these data suggest that changes in dietary patterns may represent a behavioral variable in inflammatory modulation, and that psychological stress-mediated trends during COVID-19 could have a detrimental effect on mood by increasing preference for less healthful foods. Emphasis on the consumption of a less processed diet and increased access to more nutrient-rich foods could represent a potential offset to diet-related immunological effects on depressive symptoms as a result of the pandemic.",
            "Depression and COVID-19 demonstrate shared patterns of immunological function, especially around a pro-inflammatory state characterized by elevation in cytokines including IL-6, TNFα, and IL-1β. SARS-CoV-2 may increase immunological risk for depression through direct infection-related influences on the CNS, or through associated behavioral shifts in diet, physical activity and psychological stress which subsequently promote an inflammatory immune state. Insight into the immunological intersections between depression and SARS-CoV-2 may help in the creation of strategies to mitigate of depression risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "Neurologic manifestations are an immediate consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, which, however, may also trigger long-term neurological effects. Notably, COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms show elevated levels of biomarkers associated with brain injury, including Tau proteins linked to Alzheimer’s pathology. Studies in brain organoids revealed that SARS-CoV-2 alters the phosphorylation and distribution of Tau in infected neurons, but the mechanisms are currently unknown. We hypothesize that these pathological changes are due to the recruitment of Tau into stress granules (SGs) operated by the nucleocapsid protein (NCAP) of SARS-CoV-2. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether NCAP interacts with Tau and localizes to SGs in hippocampal neurons in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we tested whether SUMOylation, a posttranslational modification of NCAP and Tau, modulates their distribution in SGs and their pathological interaction. We found that NCAP and Tau colocalize and physically interact. We also found that NCAP induces hyperphosphorylation of Tau and causes cognitive impairment in mice infected with NCAP in their hippocampus. Finally, we found that SUMOylation modulates NCAP SG formation in vitro and cognitive performance in infected mice. Our data demonstrate that NCAP induces Tau pathological changes both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that SUMO2 ameliorates NCAP-induced Tau pathology, highlighting the importance of the SUMOylation pathway as a target of intervention against neurotoxic insults, such as Tau oligomers and viral infection.",
            "While initially recognized for its respiratory effects, emerging research suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can affect various organs, including the central nervous system (CNS) [1]. Patients with COVID-19 commonly experience acute neurological symptoms like changes in smell and taste, along with persistent cognitive issues such as fatigue, headaches, attention problems, difficulty breathing, and cognitive decline (referred to as “brain fog”). This neurological aspect, termed “neuro-COVID” poses a significant global health concern, affecting even those with mild COVID-19 symptoms [2]. The underlying mechanisms behind this post-viral syndrome are multifaceted, potentially involving factors like reduced oxygen levels [3], disruption of the blood–brain barrier, and, notably, direct invasion [4] and damage to neuronal tissues by SARS-CoV-2 [5].",
            "Recent evidence confirms the virus’s ability to target the nervous system, causing structural changes in the brain and metabolic alterations in survivors [6]. Ongoing studies are beginning to explore the link between COVID-19 and neurodegenerative conditions, suggesting that the virus may worsen existing dementia or predispose individuals to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [7]. Notably, COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms show elevated levels of biomarkers associated with brain injury, including Tau proteins linked to Alzheimer’s pathology [8,9].",
            "Despite these findings, the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 directly infects neurons or indirectly affects them through non-neuronal cell infection remains uncertain. A study in brain organoids revealed that SARS-CoV-2 alters the phosphorylation and distribution of Tau in infected neurons [10], but the mechanisms are currently unknown.",
            "We hypothesize that these pathological changes are due to the recruitment of Tau into stress granules (SGs) operated by the nucleocapsid protein (NCAP) of SARS-CoV-2.",
            "The NCAP of coronaviruses plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle [11]. NCAP primarily binds to viral RNA, forms the viral nucleocapsid, and facilitates viral genome replication and transcription [12]. Studies have suggested that the nucleocapsid protein of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, may interact with SGs [13,14]. SGs are cellular structures that form in response to various stress conditions, such as viral infection [15], oxidative stress, or heat shock [16]. The interaction between the NCAP and SGs may influence cellular processes, including the host cell’s ability to mount an effective antiviral response.",
            "Interestingly, SUMOylation has emerged as an essential pathway that is manipulated by viruses to modulate antiviral responses [17], viral replication and pathogenesis [18], and the modulation of SG dynamics [19,20]. The process of SUMOylation is a multi-step cascade, where a Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO) is covalently attached to a conserved ΨKxD/E motif within a target protein, altering the function of the modified protein [21,22]. There are three known SUMO paralogs in the brain: SUMO1, -2, and -3, with SUMO1 contributing to tissue damage and SUMO2/-3 ameliorating it [23,24,25,26]. Interestingly, the nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV is a target of SUMOylation [27]. SUMO is conjugated to NCAP at residue 62, and this modification triggers NCAP multimerization [28], a process relevant to binding to RNA for viral packaging [29].",
            "Here, we tested whether SARS-CoV-2 infection and, in particular, the presence of high levels of NCAP may initiate or accelerate neurodegenerative processes, including those involved in AD, as observed for other pathogens [30,31] and suggested by some neurological symptoms that accompany COVID-19 [32,33].",
            "To test whether exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may predispose to developing dementia, we investigated whether NCAP interacts with Tau and induces pathological changes in cell lines, human iPSC-derived cortical neurons, and mouse hippocampal neurons in vivo. Mechanistically, we tested whether posttranslational modification of NCAP and Tau by SUMO2 modulates their distribution in SGs and their pathological interaction.",
            "Our data demonstrate that NCAP induces pathological changes in human neurons and animals expressing wild-type Tau and aggravates the pathology in neurons expressing mutant forms of Tau, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that SUMO2 conjugation ameliorates NCAP-induced Tau pathology and directly reduces NCAP granules.",
            "Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may trigger molecular processes that disrupt Tau’s normal function, potentially contributing to neurological complications observed in COVID-19 patients. Our work also highlights the importance of the SUMOylation pathway as a target of intervention against neurotoxic insults, such as Tau oligomers and viral infection.",
            "SUMOylation has emerged as an essential pathway that is manipulated by viruses to modulate antiviral responses, viral replication, and pathogenesis [34]. The NCAP of SARS-CoV1 is a target of SUMOylation at the K62 residue, where the conjugation of SUMO1 promotes its oligomerization [27], and, more recently, the NCAP of SARS-CoV-2 was also reported to be a target of SUMO3 at the K65 residue [35]. Like the NCAP from SARS-CoV1, SUMOylation is also critical for SARS-CoV-2 NCAP self-association and phase-separated condensate formation [36], affecting NCAP activity.",
            "Here, we tested whether the pharmacological modulation of SUMOylation resulted in changes in NCAP phase-separated condensate formation. First, we expressed NCAP-GFP in N2a mouse neuronal cells and found that NCAP-GFP had a mostly diffused appearance, with only one or a few condensates per cell (Figure 1A). To reduce or promote SUMO conjugation, we treated N2a cells expressing NCAP-GFP with either Ginkgolic acid [37] (10 µM) or Ebselen [38] (2 µM), respectively, for 16 h before imaging them. We found that the treatment with Ginkgolic acid significantly increased the number of condensates per cell (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.0001). At the same time, Ebselen significantly reduced the number, suggesting that a global increase in SUMOylation reduces the formation of NCAP condensates. Therefore, from these experiments, we hypothesized that an increase in global SUMOylation by reducing NCAP condensates could be beneficial in cells infected by SARS2-CoV2.",
            "Next, we sought to confirm the effects of NCAP on SG formation using iPSC-derived neurons from AD patients carrying the A246E mutation in presenilin1. Using established protocols, we differentiated iPSCs into glutamatergic neurons for 30 days [39]. At 30 DIV, the cells were transfected with NCAP-GFP and fixed 5 days later to visualize NCAP. We confirmed that NCAP-GFP induced the formation of condensates in the human neurons (Figure 1B), as previously observed in the N2a cells (Figure 1A). These results suggest that NCAP has the ability to induce the formation of SGs in human neurons.",
            "Since our pharmacological treatments in the N2a cells demonstrated that an increase in SUMO conjugation reduced the number of NCAP condensates, we tested whether increased levels of SUMO2 could reproduce the same effects in iPSC-derived human neurons. At 30 DIV, neurons were transfected with NCAP-GFP alone or with SUMO2 and fixed 5 days later to visualize NCAP-GFP condensates. We found that the NCAP-SUMO2-transfected neurons had a significant reduction (p < 0.05 vs. NCAP alone) in the size of condensates and a concomitant increase in the amount of diffused signal (Figure 1B), suggesting that the modulation of SUMOylation can affect the distribution of NCAP in human neurons.",
            "NCAP localizes to SGs [13], biomolecular condensates where Tau was also found to reside [40,41]. The presence of Tau in these organelles is now considered a critical factor in triggering its aggregation [42]. To address whether exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may predispose to developing dementia, we investigated whether NCAP colocalizes and interacts with Tau.",
            "First, we transfected HEK293 cells with NCAP-GFP and found that NCAP induced the formation of molecular condensates that resembled SGs (Figure 2A). To determine the nature of these condensates, 48 h after transfection, we fixed HEK293 cells and stained them with an antibody to detect the stress granule marker G3BP1 [43]. Using confocal microscopy, we found that the G3BP1 colocalized with NCAP (Figure 2A). Next, we co-transfected HEK293 cells with NCAP-GFP plus Tau-Dsred. The cells were fixed and stained with anti-G3BP1 antibodies two days after transfection to determine whether NCAP induced the formation of SGs that recruited Tau. We found that Tau colocalized with NCAP-GFP in condensates (Figure 2B), suggesting that NCAP can recruit Tau into SGs.",
            "To further demonstrate that NCAP and Tau interact, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments on lysates of HEK293 cells expressing NCAP-GFP and Tau-HA, both wild-type and carrying the human mutation P301L, which is associated with frontotemporal dementia [44]. Cells were transfected with NCAP alone, Tau alone, or with both Tau and NCAP. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lyzed, and cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with GFP magnetic beads to pull down NCAP-GFP. Immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized using anti-GFP (for NCAP, Figure 2C) and anti-HA (for Tau, Figure 2D). Wild-type and mutant Tau were co-immunoprecipitated with NCAP, suggesting that mutations on Tau do not affect its ability to interact with NCAP.",
            "A study in brain organoids revealed that SARS-CoV-2 alters the phosphorylation and distribution of Tau in infected neurons [45]. After establishing that NCAP and Tau colocalized into molecular condensates (SG) and that SUMO2 significantly reduced the number of NCAP-induced condensates, we next sought to test whether NCAP could induce pathological changes in Tau in vivo and whether SUMO2 might reduce them. However, infecting mice with competent SARS-CoV-2 particles requires special facilities and safety protocols that are not easily accessible for all research groups. Therefore, to assess the impact of NCAP on Tau in vivo, we opted for expressing only the gene of NCAP and not the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome. To achieve this, we infected JNPL3 mice [46], an animal model of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) carrying the human P301L mutation in the Tau gene, and aged-matched C57 wild-type animals (WT) with adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to express NCAP alone or in combination with SUMO2.",
            "Five-month-old JNPL3 and WT mice with six animals per group (three males and three females) were infected with GFP, NCAP-GFP alone, or NCAP-GFP+SUMO2-RFP viruses in the dorsal hippocampus (Figure 3A). Three months after the injection of the AAVs, the mice were sacrificed, and brains were collected to perform immunohistological analyses and Western blotting (Figure 3B). We found a robust expression of NCAP protein in the mice injected with NCAP-GFP alone and with NCAP-GFP+SUMO2 checked by immunofluorescence with an anti-NCAP antibody, and we detected its hippocampal distribution, together with that of RFP, used as reporters for SUMO2 AAVs (Figure 3B). NCAP and SUMO2 expression was also confirmed by Western blotting (Figure 3D). In particular, we observed an increase in SUMO2 conjugation in the mice injected with NCAP-GFP+SUMO2 viruses compared with the mice injected with either GFP or NCAP alone (Figure 3E).",
            "Next, we assessed if NCAP could induce an increase in the phosphorylation of Tau in the hippocampus of WT and JNPL3 mice. We performed immunofluorescence analyses using antibodies specific to detecting NCAP and phosphorylated Tau at the pathological residues Ser 202 and 205 (AT8), which are associated with AD [15]. We found some AT8-positive cells in the WT mice expressing NCAP (Figure 4A), and the co-expression of SUMO2 reduced the AT8-positive signal. JNPL3 mice already have AT8-reactive neurons in their hippocampus, and NCAP increased the AT8 signal. As for the WT mice, SUMO2 reduced the amount of the AT8 signal in the hippocampus of the JNPL3 mice injected with NCAP. We confirmed these results by performing quantitative Western blotting analyses (Figure 4B,C).",
            "Phosphorylation of Tau is accompanied by cognitive and motor disturbances in animal models of Tauopathies and in AD and FTD patients. Therefore, we next tested whether NCAP could induce cognitive and motor defects in WT and JNPL3 mice.",
            "Our hypothesis was that infection with SARS-CoV-2 may have detrimental effects in the brain and induce neurodegenerative diseases in otherwise healthy subjects or aggravate neurodegeneration in patients already affected by AD or FTD. To test our hypothesis, we assessed motor and cognitive performances in WT and JNPL3 mice injected with GFP, NCAP, or co-injected with NCAP and SUMO2.",
            "Rotarod was performed six weeks (1.5 months) and 3 months after AAV injection (Figure 5A) to assess motor performance. Overall, the JNPL3 mice performed significantly worse than the WT mice (two-way ANOVA; p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0003 for 1.5 and 3 months respectively; Figure 5A). However, post hoc analyses showed that the JNPL3 mice infected with GFP were not significantly different from the WT mice at both time points. Instead, NCAP expression in the JNPL3 mice’s hippocampus significantly worsened their performance (one-way ANOVA; p = 0.003 and p = 0.005 for 1.5 and 3 months respectively; Figure 5B). The co-expression of SUMO2 did not significantly improve the performance 1.5 months after infection. However, three months after infection, the JNPL3 mice expressing SUMO2 performed like the mice expressing GFP (Figure 5B).",
            "The animals were also trained in a Y-maze two months after infection to assess their working memory. In this task, the mice were allowed to explore only one arm of the maze during the training phase, while they were permitted to explore all the arms during the testing phase, which was performed twenty-four hours after training. Cognitively competent mice tend to spend more time and explore first the novel arm. As expected, the JNPL3 mice performed worse than the WT mice (Figure 5C), as demonstrated by the difference in the discrimination index (DI, two-way ANOVA, p = 0.025). Infection with NCAP did not significantly change the DI of the JNPL3 mice, which was already extremely poor. We also examined the frequency of exploring the new arm first (Figure 5D). We found that expression of NCAP in the WT mice significantly reduced the number of mice that chose to explore the new arm first (two-way ANOVA; genotype effect: p = 0.0285, and AAV effect: p = 0.0187; Figure 5D). At the same time, the co-expression of SUMO2 rescued the deficits.",
            "In addition, we also measured the latency to enter the new and old arms, another parameter used to assess the preference of mice toward the new arm. Mice with intact memory will go first to the new arm and, hence, will have lower latency to explore that arm, while they will have longer latency to go to the old arm. This analysis revealed more differences between the different groups. We found that NCAP significantly reduced the performance of the WT animals compared with the WT animals injected with GFP, and we found that that SUMO2 overexpression rescued the cognitive impairment caused by NCAP in the WT mice (two-way ANOVA; AAV effect: p = 0.018, arm effect: p = 0.0006; Figure 5E). Moreover, the JNPL3 mice infected with GFP were already severely impaired, and NCAP did not significantly worsen their performance, but SUMO2 significantly improved it (two-way ANOVA; AAV effect: p = 0.0341, arm effect: not significant; Figure 5E), with post hoc multiple comparison analyses revealing a significant difference between the new and old arm only when the JNPL3 mice were injected with NCAP and SUMO2 (p = 0.035).",
            "Together, these data suggest that NCAP can induce cognitive impairment in WT animals and worsen the cognitive impairment already present in JNPL3 mice and that increasing SUMO2 conjugation can improve or restore cognition.",
            "The main findings of our study are that [1] NCAP expressed in the hippocampal neurons of WT as well as JNPL3 mice induced an increase in Tau phosphorylation, resulting in cognitive impairment, and that [2] an increase in the neuroprotective SUMO2 conjugation improved the behavioral outcomes in the models studied. This protection may be explained by the fact that an increase in SUMO2 conjugation significantly reduced the number and size of NCAP condensates.",
            "Reducing the number of NCAP condensates could be beneficial in the context of viral infection to counteract NCAP’s ability to inhibit host cell signaling for evading innate antiviral immunity, which requires the formation of NCAP condensates.",
            "One of the host responses to arresting viral replication is to form SGs [15], transient cytoplasmic aggregates of mRNA and proteins induced to stop the translation of viral RNAs [16]. To counteract the host response, viruses can sequestrate SG components to promote viral replication [15]. In this context, the ability of NCAP to sequestrate SG components into condensates could be beneficial for the virus.",
            "The induction of SGs is particularly relevant in neuronal cells, since SGs are also emerging as critical players in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [47,48,49]. Several essential proteins associated with these diseases, such as TDP-43, FUS, and Tau, have been found to localize to SGs under stress conditions. Dysregulation of SG dynamics, including aberrant assembly, persistence, or inefficient clearance, may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in these diseases [41,43]. One proposed mechanism is that chronic SG formation could lead to the sequestration of essential RNA-binding proteins and mRNAs, disrupting normal cellular function and potentially contributing to the accumulation of protein aggregates characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases. Also, SGs may impair the clearance of misfolded proteins or exacerbate cellular stress responses, compromising neuronal viability. Therefore, SGs could be a potential juncture between SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and neurodegeneration, and their modulation could offer therapeutic implications.",
            "Interestingly, SUMOylation has emerged as an essential pathway that viruses manipulate to modulate antiviral responses, viral replication and pathogenesis [18], and the modulation of SG dynamics [17].",
            "Several stress-granule-associated proteins are SUMOylated, including RNA-binding proteins such as TIA-1, G3BP1, and hnRNPA1. The SUMOylation of these proteins can impact their localization to SGs, their interactions with other granule components, and their ability to regulate mRNA metabolism and translation within SGs. Furthermore, SUMOylation enzymes, including SUMO E3 ligases and SUMO-specific proteases, have been shown to regulate SG formation and disassembly [19]. For example, SUMO-specific proteases such as SENP3 have been found to regulate SG disassembly by deSUMOylating SG components [19].",
            "Therefore, dysregulation of SUMOylation pathways may impact SG formation and clearance [50], potentially influencing cellular homeostasis and contributing to disease states such as neurodegeneration. Thus, acting on the SUMO pathway could be beneficial in reducing the NCAP-mediated recruitment of SG components.",
            "Our data support this hypothesis. We found that increasing SUMO2 protein and pharmacological treatment with Ebselen to increase SUMO2 conjugation resulted in the disassembly of NCAP condensates. Moreover, overexpression of SUMO2 significantly improved cognitive function in the mice infected with NCAP.",
            "In contrast with our findings, direct SUMOylation of NCAP has been recently proposed to promote NCAP oligomerization and condensate formation, suggesting that SUMOylation of NCAP could be detrimental to infected cells [36].",
            "In fact, the NCAP of SARS-CoV, the first of the new coronaviruses, has already been reported to be a target of SUMOylation [28]. In particular, isoform SUMO1 was found to trigger NCAP oligomerization, a process relevant to binding to RNA for viral packaging.",
            "Interestingly, previous work has focused on the effects of SUMO1 on NCAP oligomerization. While we did not directly test the effects of increasing SUMO1, it has been reported by others that different SUMOs can have different effects on their target proteins [51]. It is therefore conceivable that while SUMO1 increases NCAP oligomerization, SUMO2 instead reduces it. It is also possible that the reduction in NCAP condensates we observed with increased levels of SUMO2 originates from the effects of SUMO2 on other targets and not on NCAP.",
            "Our data in fact suggest that a general increase in SUMO2 might overcome the NCAP-specific effects. Overexpression of SUMO2 results in the conjugation of SUMO2 to different targets, possibly hundreds, and the global impact of targeting so many other proteins could compensate for the changes occurring only on NCAP.",
            "An important aspect of our work is that NCAP expressed in the hippocampus induced cognitive impairments in the WT mice. These data support our original hypothesis that infection with SARS-CoV-2 might in fact predispose individuals to develop dementia after contracting the virus. Recent epidemiological data further support our conclusions [52]. Another important aspect of our findings is that NCAP worsened the cognitive impairment already present in the JNPL3 mice. This may suggest that patients that are already affected by neurodegenerative diseases could experience a worsening of their conditions after being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and developing COVID-19.",
            "Mechanistically we found that the expression of NCAP in the hippocampus was associated with an increase in Tau phosphorylation. Our findings are in agreement with data published by others [10,53] in brain organoids infected with SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we also found that expression of SUMO2 was accompanied by a reduction in the phosphorylation of Tau. How does SUMO2 affect Tau phosphorylation? It is possible that one or more SUMO2 targets influence Tau phosphorylation. For example, GSK3β, the kinase that phosphorylates Tau on residues 202 and 205, is a target of SUMOylation, and the SUMOylation state of GSK3β is associated with its kinase activity [54]. Thus, it is possible that by altering GSK3β activity, SUMO2 may indirectly alter Tau phosphorylation. SUMO2 could also act directly on Tau. Tau in fact is a target of SUMOylation [55], and SUMOylation of Tau has been reported to modulate its phosphorylation [56]. Therefore, SUMO2 might counteract the NCAP-induced increase in Tau phosphorylation acting on multiple targets.",
            "A limitation of our work is that we utilized recombinant AAVs to induce expression of NCAP directly into the hippocampus instead of infecting the mice with the full SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our approach could potentially induce the presence of much higher levels of NCAP in the brain compared to the amount that could originate from peripheral exposure to the virus. However, our reductionist approach also offers several advantages. For example, we can assess the specific effects caused by the expression of NCAP alone compared with the expression of the whole viral genome; we can also establish the direct effects of NCAP onto Tau expressed in the hippocampus without the confounding effects of inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2, which results in altering the blood–brain barrier, both of which have been previously associated with changes in Tau pathology.",
            "In conclusion, our data demonstrate that NCAP induced pathological changes in the hippocampal neurons of animals expressing wild-type Tau and aggravated the pathology in neurons expressing mutant forms of Tau, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that SUMO2 conjugation ameliorated NCAP-induced Tau pathology and directly reduced NCAP granules in mouse neurons and human iPSC-derived neurons carrying an AD-related mutation in PSEN1.",

            "To quantify NCAP granules, 3–5 images totaling >100 cells per sample were acquired using a 40× objective. The granules were analyzed automatically with the Image J plugin “Particle analysis”. A random selection of images was hand-verified. The NCAP granules average size were analyzed by the Image J software version 1.53C using the ‘analyze particles’ instrument with the threshold “size = 0.00–100.00”.",
            "For the biochemical analysis, the mice were perfused with 20 mL of ice-cold PBS, the brains were dissected to separate the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum, and they were snap-frozen. The hippocampi were homogenized in extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 50 mM KCl, and 10 mM MgCl2) supplemented with complete protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche Applied Science) and N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) at 20 mM. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 7000× g rpm for 10 min.",

Once trained, the mice performed the test that was composed of a total of 3 trials with an inter-trial interval of 30 min. Each mouse was allowed to walk on the rotating bar for up to 300 s per trial with acceleration from 4 up to 40 rpm.

            "COVID-19 is associated with oxidative stress, peripheral hyper inflammation, and neuroinflammation, especially in individuals with a more severe form of the disease. Some studies provide evidence on the onset or exacerbation of major depressive disorder (MDD), among other psychiatric disorders due to COVID-19. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are associated conditions, especially in the more severe form of MDD and in refractoriness to available therapeutic strategies. Inflammatory cytokines in the COVID-19 hyper inflammation process can activate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme. IDO activation can reduce tryptophan and increase toxic metabolites of the kynurenine pathway, which increases glial activation, neuroinflammation, toxicity, and neuronal death. This review surveyed a number of studies and analyzed the mechanisms of oxidative stress, inflammation, and neuroinflammation involved in COVID-19 and depression. Finally, the importance of more protocols that can help elucidate the interaction between these mechanisms underlying COVID-19 and MDD and the possible therapeutic strategies involved in the interaction of these mechanisms are highlighted.",
            "In December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), resulting from infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), made its first appearance in the city of Wuhan, province of Hubei, China, when there were 41 confirmed cases of unknown etiology pneumonia (Zhu et al. 2020; Lu et al. 2020). Later, this new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified as a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to group 2B of the β-coronavirus family (Hui et al. 2020).",
            "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that commonly cause changes in the upper respiratory tract and can less often instigate gastrointestinal and neurological disorders in a wide variety of mammals and birds. These viruses have high mutation and recombination rates and propensity to transmission between different species (Zhu et al. 2020). Two coronaviruses have been transmitted from animals to humans, which induce respiratory disease and death in affected individuals. In 2002 and 2003, SARS-CoV was the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in the province of Guangdong, China (Zhong et al. 2003; Li et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020). In 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified as responsible for outbreaks of severe respiratory diseases in the Middle East (Zaki et al. 2012; Muraduzzaman et al. 2018).",
            "MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), while SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 depend on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter the host cell. SARS-CoV-2 expresses the spike protein (S) associated with greater transmissibility due to its multiple mutations. This protein binds to ACE2, activated by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), thus allowing virus entry to the cell (Ecdc 2020; Ziegler et al. 2020; Deming and Chen 2020). These ACE receptors are expressed in the olfactory mucosa, lung, neuronal, and glial cells in the human CNS (Netland et al. 2008; Lukassen et al. 2020; Brann et al. 2020; Tremblay et al. 2020). In mice, ACE2 can also be observed in the main brain regions involved in blood pressure regulation and body fluid homeostasis, such as in circumventricular organs (CVOs), in the subfornical organ, in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), in the nucleus of the solitary tract (nucleus tractus solitarii, NTS) and in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (Xia and Lazartigues 2010; Nampoothiri et al. 2020). However, despite being highly vascularized, all these regions have little protection from the blood–brain barrier (BBB) (Duvernoy and Risold 2007; Maolood and Meister 2009; Miyata 2015; Bentivoglio et al. 2018). This lack of protection makes these sites vulnerable to circulating pathogens and can be gateways to the brain (Sisó et al. 2010; Bentivoglio et al. 2018). In addition, in an Alzheimer brain, blood–brain barrier fragility is responsible for peripheral inflammation spreading to the brain, leading to cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms (Takeda et al. 2014).",
            "Individuals with COVID-19 usually report changes in the perception of taste and smell, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can also affect cells within the central nervous system (CNS) (Dempsey 2021). In addition, histopathological examination of the brains of deceased patients with COVID-19 indicates its potential for CNS invasion (Solomon et al. 2020). This invasion can occur through the neural-mucosal interface by transmucosal entry via regional nervous structures, exploring structures close to the olfactory mucosa, endothelial and nervous tissue, including delicate olfactory and sensory nerve endings. Furthermore, taste buds and gustatory cells in humans do not present ACE2, turning the direct infection and inflammation unlikely to be the reason for taste loss. In this regard, the likely via of cell damage is stratified squamous epithelial cells and filiform papillae, which present ACE2, being infected and progressing to its vicinity causing gustatory cell infection, inflammation, and damage, leading to gustatory system malfunction (Wang et al. 2020). From this, transport can occur along the olfactory tract of the CNS, generating these changes in the perception of smell and taste (Meinhardt et al. 2021). In this way, it was possible to identify viral particles of SARS-COV-2 in the olfactory nerve, in the straight gyrus, and in the brainstem with signs of profound damage to all tissue elements, including glial cells, neurons, their axons, and myelin in a post-mortem analysis of nervous tissue from a person affected by COVID-19-associated severe respiratory failure (Bulfamante et al. 2020).",
            "Thus, SARS-COV-2 can invade the body through various pathways, thus causing systemic and tissue inflammation. This systemic infection presents a massive increase in pro-inflammatory factors in the circulating blood, described as a cytokine storm (Coperchini et al. 2020). Thus, the virus can cross the BBB, considering that inflammatory cytokines induce its instability (Daniels et al. 2014). Alternatively, as already mentioned, the virus can pass through the circumventricular organs or retrograde axonal transport via the olfactory bulb and ultimately infect the brain (Duvernoy and Risold 2007; Sisó et al. 2010; Dempsey 2021).",
            "In addition to the BBB, astrocytes produce another defense mechanism in the brain, reactive astrogliosis, and respond to stimuli, triggering up-regulation of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and with astroglial hypertrophy. Astrogliosis is activated in the face of injury, promoting changes in gene expression, biochemistry, morphology, and physiology, of an inflammatory nature, in astrocytes to protect the CNS against this pathological lesion (Verkhratsky et al. 2017).",
            "Thus, neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV-2 is possible, providing activation of reactive astrogliosis, triggering increased production and secretion of cytokines and other pro-inflammatory factors, and perpetuating neuroinflammation (Daniels et al. 2017; Matschke et al. 2020). As a result, the combination of systemic inflammation, hypoxia resulting from respiratory failure, and neuroinflammation can trigger or exacerbate psychiatric illness (Taylor et al. 2016; Steardo et al. 2020). Thus, like other viral respiratory infections, SARS-CoV-2 can have multiple neurological and psychiatric consequences (Paniz‐Mondolfi et al. 2020).",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic has been correlated with depression and anxiety (Huang and Zhao 2020) and it has been hypothesized that some mental disorders will be prevalent in patients that survive after COVID-19 (DePierro et al. 2020). In a survey involving more than 3,900 individuals that had already gone through the COVID-19 disease, conducted between May 2020 and January 2021, 52.4% presented the symptoms that could characterize major depressive disorder (MDD). These results warn about the importance of investigating the potential neuropsychiatric outcomes due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Perlis et al. 2021). Some patterns can be perceived, such as prevalence in younger respondents, in men, in patients with more considerable COVID-19 severity, and in those who had headaches during acute infection (Perlis et al. 2021). Moreover, a number of researchers evidenced that smell and taste loss due to SARS-COV-2 infection is associated with greater depressive and anxious symptoms (Speth et al. 2020).",
            "This work is a narrative review. Original articles were searched in scientific literature databases, which published relevant evidence on the involvement of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the potential of this condition for triggering the TDM. In addition to the original works, the authors considered literature reviews to observe the discussions and suggestions in the context of the evolution of the disease’s sequelae and as a way of considering studies not found in the database search strategies.",
            "At least two authors read the cited references. This strategy aimed to confirm the relevance of each study and extract some critical data unnoticed by an author.",
            "Oxidative stress is defined as the imbalance between free radicals and neutralizing molecules. It has as protagonists the oxidizing system, consisting of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which are neutralized by the antioxidant system (Camini et al. 2017). Under physiological conditions, these molecules act on cell signaling, regulating cytokines and growth factors as immunomodulators (Camini et al. 2017) and in the natural aging process (Liguori et al. 2018). However, a high level of these molecules is found in chronic pathologies and viral infections.",
            "Diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cancer, hypertension, and coronary heart disease, among others, have their severity associated with oxidative stress (Yaribeygi et al. 2020). Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 family has been noticed in infections, particularly by RNA viruses (Zhang et al. 2019). COVID-19 seems to have exacerbation of the production of free radicals and a reduction in the antioxidants’ action. Thus, high levels of oxidative markers in patients with COVID-19 are noticed, and oxidative stress may signal the severity of this and other diseases (Ivanov et al. 2016). Thus, the virus can directly act on brain infection, and the release of inflammatory and/or oxidative markers can cause neuroinflammation and tissue damage.",
            "Reactive species, both oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS), have unpaired valence electrons (Ivanov et al. 2016; Bensakhria 2018), turning them into highly unstable molecules that can reach adjacent cells. The ROS consist of hydroxyl radical (OH), superoxide anion (O2-), singlet oxygen (O2), oxygen peroxide (H2O2), and ozone (O3) (Bensakhria 2018). For the RNS, the components are nitric oxide (NO), peroxynitrite (ONOO-), nitrosyl cation (NO +), nitrosyl anion (NO-), and nitrous acid (NH2O2) (Camini et al. 2017; Bensakhria 2018). These free radicals are by-products of natural cellular processes and of the functioning of organelles such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (Zhang et al. 2019).",
            "Under physiological conditions, homeostasis occurs between release of these molecules and their neutralization by antioxidants. However, with the imbalance, the free radicals have access to different cells, causing deleterious effects on all biomolecules (Ivanov et al. 2016; Bensakhria 2018). Thus, the most reactive hydroxyl radical is able to oxidize molecules such as DNA, phospholipids, and proteins, while the superoxide can generate other free radicals, as well as associate with nitric oxide (NO), and form the peroxynitrite radical (ONOO-), a powerful NO depleted oxidant. When converted to hydroxyl, hydrogen peroxide is able to cross membranes, and ozone is a powerful oxidant of lipid chains, as well as it is able to interact with different organic and inorganic substances, in addition to generating other free radicals (Bensakhria 2018).",
            "The damage caused by free radicals is capable of providing feedback to the system and triggering an oxidative storm, affecting the body as a whole. In this scenario, cell membranes are affected by the phenomenon of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and denaturation. DNA damage occurs and can induce inflammatory immune responses, mutations and tumorigenesis risk, as well as induce cells to apoptosis (Zhang et al. 2019). Thus, oxidative stress is present in autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and chronic renal and cardiovascular diseases, in addition to RNA virus infections (Bensakhria 2018; Liguori et al. 2018; Yaribeygi et al. 2020).",
            "The COVID-19 infection recruits macrophages, which produce high rates of inflammatory molecules and NO. In pro-inflammatory situations, this is a self-reinforcing cycle that contributes to oxidative and nitrosative stress, generating an inflammatory state (Alamdari et al. 2020). High levels of free radicals, along with low levels of antioxidants, cause oxidative stress, worsening the COVID-19 patients’ condition (Muhammad et al. 2021). A study of 25 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and 25 control volunteers found increased levels of nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress in patients with COVID-19. These studies also evidenced that antioxidant substances such as methylene blue, vitamin C, and N-Acetyl cysteine induced therapeutic responses, improving the survival rate of critically ill patients (Alamdari et al. 2020).",
            "Patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis in an intensive care unit presented low levels of vitamin C, thiol protein, glutathione, γ-tocopherol, and β-carotene in peripheral blood. Increased copper was also observed when compared to zinc in 55% of the patients. Increased copper has been linked to lipid peroxides. Furthermore, there was an increase in the levels of C-reactive protein and myeloperoxidase. In summary, there was an increase in lipid peroxidation and deficits in some antioxidants (Pincemail et al. 2021). A cross-sectional study of 50 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 conducted in Jigawa, northwestern Nigeria, found low levels of vitamins A, C, and E, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. In addition, the researchers observed low levels of selenium, zinc, magnesium, chromium, and malondialdehyde and high rates of oxidative stress marker 8-isoprostaglandin F2 alpha in the blood of the patients, when compared to the controls (Muhammad et al. 2021).",
            "Based on the scientific literature, it is possible to infer that oxidative stress is a hallmark among the pathophysiological mechanisms of COVID-19.",
            "Inflammation is a response present in evolved organisms, fighting against detrimental stimuli such as tissue damage and microbial infection. Acute inflammation is thought to be the first-line defense, and it is a component of the innate immune system (Ahmed 2011; Zhou et al. 2020a; Arunachalam et al. 2020; Hoagland et al. 2021).",
            "SARS-CoV-2 exerts detrimental effects on neurological functions assessing this complex system through multiple pathways such as the neuronal pathway, blood circulation, and direct infection (Fig. 1) (Wu et al. 2020). The most important ones in this regard are the first and second pathways. In the neuronal pathway, the viruses infect motor or sensory nerve endings, activating neuronal transport mechanisms, which frequently occur in the olfactory fibers due to their singular organization that connects the nasal cavity directly to the central nervous system (CNS) (Koyuncu et al. 2013; Swanson and McGavern 2015). In the bloodstream, it is proposed that the virus can reach the CNS by binding to the ACE2 receptor in the blood–brain barrier (BBB) or by entering in monocytes and macrophages to freely cross the BBB (Zhou et al. 2020b). In addition, although macrophages work as a defense mechanism in a great range of infections, including virus infections, in SARS-CoV-2 infection it enables viral adhesion and anchoring to pulmonary parenquima and allows the virus to enter the organism through ACE2, as well as to replicate in their interior (Uversky et al. 2021).Fig. 1Invasion pathways of SARS-CoV-2, neuroinflammation, and MDD. SARS-CoV-2 can invade the body through various pathways, thus causing systemic inflammation. The virus uses enzyme ACE2 as an entry receptor for cell invasion, resorting to TMPRSS2 to initiate its S protein of ACE2. The ACE2 expression is known in human blood vessel endothelial and microvasculature cells. Thus, invasion by the virus causes systemic inflammation, whose main characteristic is the activation of the cytokine production cascade, called cytokine storm. This systemic inflammation compromises permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), making it unstable. With this, the brain is flooded with pro-inflammatory factors, and the passage is free for SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, which can be through infected leukocytes. This process will activate microglia and astrocytes, which will release more pro-inflammatory factors. From this, neuroinflammation propagates, which is positively associated with MDD. The virus can also reach the CNS through the circumventricular organs, midline structures around the third and fourth ventricles, which the BBB does not protect. Another gateway is through the olfactory epithelium, in which the virus propagates through the olfactory nerve, crossing the cribriform lamina and reaching the olfactory bulb in the CNS. This way is retrograde dissemination, through trans-synaptic transfer, using endocytosis and exocytosis processes of vesicles containing the virus, with subsequent axonal transport to the neuronal cell bodies.

            "Invasion pathways of SARS-CoV-2, neuroinflammation, and MDD. SARS-CoV-2 can invade the body through various pathways, thus causing systemic inflammation. The virus uses enzyme ACE2 as an entry receptor for cell invasion, resorting to TMPRSS2 to initiate its S protein of ACE2. The ACE2 expression is known in human blood vessel endothelial and microvasculature cells. Thus, invasion by the virus causes systemic inflammation, whose main characteristic is the activation of the cytokine production cascade, called cytokine storm.

            "It is known that SARS-CoV-2 induces pro-inflammatory cytokines up-regulation, leading to a cytokine storm (Barnes et al. 2020). Among the pro-inflammatory cytokines induced in SARS-CoV-2 infection, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, interferon-γ (IFNγ), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stand out (Beltrán-García et al. 2020). The innate immune cells are activated in COVID-19, and the mast cells play an important role in this regard, releasing histamine, cytokines, and chemokines, raising the inflammatory reactions, which makes mast activation a major contributor to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (Kempuraj et al. 2016, 2017, 2020). Furthermore, coagulation disorders, present in COVID-19 patients, increase neuroinflammation, stroke, and cognitive decline risks (Pezzini and Padovani 2020). In addition, glial cells play a major role in neuroinflammation. In physiological conditions, the glia is able to modulate neuronal environment leading to homeostasis, and, in pathological conditions, it can induce neuroinflammation. The microglia function as resident macrophages in the CNS depending on the phagocytic activity, mediated by triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) (Gogoleva et al. 2019). Therefore, after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immune system is up-regulated, promoting many different molecules that can act in the CNS by different pathways. The presence of a virus in the CNS associated with the pro-inflammatory response leads to inflammation in the neuronal tissue, which is thought to be one of the relevant mechanisms causing neural alterations in COVID-19 patients (Kempuraj et al. 2020).",
            "Some people present cognitive impairment after being diagnosed with COVID-19. One hypothesis for this change is related to neuroinflammation markers and to microvascular lesions involved in Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 may have biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (Zhou et al. 2021).",
            "Peripheral infection can inflame BBB cells, such as those in the choroid plexus, thus transmitting inflammation to the brain parenchyma. In this study, the authors observed increased microglial activation genes associated with COVID-19 and suggested that activated microglia emerge from increased inflammation in the CNS. Microglial subgroups in the cerebral cortex after COVID-19 death were also evidenced. These characteristics are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, this study suggests that acute viral infection can cause lasting neuroinflammation, predisposing individuals to neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric diseases (Yang et al. 2021).",
            "In a cohort study, researchers evidenced seven variants of the gene for IL-6 and five variants of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) in the peripheral blood of a general population, which appear to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases and in COVID-19 severity, with neuroinflammation as a frequent cause. The authors suggest extensive investigation of the pleiotropic function of IL-6 as a therapeutic target for severe cases or with the possibility of increased COVID-19 severity and implications for the CNS (Strafella et al. 2020).",
            "Severe cases of COVID-19 have shown hyper inflammation caused by a cytokine storm (Mehta et al. 2020). However, new analyses have led to a possible oxidative storm due to high lipid peroxidation and oxidation of membrane proteins. These deleterious effects can contribute to a transformation and hyalinization of the pulmonary alveolar membranes (Xu et al. 2020), accelerating the process of tissue stiffness and causing lethal respiratory distress. Thus, the risk factor for groups such as older adults and people with diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases is understood, as these individuals already have a state of oxidative stress (Liguori et al. 2018; Yaribeygi et al. 2020).",
            "A chronic low level of oxidative stress and inflammation, added to the changes caused by a viral infection, seems to be responsible for the most severe forms of COVID-19 (Zhou et al. 2020a, b, c), as they cause viruses to induce high production of free radicals and depletion of antioxidants (Camini et al. 2017). The increase in ROS may occur due to a mitochondrial dysfunction caused by penetration of the virus into the cell or by signaling exacerbated by the “cytokine storm” with release of Il-2, Il-6, Il-7, and TNF-α (Mehta et al. 2020). Similarly, immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils play a potential pathological role (Merad and Martin 2020) by producing and secreting high pro-inflammatory cytokines and ROS levels. This uncontrolled production increases oxidative stress, and hyper inflammation can affect the immune system, altering immune cell function and the inflammatory response (Galley 2011; Nagar et al. 2018).",
            "A number of studies indicate the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in the activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (Dikalov and Nazarewicz 2013; Rincón et al. 2015) by binding to the angiotensin I receptor (AT1R) (Valente et al. 2012) and, thus, in ROS release. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) participates in the binding of the virus to the human cell and allows viral entry into the cell membrane. Thus, with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is a reduction in the ACE2 bioavailability and an increase in the interaction between angiotensin and the production of free radicals. The entry of the virus itself and the viral load can modulate oxidative stress and the inflammatory response, both processes that directly contribute to COVID-19 severity (Fig. 2) (OUDIT et al. 2007; Sawalha et al. 2020).Fig. 2SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and oxidative stress. SARS-CoV-2 can modulate oxidative stress and the inflammatory response, both processes that directly contribute to COVID-19 severity. Coming from the liver, angiotensinogen is cleaved by renin, and released by the kidneys to angiotensin I (Ang I), which is then converted to angiotensin II (Ang II) through the action of ACE. Ang II is a potent vasoconstrictor, which uses the AT1 receptor to signal the NF-κB transcription factor, which results in the activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX), an essential source of ROS production. Ang II will be converted to angiotensin (1–7) through ACE2. However, SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 for cell invasion, promoting a decrease in the expression of this enzyme and suppressing its proteolytic activity. With this enzyme’s local or systemic depletion, there is an increase in the level of Ang II and, consequently, a more significant induction of ROS production via NOX in endothelial cells, triggering mitochondrial oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. The images were extracted from the BioRender app",

            "Hyper inflammation is triggered by the cytokines and can be accompanied by cytopenia and hyperferritinemia (Camini et al. 2017; Bensakhria 2018). ROS production occurs by Fenton reaction (Fe(II) + H2O2 → Fe(III) + HO‾ + HO‾) (Ivanov et al. 2016). This mechanism occurs through the attack of SARS-CoV-2 on the hemoglobin (Hb) groups of red blood cells, concentrating Fe(III) ions in the bloodstream (Chen et al. 2020) which in turn produces an increase in the ferritin levels (Zhou et al. 2020a, b, c). Thus, hemoglobinopathy and iron dysmetabolism caused by the infection culminates in oxidative stress, ferroptosis, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial damage, among others (Cavezzi et al. 2020).",
            "Cytokines stimulate nitric oxide synthase (NOs) isoforms and, consequently, the production of nitric oxide (NO), which can react with the superoxide ion and generate the potent oxidizing peroxynitrite radical (ONOO-) (Camini et al. 2017). In this scenario, as juveniles are exposed to physical, chemical, and biological factors, tissue ischemia may neutralize the cofactors of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and NADPH oxidase myeloperoxidase, preventing return to the body homeostasis (Camini et al. 2017; Bensakhria 2018).",
            "The HPA axis is a neuroendocrine component that integrates the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands, working through a complex positive and negative feedback system depending on hormones and receptors in these three organs, modulating multiple physiological and pathological processes. The HPA axis function starts at the hypothalamus that releases the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) that will up-regulate the pituitary gland to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), releasing it into the bloodstream. ACTH will induce the adrenal gland to synthesize glucocorticoids as cortisol (DeMorrow 2018).",
            "COVID-19 is considered a systemic disease, as it affects organs in the entire body (Guan et al. 2020; Gavriatopoulou et al. 2020). The ACE2 enzyme is expressed in many places, such as venous and arterial endothelial cells, which irrigate and drain the adrenal glands (Pal 2020). Some studies have observed that ACE2 is related to a reduction in the HPA axis activity and that it is involved in beneficial effects on stress-related behavioral changes (Wang et al. 2018).",
            "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), considered remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2, is one of the primary immune invasive strategies to deregulate the cortisol response to the antigen. It does so through the expression of amino acid sequences that mimetize parts of the ACTH sequence. Therefore, immune system strategies to fight against the infection would accidentally destroy ACTH, consequently causing an alteration in the cortisol dynamics in COVID-19 patients (Pal 2020).",
            "SARS viruses are linked with hypothalamus and pituitary gland alterations. There is evidence that 40% of the 63 patients that went through SARS infection had central adrenal insufficiency for some time. The presence of hypothyroidism and low rates of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate suggests hypothalamus-pituitary damage (Leow et al. 2005; Al-Aridi et al. 2011; Mocking et al. 2015; Zhu et al. 2015; Alzahrani et al. 2021). There are two main hypotheses by which the hypothalamus-pituitary axis could interact with ACE2: the first one is through blood, and the cribriform plate directs the second one. In that regard, autopsy studies have shown SARS-CoV samples and neuronal degeneration in the hypothalamus (Pal 2020).",
            "It is important to mention that COVID-19 patients with more severe diseases had reduced ACTH and cortisol rates (Alzahrani et al. 2021). Despite the similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, more studies about the clinical manifestations in HPA caused by the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic are necessary.",
            "An online survey noted an increase in some psychiatric disorders due to the pandemic and an even more significant increase in suicidal ideation in people who had experienced COVID-19 and presented positive screening for MDD and generalized anxiety disorder (Tsai et al. 2021). The patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who required hospitalization, were assessed using questionnaires about post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, trauma exposure, resilience, and perceived social support. A total of 898 patients were evaluated, of which 13.2% had post-traumatic stress disorder, 21.0% suffered from depression, and 16.4% presented MDD (Chen et al. 2021).",
            "Major depressive disorder (MDD) has a multifactorial etiology and is related to high oxidative stress and neuroinflammation levels. MDD severity can be associated with high levels of circulating cytokines (Reichenberg et al. 2001; Harrison et al. 2009; Grigoleit et al. 2011; Köhler et al. 2017; Kageyama et al. 2018; Zou et al. 2018). Early life stress and chronic stress in adult life are highly contributing situations to the deterioration of the patient’s clinical condition. The MDD pathophysiology and periods of chronic stress involve an exacerbated and uncontrolled increase in the body’s immune response, causing increased inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12. Presence of these cytokines in high levels was associated with increased numbers of non-classical monocytes (Ellul et al. 2016; Kim and Won 2017; Ignácio et al. 2017; Nowak et al. 2019; Peng et al. 2021; Gumpp et al. 2021; Tuon et al. 2021). Both oxidative stress and neuroinflammation cause damage to brain tissue (Ignácio et al. 2017).",
            "The kynurenine pathway is linked to inflammation in MDD through the action of kynurenines, metabolites of the kynurenine pathway that present neurotoxicity when released in an exacerbated manner, in addition to reducing serotonin synthesis. This neurotransmitter has reduced levels in cases of MDD. Some metabolites of the kynurenine pathway have pro-inflammatory functions, such as quinolinic acid (QA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and 3-hydroxy-anthranilic acid (3-HAA) (Kubacka et al. 2020; Tuka et al. 2021). With the prolonged release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, there is inhibition of the function of glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus and an increase in reactive oxygen species, generating a vicious cycle highly linked to MDD and COVID-19 (Kim et al. 2016; Di Nicola et al. 2020). In this sense, some studies suggest that the cytokine storm that is present, especially in more severe COVID-19 patients, may activate the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1) enzyme and, consequently, culminate in a drastic reduction of tryptophan, increases in toxic metabolites of the kynurenine pathway, and depression (Bouças et al. 2020).",
            "COVID-19 can trigger a storm of cytokines that involve the same substances present in neuroinflammation in cases of MDD, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. In addition, infection by SARS-CoV-2 stimulates the innate immune system to release mast cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells, among others (Kempuraj et al. 2020). SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to exert an action of exacerbating depressive symptoms or even stimulating development of the disorder (Grolli et al. 2021).",
            "A prospective, observational, and cross-sectional clinical study conducted between April and August 2020 with one hundred and twenty-seven patients separated the volunteers into three categories, which were patients diagnosed with mild, moderate, or severe forms of COVID-19. The patients with the severe form of the disease had higher rates of superoxide anion radicals and lower rates of nitric oxide when compared to the other groups. Furthermore, catalase was increased in the moderate group when compared to the group that presented the severe form of the disease (Cekerevac et al. 2021).",
            "SARS-CoV presents angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its functional cell invasion receptor (Li et al. 2003). Through its spike protein (S) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) action, a serine protease, SARS-CoV-2 couples to the ACE2 receptor to promote its entry into cells (Hoffmann et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2021). Given the presence of ACE2 receptors in microglia and astrocytes, it may be possible to relate SARS-CoV-2 with glial activation (Tremblay et al. 2020). In fact, some studies have shown microglial and astrocytic activation in the CNS of COVID-19 patients who had more severe conditions and encephalopathies (Pilotto and Padovani 2020; Matschke et al. 2020; Meinhardt et al. 2021). On the other hand, the virus seems to predominantly infect immune and vascular cells, thus causing a local inflammation that up-regulates astrocytes and microglia, potentiating the effects of circulating systemic cytokines in the severe form of the disease (Solomon et al. 2020). An in vitro research study evaluated the Spike protein, a product of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that releases exosomes with microRNAs. These mRNAs are internalized by microglia and hyperactivate the expression of genes related to the expression of pro-inflammatory substances, such as TNFa, NF-kB, and IFN-b, triggering neuroinflammation (Mishra and Banerjea 2020).",
            "In addition to this direct activation, human coronaviruses infect peripheral myeloid cells, which can be recruited to transmigrate to the CNS under conditions of inflammation or psychological stress in situations where there is an increase in the permeability of the BBB. In the CNS, neuroinflammation is propagated through infected monocytes, which promote the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-2R, and TNF-α, and stimulation of microglia, contributing to neuropsychiatric symptoms resulting from COVID-19 (Fig. 3) (Wohleb et al. 2015; Hong and Banks 2015; Desforges et al. 2019; Troyer et al. 2020).Fig. 3COVID-19 and glial activation by the kynurenine pathway — MDD route. SARS-CoV-2 induces a cytokine storm. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as INF-α, TNF-α, IFN-y, and IL-6 stimulate the action of IDO, which, together with TDO, is responsible for converting tryptophan into kynurenine. Proportionally, with the increased action of IDO, there is an increase in the conversion of available tryptophan into kynurenine. With that, there is greater kynurenine pathway activity and lower tryptophan bioavailability for the serotonin pathway. Another action of pro-inflammatory cytokines is to increase the action of enzymes in the QA transformation chain in the microglia. KMO, KYNU, and 3-HAO have their activities increased, thus promoting greater conversion of KYN into its end product: QA. This neurotoxic metabolite can positively affect ROS production, promoting oxidative stress. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress result in brain damage and in major depressive disorder (MDD).

            "In a postmortem study with patients who died due to COVID-19, the researchers evidenced infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and astrogliosis in the brain tissues, being more pronounced in the brainstem and cerebellum (Matschke et al. 2020). Other postmortem surveys of three COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms showed that the cerebral cortex had increased numbers of reactive astrocytes and exacerbated microglial activation, as well as decreased glutathione levels and up-regulation of genes related to IL-1B, IL-6, interferon-inducible transmembrane, MX dynamin-like GTPase 1, and 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 2, suggesting a relationship between oxidative stress and neuroinflammation mediated by glia (Boroujeni et al. 2021). Another research study observed that microglial activation in the postmortem brainstem was exacerbated. In addition, there was an increase in innate immunity with microglial activation (Poloni et al. 2021). Plasma concentration of the astrogliosis marker, GFAP, was also increased in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (Kanberg et al. 2020).",
            "Glial cells are critical regulators of CNS homeostasis under physiological conditions. These cells also express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). IDO is positively stimulated by cytokines and is closely related to the kynurenine pathway, already associated with the development of MDD. Briefly, IDO, originating from brain cells and from the immune system, together with tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), from the liver, is responsible for converting tryptophan, an essential amino acid precursor of serotonin, into kynurenine. With the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-α, TNF-α, INF-y, and IL-6, there is super stimulation of the action of IDO, which promotes an increase in the conversion of available tryptophan into kynurenine, thus causing greater activity of the kynurenine pathway and lower tryptophan bioavailability for the serotonin synthesis pathway (Raison et al. 2010; Ogawa et al. 2014; Anderson et al. 2016; Dell’Osso et al. 2016; Doolin et al. 2018).",
            "Changes in tryptophan metabolism within the kynurenine pathway were correlated with increased IL-6 in COVID-19 patients (Thomas et al. 2020). Other researchers provide evidence for an increased rate of kynurenine relative to tryptophan in serum from COVID-19 patients and suggest that these results reflect the increased inflammation level in infected patients (Lionetto et al. 2021).",
            "In the kynurenine pathway, an action of pro-inflammatory cytokines in microglia is to increase the action of the enzymes that participate in the pathway of quinolinic acid (QA), a neurotoxic metabolite. Among the effects of QA are reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, BBB disruption, cell cytoskeleton destabilization, promotion of tau phosphorylation, impairment in autophagy processes, and MDD (Guillemin et al. 2003; Ganzella et al. 2006; Braidy et al. 2009; La Cruz et al. 2012; Pierozan et al. 2018; da Silveira et al. 2018; Ferreira et al. 2018).",
            "The enzymes associated with the QA chain, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), kynureninase (KYNU), and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase (3-HAO) have their activities increased in the microglia due to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, there is greater conversion of kynurenine (KYN) into its final product, QA, increasing the production of this neurotoxic metabolite and, indirectly, decreasing KYN bioavailability for the production of the neuroprotective metabolite, kynurenic acid (KynA) (Heisler and O’Connor 2015). To corroborate, patients who had attempted suicide had increased levels of QA in the cerebrospinal fluid (Steiner et al. 2011; Erhardt et al. 2013; Schwieler et al. 2020).",
            "COVID-19 patients had higher levels of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms when compared to the control group. In this study, it was observed that the levels of peripheral blood C-reactive protein (CRP), the peripheral inflammatory indicator, were positively related to the severity of depression (Guo et al. 2020). Another study tracked psychiatric symptoms in 402 adult individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 for 1 month after hospital treatment. Overall, 56% of these individuals have scored in the pathological range of at least one psychiatric dimension. Of the 402 individuals, 42% fell into the psychopathological range for anxiety, 40% for insomnia, 31% for depression, 28% for PTSD, and 20% for obsessive–compulsive (OC) symptoms. Within these groups, female individuals stood out in the anxiety and depression results. In addition, individuals who already had a previous psychiatric history obtained high scores on most of the psychopathological measures. Another relationship that can be observed was the depression and anxiety scores positively associated with the baseline systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), which is based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts to reflect the immune response to the systemic inflammation generated (Mazza et al. 2020).",
            "Since the first research study on COVID-19 symptoms and pathophysiology, challenges have been pointed out, considering the possibility of virus entry into the CNS or of neurophysiological changes from peripheral inflammation, among other systemic conditions developed in SARS-CoV-2 infection (Ng Kee Kwong et al. 2020; Kotfis et al. 2020). Considering the conditions imposed on the CNS due to neuroinflammation, even mild in children and adolescents, some authors even argue about possible future damage and neuropsychiatric conditions (Serrano-Castro et al. 2020).",
            "The cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 can damage the BBB, leading to triggering or exacerbation of neuroinflammation, a condition present in MDD, among other psychiatric disorders and various CNS diseases (Kempuraj et al. 2020).",
            "A close association between individuals who were affected by COVID-19 and the presentation of psychiatric signs and symptoms can be considered. This relationship is emerging and still needs many studies, especially considering the number of people affected by the virus during the pandemic and which may result in mental illness. Thus, longitudinal monitoring of patients after COVID-19 should be proposed, paying attention to the neuroimmune status and signs and symptoms of psychiatric disorders. This follow-up should encompass the different moments throughout the life course of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2. It will be possible to verify and evaluate the course of the remaining mental and behavioral impacts of COVID-19 on the affected population (Troyer et al. 2020).",
            "It is crucial to highlight post-mortem studies, which observed infiltration of inflammatory markers, increased oxidative stress, and increased astrocytic reactivity, astrogliosis, and microglial activation in the brain tissues of individuals who died after COVID-19-related complications (Kanberg et al. 2020; Boroujeni et al. 2021). Thus, despite the lack of studies relating oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and depression, diverse evidence suggests that these pathophysiological mechanisms emerge from COVID-19 and are potent intertwined factors, both in MDD induction and exacerbation.",
            "Another important mechanism related to hyper inflammation and glial activation is related to the neurotoxic metabolites of the kynurenine pathway. Greater activation of the kynurenine pathway in COVID-19 has already been shown. The shift of tryptophan metabolism towards the kynurenine pathway is also related to increased oxidative stress and is a relevant mechanism involved in MDD. Thus, the toxic function of kynurenine pathway metabolites from SARS-CoV-2-induced hyper inflammation is another potential mechanism that involves oxidative stress and triggers or exacerbates MDD.",
            "Research on the symptoms and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in COVID-19 provides strong evidence for oxidative stress, hyper inflammation, and brain alterations underlying glial activation and neuroinflammation from COVID-19 in triggering and exacerbating MDD. Based on this evidence, it is possible to point out the importance of studies that can relate the interaction of these mechanisms in survivors of COVID-19 survivors in order to elucidate the involvement of the disease in MDD and provide suggestions on new studies that can advance the discovery of more effective therapies to for MDD.",

            "Various neurological manifestations of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported, associated with a broad spectrum of diverse neurological symptoms and syndromes. Estimating rate and relevance of these manifestations remains difficult as there is a lack of standardised case definitions.",
            "We defined comprehensive categories including most reported neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 to allow for a more standardised data collection. After a literature search of MEDLINE with ten keywords, 12 selected studies and larger case series were included. We compared the rate and relevance of neurological manifestations in hospitalized patients. We propose four main categories including 1) cerebrovascular disease, 2) inflammatory syndromes of the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (PNS) and muscle, 3) metabolic/toxic dysfunction of CNS, PNS and muscle and 4) miscellaneous disorders.",
            "Ageusia (702) and anosmia (805) have been reported as the most common and the first occurring neurological symptoms. Cerebrovascular disease (451) and encephalopathy (663) were associated with a more severe course and worse clinical outcome. Any neurological manifestation was associated with a longer hospital stay and a higher morbidity and mortality compared to patients without neurological manifestations. We suggest reporting future neurological manifestations of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) following a pathophysiology-based approach using standardized pre-defined case definitions to yield more specific and comparable data.",
            "The crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2 has kept the world in suspense since its outbreak in Wuhan, China in 2019. What started as an epidemic was soon declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the 11th of March 2020 [35, 36]. At the time of writing, 3.3 million COVID-19 deaths have been reported by the WHO and over 160 million cumulative cases globally since the start of the pandemic. Although respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 accounts for most of the severe courses and hospital admissions there has been emerging evidence on neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2. These neurological complications are of clinical relevance as they number among the first presenting symptoms and are associated with a more disease course.",
            "In this narrative review we summarise the data on the distribution of neurological manifestations in hospitalized patients, associated with SARS-CoV-2 described in selected literature. We report the rate and relevance of neurological syndromes associated with the virus and suggest a pathophysiology-based approach for the future collection of data on neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2.",
            "SARS-COV-2 is part of the corona virus family comprising seven different virus types that are known to infect humans. It is a large enveloped positive strand-RNA virus with spike proteins on its surface appearing like a solar corona. These surface proteins are used to bind to the human angiotensin-converting-enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) on human cells and the virus uses the transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2) to prime the spike proteins. Therefore, the presence of ACE2 on human cells determines viral cellular tropism. ACE2 is not only expressed in the lung parenchyma, kidney, pancreas, small intestine, testicles and vascular epithelia, but also in the CNS, including neurons and glial cells [37].",
            "Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily presents with respiratory features, several neurological manifestations have been described. This has initiated research on neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and resulted in evidence of its capability to infect nerve cells, adding it to a list of neuro-invasive coronaviruses. There are different routes via which SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to infiltrate the CNS including the olfactory route, the trans-synaptic route, the leukocytic route and the haematogenic route (summarised in Fig. 1). Other suspected routes of invasion also include the route via infection of the gastrointestinal tract as well as the vagus nerve [32]. Employing the first route described, the virus may spread directly via the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate into the CNS, showing close clinical correlation given the anosmia seen as an early symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The second route starts with an infection of peripheral nerves with resultant retrograde axonal transport of virus particles into the CNS. In the third route, virus particles travel to the CNS via the migration of infected leukocytes across the blood brain barrier (BBB). The fourth route is assumed to contain infection of and consequently the transport across vascular endothelium [26, 37].\nFig. 1Mechanisms of Neuroinvasion (Created with BioRender.com)",
            "Mechanisms of Neuroinvasion (Created with BioRender.com)",
            "SARS-CoV-2 is thought to affect the nervous system in different ways including direct and indirect neuropathological effects. These include direct damaging of the CNS, PNS and muscle tissue, indirect vascular effects, para-infectious autoimmune effects (cytokine storm) and post-infectious autoimmune effects (cellular immunity and autoantibodies) illustrated in Fig. 2 [3]. Panciani et al. postulate three phases of infection divided into neuroinvasion, CNS clearance and immune response. According to this pre-clinical model, the virus reaches the CNS via the haematogenous or olfactory route. Viral load is subsequently expected to rise within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as viral replication takes place. During the phase of CNS clearance, viral load within the CSF is expected to decrease while the virus could be detected in the brainstem affecting the respiratory drive. In a post-mortem case series neuroinflammatory changes of the brainstem were one of the most common autopsy findings, with viral particles found within the medulla oblongata affecting the respiratory centre as well as cranial nerves emerging from the brainstem [17]. Finally, immuno-modulatory mechanisms trigger the production of antibodies against glial cells and neurons resulting in para- and post-infectious phenomena. In this phase the reciprocal interaction between the respiratory system and the CNS leads to neurotoxic hypoxia, worsening respiratory failure and subsequent hypoxic brain damage. Nevertheless this remains a pre-clinical model illustrating a possible path of pathogenesis to simplify the understanding of several possible mechanisms [20].\nFig. 2Neuropathological mechanisms (Created with BioRender.com)",
            "Neuropathological mechanisms (Created with BioRender.com)",
            "PNS and muscle can both be affected by direct invasion or systemic immune response. ACE2 is expressed in muscle tissue which presents one possible route of invasion. Peripheral nerves are directly affected and it is postulated that SARS-CoV-2 infection of nervous tissue induces downregulation of ACE2 leading to the overreaction of the Renin-Angiotensin-pathway resulting in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and vasodilation [1]. Systemic immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in PNS involvement by systemic hyperinflammation, macrophagic activation syndrome or also known as cytokine storm [18].",
            "While numerous reports and reviews of neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged to date, the comparability of data across study groups, institutions, and countries remains difficult as different reporting standards are used. Case definitions of neurological manifestations sometimes use a pathophysiology-based approach and at other times use a symptom-based approach, often mixing both approaches. Systematic, standardized case definitions as well as uniform diagnostic criteria of SARS-CoV-2 infections in general and nervous system infection/affection are lacking. Accordingly, overlaps, redundancies, and uncertainties as to which symptom is caused by what type of affection impedes the systemic evaluation of published reports. Without uniform and pre-defined case definitions, the prevalence, incidence, severity, and impact of neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 remain challenging to ascertain. This complicates the development of diagnostic criteria, treatment guidelines and prognostication of neurological affection by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "To define neurological manifestations of COVID-19 requires the use of a standardized definition of the clinical association between neurological disease and SARS-CoV-2. The WHO has provided COVID-19 case definitions for confirmed, probable and suspected cases [35, 36]. These have been applied to neurological manifestations such as SARS-CoV-2 associated meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and stroke by Ellul et al. [3]. Using these definitions across countries would increase the validity of data and could make the difference between a non-specific and specific association compensating for a lack of diagnostic evidence to exclude other causes.",
            "In the following we propose definitions for conditions included in the main categories.",
            "Cerebrovascular disease is defined as a neurologic symptom or syndrome caused by cerebral ischaemia or haemorrhage with a sudden onset of a focal neurological deficit [9].",
            "Encephalopathy describes global brain dysfunction with different underlying pathologies such as metabolic, hypoxic-ischaemic, or septic pathogenesis. No uniform definition exists, and it is not accounted for in formal diagnostic manuals. This issue was addressed by a multi-society consensus paper generating a new recommendation on nomenclature. They define acute encephalopathy as a rapidly (in less than 4 weeks) developing pathobiological brain process expressed clinically as either subsyndromal delirium, delirium, or coma with other possible features such as seizures or extrapyramidal signs. By definition, other terms used to describe encephalopathy such as altered mental state, acute confusional state, acute brain dysfunction and acute brain failure should not be used interchangeably [27].",
            "For delirium we suggest using the five diagnostic criteria as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. These define delirium as a disturbance in attention that develops over a short period of time with a disturbance in cognition both not better explained by a pre-existing condition. There should also be evidence from the past medical history that the disturbance is a direct physiological consequence of a medical condition [2].",
            "Coma is defined as a state of complete unwakefulness graded using diagnostic systems such as the Glasgow Coma Score [27].",
            "Hypoxic ischaemic brain injury is used to describe diffuse brain injury because of transient anoxia or hypoxia [5].",
            "For CNS and PNS inflammatory syndromes (Encephalitis, ADEM, Myelitis and GBS) we suggest using the definitions used by Ellul et a. They define SARS-CoV-2 meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, or CNS vasculitis as SARS-CoV-2 detected in CSF or brain tissue or evidence of SARS-CoV-2-specific intrathecal antibody and no other explanatory pathogen or cause found. Furthermore, ADEM, GBS and other acute neuropathies associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are defined as neurological disease onset within 6 weeks of acute infection; and either SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in any sample or antibody evidence of acute SAR S-CoV-2 infection and no evidence of other commonly associated causes [3].",
            "We defined four categories that included the main neurological complications associated with COVID-19 so far. In the next step we conducted a literature search in order to extrapolate data for our new system of categorisation.",
            "In an attempt to comprehensively appreciate reported observations while trying to reduce –not eliminate – redundancies, the following categories were defined; 1) cerebrovascular disease, 2) inflammatory syndromes of CNS, PNS and muscle, 3) metabolic/toxic dysfunction of CNS, PNS and muscle and 4) miscellaneous disorders. Both reported manifestations as well as symptoms and syndromes were assigned a category. If no assignment was possible the manifestation was grouped under miscellaneous disorders. Thereafter, a search was limited to English language manuscripts and to studies and case series with n > 30. The literature search was started in December 2020 using the following keywords: neurological, neurologic, nervous system, brain, manifestations, complications, peripheral nervous system, central nervous system, COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2.",
            "After scanning the abstracts for syndrome categories of neurologic manifestations we developed a table to group the different neurological manifestations using a pathology-based approach. We assessed the rate of neurologic manifestations in relation to the total rate of COVID-19 cases in the respective publication, if reported. Neurologic manifestations such as altered mental state were grouped under encephalitis or encephalopathy depending on the underlying cause. One prospective case series from Singapore described the additional category of autonomic nervous system dysfunction. As this has only been scarcely described in present literature it was not included as a separate category [14].",
            "Cases were excluded if the manifestations were too unspecific such as ‘other peripheral disorders’, ‘headache’, ‘dizziness’ and ‘syncope’. We report the rate of neurological manifestations as percentage per total SARS-CoV-2 infections if recorded and the rate of neurologic manifestations per category as shown in Table 1. We describe the relevance in association with morbidity, mortality and prolonged hospital stay. As not all studies reported treatment effects or follow-up findings, data on outcome were expected to be incomplete and non- exhaustive.\nTable 1Overview of neurologic manifestations in COVID-19 from identified reports1.

            "The literature search yielded 12 full text articles in English literature describing neurological manifestations and complications of SARS-CoV-2 including a rapid review (901 patients), retrospective as well as prospective observational case series (13,414 patients), cohort studies (137 patients) and surveillance studies (153 patients).",
            "All case series that were included identified a SARS-CoV-2 infection by a positive reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rt-PCR) of SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal swab. Additionally, some case series chose to utilize the WHO criteria for confirmed, suspected and probable cases. The infection severity of the SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia was graded using clinical scores such as the American Thoracic Society score for community-acquired-pneumonia. Stroke severity was sometimes assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and the degree of disability by using the Modified Rankin Scale. The Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit was most often used to monitor delirium. Most studies reported clinical neurological, laboratory and radiological findings and, if examined, CSF analysis. Most also reported treatment approach of neurological manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 and, if recorded at the time, patient outcome at discharge (Fig. 3).\nFig. 3Rate of neurologic manifestations in COVID-19 (4075 in total)",
            "Rate of neurologic manifestations in COVID-19 (4075 in total)",
            "Our literature search identified 12 studies reporting categorizable neurologic manifestations in patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. The overall rate of neurologic manifestations differed massively between studies. While four studies (Ellul et al., Paterson et al., Varatharaj et al. and Meppiel et al) did not compare the rate of neurologic manifestations in COVID-19 patients to those without neurologic manifestations, the remaining eight studies reported a rate ranging from 0.08% [14] to 90% [11]. Nearly all studies found more than one neurological symptom per patient, hence not all numbers add up to 100 %. Figure one displays the distribution of cases according to main categories of neurological manifestations. The most frequent neurologic manifestation reported was miscellaneous disorders with 1676 cases, mostly owing to the high frequency of anosmia and ageusia, followed by metabolic/toxic CNS dysfunction with 1106 cases and cerebrovascular disease being the third most common manifestation with 451 cases. The least common manifestation was CNS inflammation/infection with 67 cases. Table 1 shows the distribution between the main categories. Anosmia (805/1577 (51,05%)) and ageusia (702/1577 (44,51%)) were by far the most reported unspecific symptoms in the category of miscellaneous disorders. Encephalopathy (663/1106 (59,95%)) was reported most within the group of toxic/metabolic CNS dysfunction while neuropathy (50/74 (67,57%)) was most common within the group of toxic/metabolic PNS dysfunction. Within the category of cerebrovascular syndromes, acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) was the most common diagnosis (351/451 (77.83%)). Myalgia was the most frequent symptom within the category of muscle inflammation/infection (251/378 (66,40%) as well as toxic/metabolic muscle dysfunction (160/253 (63,24%)). Within the group of PNS inflammatory syndromes, GBS was the most frequent diagnosis (65/70 (92,29%)). For inflammatory CNS syndromes, encephalitis was the most frequent diagnosis (46/67 (68,66%)).",
            "COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations had a higher disease severity and a worse prognosis. In a retrospective observational case study, any neurological symptom was associated with longer hospital stay (8 days versus 5 days). Encephalopathy and stroke were associated with more severe disease, based on the need for mechanical ventilation (7 cases overall, 5 had more severe disease, p: 0,022) [15]. Meppiel et al. report that COVID-19 severity was particularly severe or critical in the 102 patients (45.2%) with neurological manifestations [19].",
            "This could be due to pre-existing morbidity as Frontera et al. describe that patients with neurologic disorders were older, male, white, hypertensive, diabetic, intubated and had higher sequential organ failure assessment scores (p < 0.05). Even after adjusting for confounders, COVID-19 patients with neurologic disorders had an increased risk of in hospital mortality (HR 1.38 95% CI 1,17-1,62) and a decreased likelihood of discharge home (HR 0,72, 95% CI 0,63-0,85, p < 0.001) [8]. These results are in keeping with Liotta et al. who report a 38% increased risk of in-hospital death and a 28% reduced likelihood of discharge home after adjusting for other factors [15]. In contrast, factors associated with a favourable outcome were younger age, female sex, absence of pre-existing neurological disorders and absence of severe COVID-19 disease [15]. However, within the group of neurological manifestations, anosmia and ageusia have been associated with a better prognosis, being inversely related to death in COVID-19 patients in an international cohort study [22].",
            "Certain case studies reported a significant association between CVD and abnormal coagulation parameters with raised D-dimers, fibrinogen, and prolonged Partial Thromboplastin Time in combination with thrombocytopenia [3, 14, 21, 23, 24]. Treatment approaches included single or dual antiplatelet therapy, prophylactic as well as therapeutic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), new oral anticoagulants, thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy and external ventricular drain placement [3, 5, 14, 21].",
            "Inflammatory CNS syndromes were rarely reported. For encephalitis, the diagnosis was either based on pathology or clinical presentation. Several pre-existing diagnostic criteria were used such as encephalitis defined by clinical consensus criteria [10, 28], criteria of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Academy of Neurology guidelines [25, 29–31, 34]. Other studies used individual definitions such as ‘encephalopathy with evidence of inflammation in the CNS (CSF white cell count >5cells, protein >0.45 g/dl or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) consistent with inflammation)’ [33], ‘altered mental status lasting >24h plus one of the following criteria: white blood count (WBC) in CSF >5/mm3, presence of compatible acute lesion on brain MRI, rt-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF’ [19]. Ellul et al. used the WHO case definition of SARS-CoV-2 associated meningitis, encephalitis and myelitis [35, 36]. To exclude other causative pathogens, some studies tested serum for Herpes-Simplex-Virus 1, Varizella Zoster IgM antibodies, Hepatitis A, B and C and Human-Immunodeficiency-Virus 1 and 2 and syphilis. CSF was tested for anti-neuronal antibodies (N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptor, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, aquaporin-4, leucine-rich glioma inactivated-1, glutamic acid decarboxylase) in some studies and bacterial cultures of the blood and CSF were also tested and found negative [3, 21]. In the case study by Meppiel et al. 2/21 cases of encephalitis had a positive rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF, the rest is suggested to be of para-infectious cause rather than a results of direct viral neuropathogenicity as shown by microvascular lesions on brain MRI suggesting potential implication of COVID-19 associates endothelitis or coagulopathy [19]. Additionally, single case reports with CSF positive for SARS-CoV-2 are very rare given the large number of patients world-wide. Another cross-sectional study also supports the hypothesis that para-infectious pro-inflammatory effects of COVID-19 are primarily responsible for neurological affections [4].",
            "Treatment approaches included corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), convalescent plasma, interferon beta and several antiviral drugs (lopinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir, favipavir, acyclovir) [3, 14, 21, 23]. Single case reports also support the evidence on successful treatment with immunoadsorption or IVIG [13].",
            "The most reported manifestation was GBS with 65 cases. The diagnosis of GBS was mainly based on existing diagnostic criteria such as the Hadden criteria or the Brighton diagnostic criteria. The diagnosis was verified by albumino-cytological dissociation as well as typical demyelinating patterns in the electromyography in several studies [3, 14, 19, 23]. Treatment approaches of GBS comprised IVIG, plasmapheresis and corticosteroids. In addition, antiretrovirals such as lopinavir and ritonavir were concomitantly used [3, 14, 19, 21, 23].",
            "Several disorders were reported under the category of skeletal muscle inflammation including rhabdomyolysis (54/378), myalgia (251/378) and elevated Creatine Kinase (CK) levels in the serum (73/378). All studies reported a raised serum CK in association with raised C-reactive-protein (CRP), myoglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase.",
            "Encephalopathy was defined differently in each study owing to the general lack of a standardized definition. Most definitions were symptom-based or partly symptom- and pathology-based, encompassing an alteration in the level of consciousness in the absence of signs of CNS inflammation [33]. Only two studies included the component of time, defining an encephalopathy as an altered mental status lasting over 24 h, associated with a seizure or focal neurological sign in the absence of encephalitis criteria, defined as COVID-19-associated if not accounted for by another toxic or metabolic cause [19] or as a pathobiological process that develops over hours to days and can manifest as changed personality, behaviour, cognition or consciousness [3]. Only Frontera et al. considered confounders such as sedatives, other drugs or hypotension as alternative causes of encephalopathic features in their definition of a COVID-19 associated encephalopathy [8]. Several symptoms were counted as presenting symptoms of encephalopathy such as seizures, altered mental state, altered level of consciousness or cognition, psychosis, delirium and pyramidal signs. As there are different aetiologies of encephalopathy it is difficult to validate the causality of a solely SARS-CoV-2 associated encephalopathy which could be seen in the context of a para-infectious inflammatory autoimmune reaction. If CSF or serum was examined for pathogens these were all found negative, including rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 [3, 21]. Laboratory parameters often showed abnormalities such as raised urea and nitrogen, acid-base disorders, electrolyte derangement and raised inflammatory markers (CRP, Procalcitonin) [3, 8, 15]. Neuroimaging was variably ranging from being normal (MRI/CT), over non-specific MRI changes to leptomeningeal enhancement. Coincidental findings of asymptomatic or previous strokes were also reported. If electroencephalography was performed it displayed diffuse bifrontal slowing or was unremarkable [3, 11, 21]. Treatment was largely supportive and symptomatic, and treatment approaches included corticosteroids, antiretrovirals, IVIG, LMWH and dialysis [3, 19, 21, 24].",
            "Several studies point towards an association between CVD and more severe disease. Two studies reported a mortality of 15% [19] and 38.5% respectively [23] for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with CVD. Fan et al. describe that AIS was associated with a longer period of hospitalization and higher mortality [5]. In a multicentre case study the rate of short-term mortality in COVID-19 patients with AIS was found as high as 15% (19/124). Nevertheless, they also report that five out of six patients improved or stabilized. In synopsis with the coagulopathy associated with COVID-19 infections this indicates that critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ischaemic stroke may benefit from anticoagulant therapy [5]. In contrast to that, in a prospective case series only two out of five patients with AIS had prothrombotic factors, and only 50% (2/4 patients) with cerebral venous thrombosis had demonstrable prothrombotic factors. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are likely contributory and they judge the excess mortality to be related to COVID-19 dysimmune coagulopathy [14].",
            "Outcomes were variable and often incomplete as most studies were published without follow-up data. One study reported a mortality of 4.8% and a recovery rate of 47% [19]. Ellul et al. found a mortality of 25% (2/8) but also a successful discharge home in 37.5% (3/8) of cases [3]. Out of four encephalitic patients, Koh et al. reported one who died (mortality 25%), three patients who did not respond to treatment and one who recovered [14].",
            "In the rapid review of Ellul et al. outcomes were split with one third receiving physiotherapy, one third being discharged and one third still ventilated at the time of publication [3]. In a retrospective observational cohort study, immunoglobulin treatment shortened recovery and improved disability score when administered in the early stage of GBS [23]. Two of 15 patients (13.33%) required mechanical ventilation, one of these had the acute-motor-sensory-axonal-neuropathy variant of GBS [3]. No death in 15 patients was reported from a retrospective multicentre case series [19].",
            "Treatment was reported as supportive in one study with good outcome as symptoms improved [3]. In contrast to that, Romero-Sanchez et al. found a longer stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) as an independent predictor in multivariate analysis (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.02–1.71, p = 0.03). However, uncertainty remains as to more than one symptom per patient was counted and therefore the primary manifestation could have been a different one with rhabdomyolysis being the result on the initial presenting complaint or a complication of ICU stay [24].",
            "Ellul et al. reported 49 patients with encephalopathy requiring an ICU stay and only one patient who did not. Liotta et al. described an overall longer hospital stay in patients with encephalopathy. In the prospective study of Frontera et al., encephalopathy was the most common diagnosis and especially common among patients with severe COVID-19 [8]. As to outcomes, Meppiel et al. reported a mortality rate of 14.8% and a recovery rate of 50.7%, while Paterson et al. reported a recovery rate of nearly 90% including partial recoveries.",
            "Encephalopathy was associated with worse outcome due to multifactorial reasons. Fan et al. report that patients with delirium could not tolerate non-invasive mechanical ventilation and were therefore referred to the ICU for invasive mechanical ventilation [5]. Liotta et al. report worse functional outcomes, higher mortality and morbidity for encephalopathy independent of respiratory disease severity [15]. Helms et al. found that acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-COV2 infection was associated with encephalopathy, prominent agitation, confusion, and corticospinal tract signs [11]. In a multicentre retrospective case series, the rate of short-term mortality in patients with COVID-19 associated encephalopathy was 14.9%. Meppiel et al. describe a high proportion of patients with encephalopathy having pre-existing neurodegenerative disorders which may reflect the fact that chronic cognitive impairment is a known risk factor for delirium in patients with acute illness [19].",
            "In this review we categorized neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 as reported in larger case series and noteworthy studies. We found that neurologic manifestations are generally associated with a higher morbidity and mortality as well as a worse outcome. Even though the exact rate of neurologic manifestations in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear it is vital to raise clinical awareness in order to recognize and treat patients early and adequately.",
            "One explanation for the high discrepancy between the rate of neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients ranging from 0.08 to 90% could be the generosity of case descriptions. If cases were pre-defined the rate was naturally much lower than if cases were included based on a non-systematic subjective description derived from medical records. Secondly the rate of neurologic manifestations is strongly dependent on the population that is examined, such as in Helms et al’s cohort where only patients admitted to ICU due to severe ARDS where included in contrast to Koh et al’s cohort where all microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 patients in Singapore where included [11, 14]. We strongly recommend using case definitions such as created by Ellul et al. for SARS-CoV-2 meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, or CNS vasculitis for future studies as these are the only standardised case definition for neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 to date.",
            "Even though PNS disorders including the presentation with anosmia and ageusia were quantitatively the most frequent manifestations, encephalopathies and cerebrovascular disorders are of more systemic relevance due to a higher association with morbidity and mortality. Encephalopathy in general is a misfortunately chosen term as by definition it means that there is a malfunction of the brain which is neither a pathophysiologic nor a clinical definition and its use certainly remains problematic. Whether anosmia and ageusia are always SARS-CoV-2-related remains questionable and until proven otherwise this generous association should be made with caution. The differentiation between local epithelial, PNS or CNS affection underlying these symptoms remains similarly challenging. Nevertheless, these were reported as the earliest neurologic symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections and any patient presenting with these features warrants investigation for the disease.",
            "An important issue raised by a review on neurobiology of COVID-19 applies to the proportion of neuro-inflammatory syndromes that are caused by direct viral affection of COVID-19 versus those that are caused by para- or post-infectious effects e.g. coagulopathy or endothelial inflammation [6]. This is still an ongoing controversy as valid data cannot be extracted if one does not aim to differentiate between these phenomena. Especially for CVD, thrombosis caused by endotheliitis and coagulopathy induced by hyperinflammation are suggested as the responsible pathomechanisms. We see the need to systematically perform CSF examination with PCR for SARS-CoV-2 genome and search for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with symptoms related to CNS involvement to assess the causality of SARS-CoV-2 associated CNS inflammatory syndromes. It is therefore desirable to design further neuropathological studies to improve our understanding of the underlying pathogenesis and to approach causality. One of the largest post-mortem case series showed that neuroinflammation in general was only mild with no evidence of CNS damage directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that para-infectious effects play a more important role than direct viral affection of the CNS [17].",
            "This review has several limitations. Considerable studies did not provide detailed enough data to compare distinct parameters across different studies which decreases the validity of such comparison. For example, the “break-through” publication on the topic by Mao et al. only provide little insight into their approach of categorization and describe several CNS manifestations such as cerebrovascular disease, dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, ataxia and seizures as one group without differentiating between symptoms, syndromes and diagnoses [16].",
            "Altered mental state was often accounted for as a presenting symptom and studies handled this very differently. Varatharaj et al. divided the presenting symptom of altered mental status between encephalitis, encephalopathy or neuropsychiatric disorders depending on the assumed underlying pathology [33]. Meppiel et al. grouped altered mental state under encephalopathy or encephalitis depending on the presence of signs of inflammation (elevated WBC in CSF or compatible lesions on MRI) [19]. Rifino et al. assigned altered mental state as a presenting symptom to subcategories such as encephalitis, necrotizing encephalitis and virus encephalitis depending on the assumed underlying pathology [23]. Our approach was rather based on the underlying pathology and not the presenting symptom. This may well have led to a loss of such cases during the rate assessment.",
            "The retrospective multicentre case series by Meppiel et al. was one of the few studies that actively excluded other possible aetiologies besides SARS-CoV-2 for encephalopathy and clearly defined neurological manifestations a priori [19]. Likewise, the observational case study of Paterson et al. which states that cases for which a more likely alternative pathology was found were excluded from the analysis even though the exact diagnostic exclusion is not specified [21]. The other studies did not account for alternative pathophysiological mechanisms such as Mao et al., where it could not at all be distinguished whether neurologic manifestations were caused by direct viral affection, pulmonary disease or other organ damage [16]. This issue applied to all other studies where no other pathogen or antibody investigations were done to exclude alternative aetiologies. Studies that counted more than one symptom or syndrome per patient were especially difficult to include as symptoms and syndromes were counted double or triple [24]. This made it impossible to extrapolate accurate numbers and only count valid diagnoses. Frontera et al. counted both new and existing neurological conditions and hence these could not be differentiated [8]. Finally, for the sake of specificity we completely ignored non-specific symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, etc. although some or even many of these may have reflected neurologic manifestations.",
            "This narrative review offers an approach to categorization of neurological manifestation based on several big case series. Robust estimation of the situation is strongly affected by discrepancies in case definitions, mixing symptoms/syndromes with diagnostic findings, differences in patient cohorts, and lack of systematic exclusion of alternative causes of neurologic disease. Further prospective studies are needed to better understand the underlying pathophysiology of neurological manifestations in COVID-19 disease including case control studies to ascertain the actual rate and relevance of such manifestations. These studies need systematic definitions of manifestations such as those proposed by us or used in very few existing studies [8, 19]. Furthermore, it would be desirable to collect additional data on outcome parameters such as ICU need, length of stay, ventilation need and duration, mortality, cause of death, outcome at discharge as well as discharge destination as already implemented by the NCS Global Consortium Study or by young neurologists who collect data from the Lean European Open Survey on Sars-CoV-2 Infected Patients on neurological manifestations [7, 12].",
            "In conclusion, all reviewed studies demonstrate that neurological manifestations are broad and heterogenous suggesting different underlying pathogenic processes and pathways. It is crucial to explore the causality of SARS-CoV-2 regarding neurological manifestations and to exclude likely alternative causes. Therefore, clearly defined, standardized, and universal case definitions should be used across countries. Even though neurologic manifestations might represent a relatively small part of COVID-19 phenomena, early recognition and treatment is key to prevent a more severe outcome associated with higher morbidity and mortality.",

            "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is marked by cardio-respiratory alterations, with increasing reports also indicating neurological and psychiatric symptoms in infected individuals. During COVID-19 pathology, the central nervous system (CNS) is possibly affected by direct severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invasion, exaggerated systemic inflammatory responses, or hypoxia. Psychosocial stress imposed by the pandemic further affects the CNS of COVID-19 patients, but also the non-infected population, potentially contributing to the emergence or exacerbation of various neurological or mental health disorders. Microglia are central players of the CNS homeostasis maintenance and inflammatory response that exert their crucial functions in coordination with other CNS cells. During homeostatic challenges to the brain parenchyma, microglia modify their density, morphology, and molecular signature, resulting in the adjustment of their functions. In this review, we discuss how microglia may be involved in the neuroprotective and neurotoxic responses against CNS insults deriving from COVID-19. We examine how these responses may explain, at least partially, the neurological and psychiatric manifestations reported in COVID-19 patients and the general population. Furthermore, we consider how microglia might contribute to increased CNS vulnerability in certain groups, such as aged individuals and people with pre-existing conditions.",
            "At the beginning of the pandemic, it was thought that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, affected only the respiratory system (Wang et al., 2020b). However, increasing reports of olfactory and taste symptoms in infected patients suggested possible central nervous system (CNS) damage (Agyeman et al., 2020). As the scenario evolved, further reports of neurological manifestations in COVID-19 appeared, such as encephalopathies, cerebrovascular disease, as well as psychiatric symptoms of depression or anxiety (Gautier and Ravussin, 2020; Giacomelli et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020; Poyiadji et al., 2020; Taquet et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b). At the same time, the pandemic broadly imposes a high degree of psychosocial stress (Brooks et al., 2020; McGinty et al., 2020; Pierce et al., 2020), a strong predictor of mental health disorders (Maes et al., 1998; Schneiderman et al., 2005), on the general population. Similar coronaviruses (CoVs), such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were also recently associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders, with a prevalence of 0.09% for SARS-CoV-1 and 0.36% for MERS-CoV (Ellul et al., 2020). Despite a seemingly low proportion, given the large number of reported COVID-19 cases [78,383,527, as of December 26th 2020 WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard (2020)], this may indicate approximately 70,545 people impacted, if a similar ratio is observed for the SARS-CoV-2 (Ellul et al., 2020).",
            "The cause of these diverse manifestations remains elusive. To help stimulate and orient further research on the consequences of COVID-19 on neurological and mental health, in this review, we discuss several putative origins, which include SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS, hypoxia-derived injuries in the brain, and the excessive circulation of inflammatory factors in COVID-19 affected individuals. Acting synergistically or not, we suggest how these factors trigger protective and neurotoxic responses by microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the CNS, along with their possible connections to the neurological and psychiatric manifestations encountered upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lastly, we consider the burden of the psychosocial stress imposed by the pandemic in both COVID-19 affected individuals and the general population. We cover how, even in the absence of infection, microglia might respond to stress and severely impact the mental health of vulnerable groups.",
            "The CNS-associated manifestations of COVID-19 could, in part, result from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brain. Two main routes for CNS invasion, based on either (i) neuronal or (ii) hematogenous transport (Figure 1), were proposed in the literature.",
            "During the COVID-19 pandemic, microglia respond to various central nervous system (CNS) insults, including viral infection, hypoxic injury, excessive circulating cytokines, and psychosocial stress. (Upper panel) Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can enter the brain via (1) peripherally infected neurons, or via (2) infected microvascular brain endothelial cells, and (3) infected infiltrating leukocytes. Infected cells, in turn, (4) release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are sensed by microglia, which respond by (5) becoming reactive. At the same time, COVID-19 pathology contributes to (1) low oxygen levels, likely driving hypoxic injuries in the brain. Neurons are extremely sensitive to oxygen deficits, becoming (2) quickly damaged, and (3) releasing DAMPs and PAMPs. This is sensed by (4) microglia, which respond by changing their morphology, molecular signature, and cytokine release. (Lower panel) COVID-19 is also associated with an exacerbated inflammatory response, marked by increased levels of (1) circulating cytokines, i.e., cytokine storm. These cytokines signal to the brain via different pathways, for example, (2) signaling through the blood–brain barrier (BBB), being quickly sensed by (3) microglia. Furthermore, excessive cytokines may drive (4) BBB disruption, which increases not only cytokine levels in the brain but also of (5) DAMPs and PAMPs associated with the systemic viral infection. Lastly, psychosocial stress drives the production of cortisol, catecholamines, and cytokines, released into the (1) circulation. Microglia can respond to all of these factors by becoming (2) reactive, likely driving dysfunctional (3) synaptic remodeling.",
            "The neuronal route relies on retrograde axonal transport from infected peripheral nerves, such as the olfactory or vagus nerves (Desforges et al., 2019; DosSantos et al., 2020). Many SARS-CoV-2 related viruses, including other CoVs, use olfactory nerve fibers to enter the CNS (Koyuncu et al., 2013). In transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, a high-affinity receptor for SARS-CoVs, intranasal SARS-CoV-1 administration resulted in olfactory nerve infection, progressively spreading to the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and midbrain (Netland et al., 2008). Similarly, in a patient who died from a severe respiratory failure associated with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were detected in the olfactory nerve, gyrus rectus, and brainstem (Bulfamante et al., 2020). Likewise, immunohistochemical analysis revealed SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the cranial nerves originating from the lower medulla oblongata and a high degree of reactive glial cells, i.e., gliosis, in the olfactory bulb of autopsied COVID-19 patients (Matschke et al., 2020). Infection of the olfactory system is also consistent with the frequent loss of smell and increased magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal measured in the olfactory cortex of patients (Lu et al., 2020; Politi et al., 2020). It is important to note, however, that it remains unclear whether ACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), another SARS-CoV-2 receptor, are expressed specifically by neurons of the olfactory system (Brann et al., 2020; DosSantos et al., 2020).",
            "Abundant ACE2 expression in small intestine endothelial cells (ECs) (Hamming et al., 2004), and the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 (Chen et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020b), also prompted a putative neuronal route involving the enteric nervous system. Indeed, this strategy has been proposed for several neurotropic viruses, including CoVs (DosSantos et al., 2020). For instance, intragastric inoculation with MERS-CoV in transgenic mice expressing human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) protein, the MERS-CoV receptor, led to enterocyte, lung, and brain infection (Zhou et al., 2017). The path used by these viruses to reach the CNS is unclear but they could follow the intestinal nervous plexuses and vagus nerve, reaching the brainstem through axonal transport (DosSantos et al., 2020). While the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in these nerves remains obscure, human small intestinal organoids have shown to be productively infected by the novel coronavirus (Lamers et al., 2020). Notably, enteric glial cells recognize and fight viruses, coordinating both innate and adaptive antiviral responses that are connected to neurological impairment, for example, via the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 (Esposito et al., 2020).",
            "Yet, SARS-CoV-2 could also use a hematogenous route, i.e., via the bloodstream, infecting brain microvascular ECs or leukocytes crossing the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to reach the CNS (Figure 1; Desforges et al., 2019). The BBB is composed of a monolayer of ECs joined by tight junctions, and it is covered by pericytes, as well as astrocytic (Abbott et al., 2006), and microglial endfeet (Joost et al., 2019). This structure limits almost all transcellular and paracellular transport from the blood to the brain parenchyma, protecting the CNS from pathogens and toxins (Abbott et al., 2006). In vitro human and rodent studies have suggested all components of the BBB can be infected by viruses (Chen and Li, 2020). Correspondingly, ACE2 protein is broadly present in ECs of post-mortem human brains (Hamming et al., 2004; Buzhdygan et al., 2020). Furthermore, budding of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles has been observed in the brain ECs of a deceased COVID-19 patient (Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020). In parallel, SARS-CoV-2 infiltration through the brain vasculature could be facilitated by BBB disruption (Alquisiras-Burgos et al., 2020). Endothelial infection increasing BBB permeability was associated with the mouse CoV, i.e., neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), through down-regulation of proteins forming the tight junctions between brain ECs, such as tight junction protein 1 (TJP1), cadherin 5, and occludin (Bleau et al., 2015). SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (subunits 1 and 2) also increased permeability of an in vitro 3D BBB model constituted of primary human brain ECs, as assessed by enhanced dextran perfusion and decreased TJP1 immunostaining (Buzhdygan et al., 2020). In brain ECs, this effect was accompanied by higher messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the (i) cytokines IL6 and IL1B, (ii) matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs) 2, 3, 9, and 12, involved in remodeling of the extracellular matrix; (iii) leukocyte chemotaxis factors, such as C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10); as well as protein expression of (iv) cell adhesion molecules, including intracellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (Buzhdygan et al., 2020).",
            "To reach the CNS, the SARS-CoV-2 could likewise use the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier, a more permeable barrier compared to the BBB, formed by a single layer of ECs of the choroid plexus (Pellegrini et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 receptors, including ACE2 and TMPRSS2, were detected in human choroid plexus organoids via transcriptomic and immunoblotting analysis (Pellegrini et al., 2020). Pellegrini et al. (2020) also observed that SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate infected choroid plexus but not neuronal organoids; and this infection led to a disruption of tight junctions, labeled by claudin 5 (CLDN5), and an overall breakdown of barrier integrity. Although similar reports are rare, in a case series examining 30 COVID-19 patients with neurologic symptoms, five showed a high CSF-blood albumin ratio, suggesting either BBB or blood-CSF barrier disruption (Neumann et al., 2020). Lastly, instead of using the endothelium, SARS-CoV-2 CNS invasion could occur via infected immune cells that infiltrate the brain. Yet, only macrophages were positive for the virus according to single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of bronchoalveolar lavage samples from COVID-19 patients (Bost et al., 2020). Of note, this finding could be due to phagocytosis of the viral components or infected cells, and not necessarily to viral propagation. Additionally, thus far, autopsy series of deceased COVID-19 patients did not show marked peripheral immune cell infiltration in the brain (Iadecola et al., 2020), and dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 into the blood has been described in inconsistent proportions, ranging from 1 (Wang et al., 2020b) to 41% (Zheng et al., 2020).",
            "The path used by SARS-CoV-2 to invade the CNS remains puzzling, along with the fate of the virus once it reaches the brain. On one hand, human neural organoids seem to be limited in their ability to support SARS-CoV-2 replication (Pellegrini et al., 2020; Ramani et al., 2020). On the other, dopaminergic neurons derived from human pluripotent cells were found to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, but not cortical neurons, brain ECs, macrophages, or microglia (Yang et al., 2020a); despite the RNA expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in several CNS cell types. According to human brain single-cell RNA-seq, ACE2 is expressed in many neuronal subtypes, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Matschke et al., 2020). Expression of TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 was most elevated in neurons, whereas cathepsin L (CTSL), necessary for viral entry and replication, was highest in microglia (Matschke et al., 2020). However, the protein expression of these receptors in the CNS still needs to be investigated, along with SARS-CoV-2 ability to replicate in the different brain cell types in vivo.",
            "Notably, SARS-CoV-2 CNS invasion is also supported by viral detection in both the CSF and brain of COVID-19 patients (Bulfamante et al., 2020; Domingues et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Kremer et al., 2020; Matschke et al., 2020; Moriguchi et al., 2020; Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020; Puelles et al., 2020; Solomon et al., 2020; Virhammar et al., 2020). It is clear, though, that presence of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF is rare (Domingues et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Kremer et al., 2020; Moriguchi et al., 2020; Virhammar et al., 2020). For example, in a study with 31 CSF human samples, only one was positive for SARS-CoV-2 via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence), despite increased CSF markers of inflammation, such as high protein count or elevated immunoglobulin G in all of them (Kremer et al., 2020). Similarly, several other studies evaluating a total of 30 COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations did not detect SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF by RT-qPCR (targeting E and nucleocapsid genes) (Al Saiegh et al., 2020; Al-Dalahmah et al., 2020; Alexopoulos et al., 2020; Filatov et al., 2020; Helms et al., 2020; Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020; Schaller et al., 2020). At the same time, definite proof of SARS-CoV-2 invasion in the brain via autopsied tissue, while limited, was reported in patients showing severe COVID-19 and a history of previous chronic diseases (Matschke et al., 2020). Using electron microscopy, the first report detected viral particles in brain ECs and frontal lobe neurons of a 74-years old patient with a history of Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were also uncovered in the brainstem of another COVID-19 deceased patient (see section “Neuronal Route”) (Bulfamante et al., 2020). Later on, five out of 18 (Solomon et al., 2020) and eight out of 22 (Puelles et al., 2020) post-mortem human brains were shown to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (E and nucleocapsid genes) but negative for immunohistochemical analysis of nucleocapsid (Solomon et al., 2020) and spike (Puelles et al., 2020) proteins. Yet, in the largest study published so far, 21 out of 40 affected individuals displayed both SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins in the brain, based on RT-qPCR (E gene) and immunohistochemistry (nucleocapsid and spike proteins) (Matschke et al., 2020).",
            "Inconsistent SARS-CoV-2 detection in the CNS and CSF contributes to the great uncertainty around the novel coronavirus’ level of neurotropism. For instance, in one study, the virus was undetectable in CSF despite being present in the patient’s brain (Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020). Similarly, brain samples of eight patients were negative for viral RNA yet immunopositive for the spike or nucleocapsid proteins in another study (Matschke et al., 2020). Even more intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 was reported in the CSF of one patient without respiratory symptoms (Huang et al., 2020). Conflicting results for RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 detection in CSF, and between RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry in the brain, reveal a need for more cohesion in tests to properly estimate the prevalence of brain infection (Murta et al., 2020). Similarly, since the putative routes and outcomes for CNS invasion are drawn mostly from correlative data, it is imperative to directly investigate what pathway(s) are used by SARS-CoV-2 and if productive infections can be generated in the brain. In the event of SARS-CoV-2 brain infection, the fate of CNS function relies on antiviral defenses; and microglia, as the resident innate immune cells of the brain, could hinder viral spread, as discussed below.",
            "Microglia, contrary to all the other CNS cells, arise from erythro-myeloid progenitors in the fetal yolk sac and are present in the brain during embryonic development, self-renewing throughout life (Ajami et al., 2007; Ginhoux et al., 2010; Tay et al., 2017b). These cells are central players in the inflammatory response of the brain, i.e., neuroinflammation, in most if not all physical, infectious, psychiatric, or neurodegenerative-related insults to the CNS. Microglia are also essential for brain development, plasticity, and homeostasis, contributing to (i) the turnover (both elimination and survival) of neuronal precursors and neurons, (ii) oligodendrocyte progenitor cell maturation, (iii) neuronal wiring, (iv) synaptic maturation, activity, and plasticity, (v) myelination, as well as (vi) BBB integrity, and (vii) blood flow regulation (Tay et al., 2017b). Considering their diverse role in the brain’s immune and physiological functions, we hypothesize that microglia respond to direct SARS-CoV-2 CNS infection and changes in the CNS imposed by systemic COVID-19 response. In addition to microglia, peripheral immune cells, derived from the bone marrow, and able to enter the CNS from the circulation throughout life, such as T lymphocytes and macrophages, could assist microglia with the response to COVID-19 (Zhao et al., 2014; Wheeler et al., 2018; Klein et al., 2019; Theret et al., 2019; Mangale et al., 2020).",
            "Innate immunity is fundamental for viral clearance in the CNS. This response is initiated by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus that, similarly to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, is thought to produce double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules during replication. PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), or the cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RLRs), recognize these PAMPs; TLR3 and RLRs, including the DEAD/H box helicase 58 and the interferon induced with helicase C domain 1, recognize dsRNAs, whereas TLR7 and TLR8 recognize ssRNAs (de Wit et al., 2016; Carty et al., 2021). These PRRs are expressed mainly by microglia (Kumar, 2019; Carty et al., 2021), but also by neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, and brain ECs (Klein et al., 2019; Chen and Li, 2020). Activation of TLRs and RLRs leads to the expression of type I interferons (IFN) via the interferon regulatory factor 3/7, and of pro-inflammatory cytokines via the nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB), thereby initiating an antiviral cascade (Carty et al., 2021).",
            "Upon binding of cytokines, DAMPs, and PAMPs to their appropriate receptors, microglia initiate an inflammatory response (Klein et al., 2019), changing their gene expression, morphology, and function in a process known as “reactivity” or “microgliosis” (though previously termed “activation”) (Hoogland et al., 2015; Savage et al., 2019). Among their adjustments, in rodents, microglia (similar to peripheral macrophages in the brain) can up-regulate protein expression of the ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1), the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII), and the phagolysosomal marker cluster of differentiation (CD) 68 (Jurga et al., 2020). Reactive microglia can proliferate and increase the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL1B, IL6, IFNG] as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) or nitric oxide (NO) which, balanced by concomitant anti-inflammatory cytokine release by microglia, help restore homeostasis (Lund et al., 2006; Block et al., 2007; Cunningham, 2013). Besides, reactive microglia generally adopt different morphologies, for example, shifting to amoeboid shapes with bigger somas and less ramified processes, as opposed to the steady-state, highly branched “surveilling” phenotype (Figure 1; Savage et al., 2019; Tremblay et al., 2020). Accordingly, increased IBA1 immunostaining and less ramified CX3C chemokine receptor (CX3CR1)-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive microglial cells were observed in the olfactory bulb of MHV infected mice (Wheeler et al., 2018). Increased IBA1-positive microglial cells were also described in mice expressing the human ACE2 protein, 6 days following intranasal SARS-CoV-1 infection (Netland et al., 2008).",
            "Reactive microglial phenotypes can secrete antiviral factors, such as IFNs and IL6 (Klein et al., 2019). However, other cells can compensate for this release in the absence of normal levels of microglia (Wheeler et al., 2018). This has been shown by manipulating signaling through the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), a receptor tyrosine kinase required for the development, maintenance, and proliferation of microglia (Ginhoux et al., 2010; Erblich et al., 2011; Elmore et al., 2014). Using its antagonist PLX5622 to significantly deplete CSFR1-positive cells, including microglia (but not the resident CD45-high macrophage population that can infiltrate the CNS from the circulation), Wheeler et al. (2018) showed Ifnb, Ifna, Il6 mRNA levels were not changed in mouse brains infected with neuro-attenuated rJ2.2 strain of the murine hepatitis virus (JMHV). Similarly, in the case of a neurovirulent strain of MHV, gene set enrichment analysis from single-cell RNA-seq of ex vivo CD45-high cells isolated from the brain revealed enrichment of IFN-response genes in peripheral macrophages and dendritic cells of infected versus non-infected PLX5622-treated mice (Mangale et al., 2020). This compensatory mechanism is also supported by in vitro studies showing that murine astrocytic cells are important sources of IFNA/B after infection with MHV strain A59 (Savarin and Bergmann, 2018; Lavi and Cong, 2020).",
            "Similarly to other CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can infect and drive permeability of an in vitro human BBB model (Bleau et al., 2015; Buzhdygan et al., 2020). BBB disruption, in turn, can enhance the entry of peripheral immune cells and inflammatory factors in the brain to help fight the infection. Although microglia do not appear to be critical for overall immune cell infiltration (Figure 1), they are crucial for initiating the antiviral responses of peripheral cells. For instance, significant reductions in the microglial population (mediated by PLX5622) early (0 and 6 days) after intracranial JMHV infection severely impacted viral restriction, resulting in an increased viral load and a higher mortality rate of mice (Wheeler et al., 2018). Microglial depletion (i) disrupted antigen-presentation, and consequently CD4-positive T cell and regulatory T cell (Treg) antiviral responses, and (ii) led to immature macrophage infiltration (Wheeler et al., 2018; Mangale et al., 2020). Conversely, peripheral cells seem to be important for microglial regulation. Intravenous administration of Foxp3-positive CD4 regulatory T cells recognizing the viral MHV M133 epitope 24 h before MHV infection decreased microglial MHCII protein expression and limited T helper type 1 (Th1) cell response, improving survival of mice (Zhao et al., 2014). The close interactions between brain resident immune cells and virus-specific T cells are also supported by significant gene expression changes in pathways related to (i) antigen presentation, (ii) crosstalk between the innate and adaptive immune systems, (iii) IFN signaling, (iv) IFN-regulatory factors, (v) PRRs, and (vi) chemokines in microglia from MHV infected mice compared to controls (Wheeler et al., 2018).",
            "While coordinating the antiviral response, microglia can themselves become infected. This has been shown for CoVs including the human coronavirus OC43, as well as the murine strains MHV and JHMV (Bonavia et al., 1997; Arbour et al., 1999; Nakagaki et al., 2005; Das Sarma, 2014; Lavi and Cong, 2020). Although, except for MHV, this infection of microglia was observed only at low levels, and mostly in immortalized cell lines from humans and mice, which do not necessarily correlate with in vivo conditions (Bonavia et al., 1997; Arbour et al., 1999; Nakagaki et al., 2005; Das Sarma, 2014; Lavi and Cong, 2020). Evidence from different viral families suggests that upon direct infection, microglia show signs of reactivity. For example, in primary microglial cultures from rats, the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) drives a change from a process-bearing morphology to an amoeboid and CD68-positive cell, characteristic of a phagocytic phenotype (Chen et al., 2010). Remarkably, this morphological shift seemed to be induced by soluble components released by infected cells and not by active viral replication (Chen et al., 2010). Initial results with human microglial cells derived from pluripotent cells argue these cells are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, despite ACE2 protein and CTSL mRNA expression (Matschke et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020a) [though further research in humans is necessary to confirm this finding].",
            "Among the reports evaluating microglial markers in post-mortem brain tissue from COVID-19 cases, one detected SARS-CoV-2 brain invasion in 21 out of 40 patients (see also section “Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 Brain Infection”) (Matschke et al., 2020). Matschke et al. (2020) observed diffuse staining for IBA1 and the microglial enriched marker transmembrane protein 119 (TMEM119), with occasional microglial nodules, i.e., microglial clusters, among the brainstem and cerebellum in 29 out of 32 tested COVID-19 patients. In the subpial and subependymal regions, IBA1-positive microglia were frequently seen surrounded by CD8-positive T cells, and strongly expressed CD68, as well as the human leukocyte antigen DR isotype (HLA-DR, an MHCII receptor) (Matschke et al., 2020). However, it is not clear if the same patients who had detectable brain levels of SARS-CoV-2 were also those that showed an increase in these microglial markers (Matschke et al., 2020). Up-regulated microglial protein expression of IBA1, CD68, TMEM119, as well as HLA-DR, and their proximity to T cells, could indicate active phagocytosis of antigens to drive T cell activation and CNS infiltration following viral infection, as observed previously with other CoVs (Wheeler et al., 2018; Mangale et al., 2020). At the same time, the changes in microglia detected in this work could stem from or be potentiated by a response to the systemic COVID-19, which on its own is associated, for example, with hypoxic brain damage, as will be discussed next.",
            "Although 81% of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals present mild pneumonia, severe disease-associated hypoxia is observed in around 14%, critical disease in 5%, and death in 2.3% of patients (Wu and McGoogan, 2020). In severe cases, the most expressive pathological consequences of COVID-19 include massive alveolar damage, heart failure, coagulopathy, and cerebrovascular disease, including ischemic events (Aggarwal et al., 2020; Carsana et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020b; Helms et al., 2020; Klok et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020; Oxley et al., 2020). All factored in, these systemic changes likely drive hypoxic brain injury (Figure 1; Iadecola et al., 2020). Consistently, COVID-19 patients often present symptoms related to CNS hypoxia, such as headache, drowsiness, and coma, as well as brain lesions (Chen et al., 2020a; Giacomelli et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020; Pezzini and Padovani, 2020; Wu et al., 2020a). In brain autopsies of COVID-19 patients, widespread microthrombi and patches of infarction have also been detected, together with neuronal damage in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, i.e., brain areas highly vulnerable to hypoxia (Kantonen et al., 2020; Kashani et al., 2020; Solomon et al., 2020) [although these injuries could also be present before COVID-19].",
            "Ischemic-hypoxic brain injury is partially produced by a switch to anaerobic metabolism in brain cells, leading to (i) accumulation of lactic acid in the parenchyma, (ii) oxidative stress, (iii) BBB dysfunction, (iv) cerebral vasodilation, (v) swelling of neurons, (vi) obstruction of blood flow, (vii) inflammation, and (viii) cell death (Fumagalli et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2020b). Microglia rely on ATP to reorganize their cytoskeleton and monitor the brain parenchyma (Atkinson et al., 2004; Davalos et al., 2005; Masuda et al., 2011; Gimeno-Bayón et al., 2014), making them highly sensitive to energy deficits (Fumagalli et al., 2015). During COVID-19-associated hypoxia, it is therefore likely that changes in the ATP micro gradient are sensed by microglial purinergic P2X and P2Y receptors, promoting their migration to the injury site, phagocytosis, and proliferation, as observed in hypoxic injuries of rodents and humans (Davalos et al., 2005; Melani et al., 2006; Wixey et al., 2009; Webster et al., 2013; Fukumoto et al., 2019).",
            "Hypoxia also triggers rodent microglial transcription factors (e.g., hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha subunit and NFKB), and micro RNAs (miR-s) (e.g., miR-146a, and miR181a/c), both in vitro and in vivo; resulting in the release of TNFA, ROS, IL1B, and IL18, which can help clear cellular debris and resolve the injury (Zhang et al., 2012; Kong et al., 2014; Kiernan et al., 2016; Mukandala et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020b). In response to ischemia-hypoxia, rodent microglia likewise transform morphologically (see Figure 1; Masuda et al., 2011). Acutely, in the cerebral cortex, mouse microglia expand their processes to reach the hypoxic area (Davalos et al., 2005; Hines et al., 2009), but in larger or more sustained injuries, microglia can also adopt an amoeboid morphology (as observed during viral infections) among the hippocampus and neocortex of rodents (Raivich et al., 1999; Stence et al., 2001; Kurpius et al., 2007; Masuda et al., 2011). Whether microglia could react similarly during COVID-19 pathology awaits further research.",
            "Reactive microglia can perform neurotoxic and neuroprotective roles after hypoxic-ischemic injury. Disrupting fractalkine-mediated neuron-microglia signaling, by knocking out CX3CR1 in mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced ischemia, decreased the proliferation of microglia, release of inflammatory molecules, and infiltration of macrophages, culminating in a smaller ischemic lesion (Fumagalli et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2014). Contrastingly, combining PLX3397 driven microglial depletion with high-resolution two-photon calcium imaging in vivo, Szalay et al. (2016) showed 24 h after MCAO that microglial depletion impaired neuronal calcium responses and network activity, while increasing intracellular calcium levels, ultimately leading to exacerbated neuronal damage in mice. Yet, peripheral administration of minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic that non-specifically normalizes microglial phagocytosis and release of pro-inflammatory mediators (Tikka and Koistinaho, 2001; Tikka et al., 2001; Hanisch and Kettenmann, 2007), attenuated neuronal death in rodent models of ischemia (Yrjänheikki et al., 1998, 1999). Thus, similar to what was previously discussed in section “Putative Responses of Microglia to SARS-CoV-2 CNS Infection” (regarding depleting microglia during CNS viral infection), while completely disrupting microglial function can worsen injury recovery, down-regulating their inflammatory response can be protective. Of note, minocycline treatment has been proposed for COVID-19 (Oliveira et al., 2020).",
            "Microglial nodules and elevated immunostaining for microglial reactivity markers (e.g., IBA1, HLA-DR, and CD68) were detected in numerous brain autopsies of COVID-19 patients also showing recent and older hypoxic/ischemic injuries (Al-Dalahmah et al., 2020; Kantonen et al., 2020; Matschke et al., 2020), accompanied by marked neuronal loss among the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, medulla, and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer (Al-Dalahmah et al., 2020; Solomon et al., 2020). In a patient showing severe global hypoxic changes with hypereosinophilic, shrunken neurons, microglial CD68-positive nodules were surrounding the injured cells in the inferior olives and dentate nuclei, possibly indicating active phagocytic removal (Al-Dalahmah et al., 2020). However, at this point, it is difficult to evaluate whether the observed changes in the resident immune cells stem from the hypoxic injuries associated with the COVID-19. Reactive microglia may arise due to other systemic changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the exacerbated peripheral immune response (Al-Dalahmah et al., 2020), as we consider next.",
            "A well-coordinated immune response represents the first line of defense against viral infection. Yet, if exacerbated, this response may become detrimental, at both the viral entry site and systemic levels. As previously reported for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV (Channappanavar and Perlman, 2017), a maladaptive innate and adaptive immune response is a hallmark of COVID-19 pathology (Qin et al., 2020). Its most apparent characteristic is an ostensible hyper-inflammation, popularly termed “cytokine storm” prevalent in severely affected patients and significantly contributing to multi-organ failure (Bhaskar et al., 2020; Moore and June, 2020; Ruan et al., 2020). The putative origin of this phenomenon lies in a three-step process, consisting of an initial immune activation, a secondary delayed but possibly prolonged antiviral IFN-mediated response, and an uncontrolled monocyte-macrophage-dendritic cell hyperactivation as well as tissue infiltration (Channappanavar and Perlman, 2017; Merad and Martin, 2020; Moore and June, 2020). Such a process may induce vascular and organ damage on the cellular level and contribute to overall inefficient handling of viral load due to sub-optimal T- and B-cell responses (Channappanavar and Perlman, 2017). Accordingly, a reduction in serum lymphocytes is observed in a subset of COVID-19 patients (Bhaskar et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020). Within the cytokine storm framework, elevated circulating levels of an extensive variety of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL1; IL1R1; IL6; IL8; IL7; IL10; IL12; IFNG; Transforming growth factor b; CCL2; CXCL10; CXCL9; CX3CL10; CCR1) as well as non-cytokine markers (C-reactive protein, CRP; CSF2; D-dimer; ferritin), were reported in COVID-19 patients up to this point (Heneka et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020; Merad and Martin, 2020; Ruan et al., 2020). It should be noted, however, that the profile of this systemic inflammatory response, in terms of individual markers, varied between cohorts, which could either be a consequence of specific profiling of these initial studies or be reflective of a strong individual-specific nature of this response.",
            "Systemic cytokines communicate with the CNS via several pathways, including (i) migration through leaky regions of the BBB, such as the circumventricular organs; (ii) active transport by cytokine-specific transporters expressed on the brain ECs; (iii) activation of brain ECs leading to the production of second messengers; (iv) transmission of the signal via the vagus nerve, and (v) entry via peripherally activated immune cells (Capuron and Miller, 2011). In the CNS, controlled levels of these soluble substances including IL1B, TNF, and IL6 are necessary for the proper function of both neurons and glial cells (Camacho-Arroyo et al., 2009; Borsini et al., 2015). During infection, systemic cytokines stimulate neuroendocrine responses via the activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the elevation of the core body temperature, ultimately promoting disease-specific behavioral patterns (i.e., sickness behavior), such as lethargy and reduced appetite (Szelényi, 2001; Dantzer, 2018). In the long-term, however, elevated cytokine levels in the brain parenchyma (Figure 1) serve as a mediator of neurotoxic and neurodegenerative pathology across various disease conditions (Szelényi, 2001; Camacho-Arroyo et al., 2009).",
            "In the context of COVID-19, pathological excess of cytokines may lead to vascular remodeling and BBB leakage, increasing the entry of DAMPs and PAMPs associated with the peripheral viral infection (Figure 1), which could be especially risky in individuals whose BBB is already impaired due to pre-existing disease conditions (Varatharaj and Galea, 2017). This is in line with MRI-detected BBB-related abnormalities present in COVID-19 patients, such as the frequent occurrence of microbleeds, especially in white matter regions (Fitsiori et al., 2020; Kremer et al., 2020; Radmanesh et al., 2020). This BBB permeability may be primarily driven by (i) systemic events, such as tight junction alterations observed in diabetes (Hawkins et al., 2007), which is a risk factor for COVID-19 complications (Guo et al., 2020); or (ii) via direct viral infection of brain ECs (Buzhdygan et al., 2020); and, possibly, (iii) hypercoagulation and associated microthrombi formation, as was previously observed in COVID-19 patients (Dolhnikoff et al., 2020). On the other hand, viral entry and the neuroinflammatory response may even precede BBB impairment, as it has been stipulated for JEV-infected mice (Li et al., 2015; Pezzini and Padovani, 2020).",
            "Considering their key roles in brain homeostasis and neuroinflammation, microglia are particularly sensitive to environmental perturbations (see section “Putative Responses of Microglia to SARS-CoV-2 CNS Infection”) (Hanisch and Kettenmann, 2007; Hoogland et al., 2015). Thus, the increase in circulating cytokines during COVID-19 may induce or exacerbate microglial reactivity (Figure 1; Tremblay et al., 2020), likely worsening the direct viral or hypoxic injuries possibly present in the patients. The long-term duration of the systemic cytokine storm could contribute to a chronically reactive microglial state, adversely impacting the survival of neurons and maintenance of synaptic connections via inflammatory signaling, phagocytosis, and oxidative stress (Savage et al., 2019). Accordingly, in a patient with increased CSF and serum levels of IL6, IL8, and TNF, the microglial marker triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), associated with neurodegenerative diseases and phagocytosis, was also increased in the CSF, indicating an active inflammatory process in the spinal cord meningeal space (Pilotto et al., 2020a,b). Likewise, the expansion of inflammatory-oriented microglial clusters marked by increased intensity of IBA1, HLA-DR, and CD68 immunoreactivity and increased density of microglial nodules found in post-mortem brains of COVID-19 patients would be in line with this ongoing microgliosis (Mukandala et al., 2016; Matschke et al., 2020). Microgliosis, further possibly accompanied by astrogliosis and brain infiltration of peripheral T-lymphocytes, was mostly localized within the cerebellum and the brainstem of COVID-19 patients (Mukandala et al., 2016; Matschke et al., 2020). Similarly, in mice, the brainstem is among the brain areas most affected by SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infection (McCray et al., 2007; Netland et al., 2008; DosSantos et al., 2020). As the brainstem is responsible for vital brain functions (e.g., regulation of cardiac and respiratory functions, sleep cycles, and consciousness), this may be of relevance for the development of breathing difficulties associated with COVID-19 (Nouri-Vaskeh et al., 2020). However, as the cohorts analyzed in the above-mentioned studies are still quite small, further research is necessary to confirm these observations.",
            "Although data is still emerging, reports are indicating that presently, approximately 30% of COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized display neurological symptoms (Helms et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020), which include malaise, headache, and loss of smell (anosmia) and taste (dysgeusia) (Mao et al., 2020), as well as more serious complications, such as ischemic stroke [associated with significantly higher mortality] (Merkler et al., 2020; Yaghi et al., 2020). Drawing on what has been discussed in the previous sections, next we propose how the neurological abnormalities observed in COVID-19 patients could be related to the neuroinflammation resulting from microglial responses to viral, hypoxic, and inflammatory insults.",
            "Many patients with COVID-19 exhibit symptoms of dysgeusia or anosmia (Eshraghi et al., 2020). Taste buds are regenerated from a stem cell population in the nasal epithelium, the activity of which can be stalled by pro-inflammatory cytokines (Eshraghi et al., 2020). Correspondingly, there are increased serum levels of TNF, IFNG, and IL6 in confirmed COVID-19 patients (Eshraghi et al., 2020). In other diseases where anosmia is seen, it is associated with injury of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that project to the olfactory bulb, which may drive local microglia to adopt a pro-inflammatory state, contributing to overall neuroinflammation and cell death (Mahalaxmi et al., 2020). Collectively or not, it is thus possible that exacerbated inflammatory responses or CNS hypoxic injuries in COVID-19 patients contribute to these symptoms.",
            "The production of inflammatory mediators as a result of brain viral infection, in particular IFNs (MacMicking, 2012), is associated with encephalitis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the brain parenchyma and neurological dysfunction (Alam et al., 2020). While a few cases of encephalitis associated with COVID-19 were reported, it has been suggested that the symptoms used to diagnose the syndrome could be attributed to other conditions in the patients, such as hypoxia, inflammation, and sedation, which lead to encephalopathies (Garg et al., 2020; Iadecola et al., 2020; Maas, 2020). Common in older, hospitalized COVID-19 patients who present exaggerated systemic inflammation (i.e., cytokine storm), encephalopathy is a pathological process that is characterized by diffuse brain dysfunction (Garg et al., 2020; Helms et al., 2020; Najjar et al., 2020). These patients sometimes present anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and inflammatory markers in the CSF, such as IL6 and IL8 (Alexopoulos et al., 2020; Farhadian et al., 2020; Garg et al., 2020), suggesting encephalopathies could also result from viral infection in the brain [although comprehensive studies are currently lacking].",
            "The presence of anti-viral antibodies and cytokines in the CSF also indicates a potential disruption of the BBB, which may allow for increased inflammatory mediator infiltration into the brain. Enhanced BBB permeability is in line with MRI findings, such as microbleeds, in COVID-19 patients (see section “Microglia Respond to the Systemic Inflammatory Response in COVID-19”) (Fitsiori et al., 2020; Kremer et al., 2020; Radmanesh et al., 2020). Synergistically or not, these stimuli could lead to phenotypic changes of microglia, as supported by post-mortem brain autopsies of COVID-19 patients (see section “Putative Responses of Microglia to SARS-CoV-2 CNS Infection”) (Deigendesch et al., 2020; Matschke et al., 2020). In parallel, a recent report showed enhanced TREM2 protein levels in the CSF of a patient with COVID-19-associated encephalopathy, along with increased protein levels of IL6, IL8, and TNF in both CSF and serum (see section “Microglia Respond to the Systemic Inflammatory Response in COVID-19”) (Pilotto et al., 2020b). The patient robustly responded to steroid treatment, further supporting the argument that the observed encephalopathy was related to a CNS-inflammatory induced event (Pilotto et al., 2020b). While this awaits further research, reactive microglia may contribute to worsening encephalopathy prognosis by ensuing neuroinflammation in COVID-19.",
            "Increased microglial cytokine production, associated or not with BBB breakdown, can also lead to enhanced neuronal excitability and excitotoxic glutamate signaling, possibly provoking seizures, a clinical manifestation of encephalopathies present in COVID-19 patients (Nikbakht et al., 2020). Still, the generation of these seizures may be linked to other microglia-related pathways, including (i) ischemic stroke–which may be due to a microglial response to angiotensin II (see section “Cerebrovascular Disease”), and (ii) mitochondrial dysregulation–which may be caused by an increase in microglial production of ROS (Nikbakht et al., 2020). In mice, excessive extracellular glutamate recruits microglia (Dissing-Olesen et al., 2014; Eyo et al., 2014, 2018), and impairs their phagocytic activity in different epilepsy models (Abiega et al., 2016; Sierra-Torre et al., 2020). Both the microglial recruitment and phagocytosis uncoupling in these models were connected to the disruption of ATP signaling (Eyo et al., 2014, 2018; Abiega et al., 2016; Sierra-Torre et al., 2020), which, as discussed in sections “Microglia Mediate How the CNS Is Affected by SARS-CoV-2 Infection” and “Microglia Could Determine How the CNS Is Affected by COVID-19 Pathology,” can occur during viral and hypoxic injuries. Therefore, during COVID-19, not only can microglia contribute to the onset of seizures, but their reparative activity may also be impaired by the SARS-CoV-2-CNS-related insults.",
            "In the periphery, there are several inflammatory changes associated with COVID-19, one being the activation of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome (Freeman and Swartz, 2020; van den Berg and te Velde, 2020), which potentially contributes to generating the previously discussed cytokine storm (Mehta et al., 2020). In the brain, activation of this inflammasome is a risk factor for developing or worsening multiple sclerosis (Soares et al., 2019) and also Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (see section “Neurodegenerative Diseases”) (Tejera et al., 2019; Heneka et al., 2020), potentially through shifting microglia and macrophages toward pro-inflammatory phenotypes leading to demyelination (Di Stadio et al., 2020). Remarkably, multifocal brain demyelination has been observed in a few cases of COVID-19 (Handa et al., 2020; Zanin et al., 2020). In mice, microglia phagocytose myelin after damage, a crucial step in remyelination (Lampron et al., 2015; Domingues et al., 2020). By contrast, excessive microglial antiviral IFNG response is thought to be the major cause of demyelination in a mouse model of encephalomyelitis (Savarin and Bergmann, 2018). Whether demyelination in COVID-19 is a result of viral or inflammatory-mediated process(es) remains to be investigated, yet, in either case, microglial cytokine production and phagocytosis are likely implicated in this response.",
            "Although the numbers are increasing rapidly, at least 200 cases of cerebrovascular disease have been reported in association with COVID-19, the majority being caused by ischemic strokes (Ellul et al., 2020; Varatharaj et al., 2020). Accordingly, new and older hypoxic/ischemic injuries were present in numerous brain autopsies of COVID-19 patients (Al-Dalahmah et al., 2020; Kantonen et al., 2020; Matschke et al., 2020; Schaller et al., 2020; Solomon et al., 2020; Weyhern et al., 2020), sometimes accompanied by neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer (Solomon et al., 2020), as well as brainstem (see section “Microglia Respond to COVID-19-Associated Hypoxia”) (Al-Dalahmah et al., 2020; Weyhern et al., 2020). While most affected patients either already suffer from or belong to high-risk groups for cerebrovascular comorbidities, SARS-CoV-2 seems to increase the risk/rate/prevalence of stroke even in more resilient younger individuals (Ellul et al., 2020). The high incidence of stroke in COVID-19 affected individuals may be partially explained by SARS-CoV-2-associated ECs damage, activating thrombotic and inflammatory pathways, in the CNS and systemically (Varga et al., 2020). Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 is proposed to, through signaling at the angiotensin type I receptor (AT1R) expressed by microglia, increase the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Murta et al., 2020), further inducing vasoconstriction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cell death (Arroja et al., 2016).",
            "Acute brain hypoxia deriving from systemic COVID-19 and cerebrovascular disease could direct microglial activity toward increased phagocytosis contributing to abnormal neuroplasticity (Serrano-Castro et al., 2020). Reports using pharmacological or genetic depletion of microglia in mice showed a severe reduction of stroke-related injury (Fumagalli et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2014). At the same time, inflammation contributes to injury recovery, helping in immune cell recruitment, scar formation, and astrocytic reactivity (Kim and Cho, 2016). The heterogeneity in microglial phenotypes and subtypes increasingly reported in the literature is proposed as an explanation for the seemingly opposite effects, both neurotoxic and neuroprotective, of these cells observed upon hypoxic/ischemic injury (Stratoulias et al., 2019; Lyu et al., 2020). Despite the lack of comprehensive studies assessing recent territorial ischemic lesions and microglial functions during COVID-19, all autopsied patients with hypoxic injury also showed a history of at least one comorbidity, such as hypertension, diabetes, kidney failure, or obesity among others (Kantonen et al., 2020; Matschke et al., 2020; Schaller et al., 2020; Solomon et al., 2020; Weyhern et al., 2020). Although it is unclear whether these ischemic lesions stem from current COVID-19 infection, comorbidities linked to heightened inflammation, such as pulmonary and cardiac diseases, may indirectly influence microglial reactivity and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Patterson, 2015).",
            "In contexts where microglia are already primed, a secondary immune challenge, such as SARS-CoV-2 infection, may further direct their activity toward neurotoxicity (Serrano-Castro et al., 2020). Primed microglia are thought to abnormally perform their physiological functions, impairing neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and the structural as well as functional plasticity of brain circuits (Norden et al., 2015; Tay et al., 2017b). Importantly, ensuing neuroinflammation mediated by the activity of microglia, but also astrocytes, is thought to damage the neural tissue and impair synaptic plasticity, critically diminishing cognitive abilities (Lee et al., 2008; Pistell et al., 2010; Davydow et al., 2013; Di Filippo et al., 2013). Thus, in susceptible individuals, an exacerbated inflammatory response of primed microglia to SARS-CoV-2 infection may underlie the onset of disease pathology, including that of psychiatric disorders or neurodegenerative diseases (Norden et al., 2015; Tay et al., 2017b). Furthermore, cerebrovascular events in COVID-19 patients are most prevalent in aging (Ellul et al., 2020; Iadecola et al., 2020), and dysfunctional microglial activity is elevated in older compared to younger individuals (see section “Neurodegenerative Diseases”). Therefore, while hypoxic injuries in COVID-19 patients may be a result of previous chronic conditions, we hypothesize that an already pathological central immune regulation will be further affected by hypoxia-induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to exacerbated injury, possibly mediated by primed microglia. As a result, affected individuals would be more at risk to develop neurological symptoms during COVID-19 (Marshall, 2020).",
            "Microglial PRR signaling is fundamental to the antiviral IFN response in the brain, particularly at early time points after infection (see section “Putative Responses of Microglia to SARS-CoV-2 CNS Infection”) (Nakagaki et al., 2005; Wheeler et al., 2018; Mangale et al., 2020). IFNs can induce a pro-inflammatory phenotype in microglia, and elevate complement-mediated synaptic pruning in mouse models of AD, the most common cause of dementia worldwide (Hong et al., 2016; Naughton et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2020). Analysis of human AD post-mortem tissue found that plaque-associated IBA1-positive microglia were also immunopositive for the interferon induced transmembrane protein 3 and AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, in line with an IFN pathway activation in AD (Roy et al., 2020). RNA-seq analysis of human AD post-mortem brains also showed a robust correlation between IFN and complement pathways (Roy et al., 2020). A similar phenomenon may occur with SARS-CoV-2 infection, where a viral-induced increase in IFN could lead to increased complement-mediated loss of synapses, resulting in memory or cognitive deficits, across psychiatric, aging, and neurodegenerative conditions.",
            "At the same time, as previously mentioned, NLRP3 inflammasome activation is one of the hallmarks of COVID-19 (Freeman and Swartz, 2020; van den Berg and te Velde, 2020). In humans and mice, the NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in AD (Tejera et al., 2019). In mice expressing a human mutation associated with AD, NLRP3 knockout led to enhanced amyloid phagocytosis by microglia, and induced the mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory factors in these cells, including Arginase 1 and Il4 (Heneka et al., 2013). In the same AD model, NLRP3-knockout also prevented microglial morphological changes after a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, according to in vivo two-photon scanning imaging of the somatosensory system (Tejera et al., 2019). Furthermore, in murine models of tauopathy, NLRP3 accounts for the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, another important component of AD pathology (Ising et al., 2019). Therefore, the increased activation of this complex and the subsequent production of pro-inflammatory factors may induce or worsen neurodegenerative pathology in COVID-19 (Heneka et al., 2020). In addition, in a SARS-CoV-2 infected individual, TREM2 was found to be increased in CSF (Pilotto et al., 2020b). According to human genome-wide association studies, TREM2 variants in microglia are associated with increased risk for AD (Guerreiro et al., 2013) and TREM2 CSF levels strongly associate with CSF levels of tau and phosphorylated tau, important biomarkers for AD (Cruchaga et al., 2013). These findings emphasize the risk for neurodegeneration and correspondent cognitive decline in COVID-19 patients (Heneka et al., 2020).",
            "Parkinson’s disease is often associated with the accumulation of misfolded synuclein alpha leading to a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (Lecours et al., 2018). Although there is not yet a reported association with SARS-CoV-2 and parkinsonism, other viruses are associated with a transient form or an increase in the risk of developing PD, partially through microglial reactivity, phagocytosis, and release of pro-inflammatory factors (Sulzer et al., 2020). For example, mouse intranasal infection by influenza viruses (both invading and not invading the CNS) led to an increase in IBA1-positive microglia in the substantia nigra, associated either with neuronal transient loss of function or death (Jang et al., 2009; Sadasivan et al., 2015; Tulisiak et al., 2019; Sulzer et al., 2020). Furthermore, during COVID-19, the cytokine storm and the increased AT1R microglial activity may enhance their release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CNS (Murta et al., 2020), which may exacerbate protein misfolding and aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and induce a deficiency in autophagy in the brain of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (Lippi et al., 2020; Sulzer et al., 2020). This, in turn, may accelerate the development of neurodegenerative disorders, such as PD and AD.",
            "This risk is particularly relevant in older individuals, who have the most severe course of COVID-19, worst post-infection outcomes, and highest mortality rates (Ruan et al., 2020). Importantly, higher ACE2 expression in ECs was found in COVID-19 cases with a history of dementia and hypertension, characterized also by worse outcomes of the infection (Buzhdygan et al., 2020). Indeed, although still understudied, neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are currently shown to be more common in aged patients, along with those with chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) or more severe infections (Mao et al., 2020). Notably, older age is associated with a so-called “inflammaging” phenomenon; an overall decline in immune system efficiency, marked by an elevation of inflammatory markers both in the periphery and CNS (Hammond et al., 2019; Domingues et al., 2020). Older individuals also often display increased numbers of microglia with dystrophic (i.e., smaller cell bodies, seemingly fragmented and tortuous or beaded processes) and reactive morphologies (Streit et al., 2004; Sierra et al., 2007), with the latter partly supporting the concept of microglial priming (Bilbo and Tsang, 2010; Norden et al., 2015; Niraula et al., 2017). Of note, while senescent microglia are frequently used as a synonym for a dystrophic phenotype; it is yet unclear whether this association is valid (Angelova and Brown, 2019). Function-wise, microglia in aged organisms are less motile and less capable of mediating debris clearance (Hefendehl et al., 2014; Safaiyan et al., 2016; Flowers et al., 2017; Marschallinger et al., 2020). When exposed to a challenge, e.g., LPS or laser-induced focal injury, aged microglia, despite being slow to react, can generate an excessive inflammatory response (Sierra et al., 2007; Frank et al., 2010; Damani et al., 2011; Hefendehl et al., 2014; Tejera et al., 2019). For instance, the slower response of aged mouse microglia to a laser-induced focal injury, in the retina and cerebral cortex, was suggested to prevent tissue restoration and contribute to chronic local neuroinflammation (Damani et al., 2011; Hefendehl et al., 2014). After SARS-CoV-2 infection, a dysfunctional response of aged microglia, likely exacerbated by the cytokine storm and hypoxia, may underlie the accelerated cognitive decline observed in aged patients (who did not previously display altered cognition) after a single episode of pneumonia (Shah et al., 2013), a clinical complication that is frequently reported for COVID-19. The molecular basis of this effect could be related to axonal degeneration and myelin loss which were both observed in association with COVID-19 (Handa et al., 2020; Reichard et al., 2020).",
            "Taken together, there is some evidence that microglia are altered upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yet, given COVID-19’s novelty, the roles of microglia in the pathogenesis of the disease, particularly in its neurological consequences, are still elusive. Evidence from other viral infections (whether neurotropic or not) points to a potential microglial role in the loss of taste/scent, encephalopathy, cerebrovascular disease, epilepsy, neurodegeneration, and neuropsychiatric concerns (see section “Microglia Respond to Psychosocial Stress”). Furthermore, pre-existing chronic conditions and advanced age may also alter microglia in a way that biases them toward a deleterious contribution to the neurological symptoms. Future work will be essential to clarify the mechanisms underlying the role of microglia in COVID-19’s pathogenesis in the CNS.",
            "On top of the putative neurological burden imposed on infected individuals, the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased psychological stress, among both the infected and non-infected populations (Kempuraj et al., 2020; Park et al., 2020). Psychosocial stress is a state of mental, emotional, or physiological strain that results from demanding life circumstances, and persistent maladaptive stress responses are related to various disease conditions including mental health disorders (Tian et al., 2017). To investigate the degree of perceived stress during the pandemic, studies have mainly used self-reporting surveys (Brooks et al., 2020; Ellis et al., 2020). For example, in the United States, electronic health records of 62,354 patients with COVID-19 revealed a significant increase in the prevalence of first diagnosis or relapses of anxiety disorders, insomnia, and dementia, in the 14–90 days following SARS-CoV-2 detection, compared to other health perturbations, such as respiratory and viral infections (Taquet et al., 2020). At the same time, although the percentage of affected individuals varies between reports, survivors of SARS-CoV-1 infection can exhibit impaired memory, sleep disturbance, increased levels of stress, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms up to 8 years after infection (Wu et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2007; Hong et al., 2009; Lam et al., 2009; Moldofsky and Patcai, 2011). Therefore, psychiatric long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection are also expected.",
            "In the non-infected population, the COVID-19 pandemic imposes a considerable situational stress (Troyer et al., 2020). Fear of being infected, or dying, and uncertainty of the future all contribute to the psychological distress lived by the population (Li et al., 2020b; Mazza et al., 2020; Satici et al., 2020). Social isolation resulting from social distancing and quarantine, changes in lifestyle including sleep, economic recession, financial loss, as well as boredom, misinformation, and overexposure to media coverage of the pandemic can further contribute to this burden (Brooks et al., 2020; Garfin et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Thakur and Jain, 2020). These circumstances along with several others, such as student status, poor self-rated health, higher perceived stress load, worry about family, friends, and other acquaintances suspected of COVID-19, together with less family support, were all associated with an increased risk of developing depressive or anxious symptoms during the pandemic (Vindegaard and Benros, 2020). Accordingly, these stress-contributing circumstances were shown to exacerbate stress-related disorders (Horesh and Brown, 2020) in previous health and economic crises, potentially leading to clinical depression, psychosis, and suicidal tendencies (Chan et al., 2006; Rhodes et al., 2010; Pfefferbaum et al., 2012; Ng et al., 2013).",
            "Certain populations are likely to experience worsened consequences of stressor exposure (Holmes et al., 2020). Susceptible populations include (i) older adults with multiple co-morbidities, (ii) stay-at-home children and women that suffer domestic violence or maltreatment, (iii) people with pre-existing mental health issues or learning difficulties, (iv) health-care workers, as well as (vi) groups struggling socio-economically (Holmes et al., 2020). Regrettably, only a few COVID-19 surveys have yet looked at the non-infected vulnerable groups, such as people with pre-existing mental health conditions. In patients with eating disorders, the symptomatology worsened in 37.5% of responders, whilst 56.2% reported additional anxiety (Fernández-Aranda et al., 2020). In a psychiatric hospital in China, 2,065 outpatients further reported a prevalence of 25.5% anxiety, 16.9% depression, and 26.6% insomnia symptoms, with 20.9% of patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders presenting a deterioration of their overall mental health state (Zhou et al., 2020). Regarding health-care workers, the majority of papers reveal their increased anxiety, as well as depressive and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms (Vindegaard and Benros, 2020) [although longitudinal studies are currently lacking in general].",
            "As stress is a prominent risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders (Bordeleau et al., 2019; Comer et al., 2020), stress loads also need to be investigated in children living during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a survey of 1,054 Canadian adolescents, results indicated increased levels of concern on schooling and peer-relationship while feeling more loneliness and depressive emotions, especially for individuals engaging in longer virtual meetings with friends (Ellis et al., 2020). Although necessary for reducing the spread of the disease, by limiting contact between people, such as between aid specialists and affected populations, there may be reduced access to resources that could alleviate their stress. It is also important to consider children with mood disorders, which can be exacerbated by the pandemic, as well as children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) whose lifestyle is disrupted by the change of habits and familiar structures during the pandemic (Jefsen et al., 2020). Overall, children in confinement are subject to reduced physical activity, irregular sleep pattern, and less favorable diets (Carroll et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020c), which along with their fear-induced chronic stress, loneliness, and viral infection (possibly from COVID-19), represent strong risk factors for developing ASD, ADHD, psychosis, depression, or schizophrenia (Sormunen et al., 2017; Bordeleau et al., 2019; Reeve et al., 2019; Comer et al., 2020). Another risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders not mentioned yet consists of low family income (Carlsson et al., 2020) for which the number most likely went up during the pandemic with massive job losses (Blustein et al., 2020); together with significant market and bank set-back (Goodell, 2020).",
            "More studies are available looking at mental health distress in the general population. In an online survey that assessed the levels of psychological impact and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, the responses of 1,210 subjects showed that 8.1, 28.8, and 16.5% had moderate to severe stress levels, or anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively (Wang et al., 2020a). The overall mean Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) score for respondents also indicated the presence of PTSD symptoms (Wang et al., 2020a). In another study with 1,041 Irish respondents, 17.67% met PTSD diagnostic requirements during the lockdown, similar to what the same group found in a parallel study for the United Kingdom (16.79%) (Karatzias et al., 2020). In a large population-based survey conducted in China with almost 53,000 respondents, ∼35% experienced psychological distress (Qiu et al., 2020). Analysis of Weibo (a leading Chinese online social network) posts, based on the approach of Online Ecological Recognition, from almost 18,000 active users, also determined that negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, and indignation, increased during the pandemic, while positive emotions, like happiness and life satisfaction, significantly decreased (Li et al., 2020a). Moreover, in a Danish study with 2,458 respondents, the World Health Organization Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) (a psychometrically valid measure of psychological well-being experienced over the past 2 weeks), yielded significantly lower scores during the pandemic compared to results obtained in 2016 (Sønderskov et al., 2020). Likewise, the proportion of respondents for whom assessment for depression should be sought increased compared to the previous survey in 2016 (Sønderskov et al., 2020). Considering the widespread impact of the pandemic, we highlight the need for longitudinal studies investigating stress levels in other cohorts, such as in developing countries or established vulnerable groups, which would allow for a more accurate understanding of stress levels worldwide. In addition, considering the inter-individual response to stress, it would be very important to include additional measures of resilience or vulnerability in these studies.",
            "It is well established that psychological stress increases the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, peripherally and throughout numerous brain regions implicated in stress-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (Vecchiarelli et al., 2016a; Wohleb and Delpech, 2017; Johnson et al., 2019). Whether it is acute or chronic, stress triggers the sympathetic nervous system, and HPA axis activity, to release catecholamine and glucocorticoids, respectively, from the adrenal glands (Sapolsky et al., 2000). Microglia generally respond to elevated glucocorticoids, cytokines, and catecholamines by altering their density, changing their morphology, and producing pro-inflammatory molecules, i.e., reactivity (Figure 1; Tian et al., 2017). These changes have been linked to the effects of acute stress on the motivational state and cognitive function of the organism, but also to the neurological consequences of prolonged exposure to stress, including atrophy of neuronal dendrites, synaptic loss, and glutamate excitotoxicity (Frank et al., 2019). In line with this, the stress response of microglia is implicated in the pathogenesis of (i) neurodevelopmental conditions, such as ASD and ADHD (Bordeleau et al., 2019), (ii) neuropsychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and PTSD (Dantzer et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2009; Haroon et al., 2012; Maes et al., 2012; Leonard, 2014), as well as (iii) neurodegenerative diseases, for instance, AD (Bisht et al., 2018) and PD (Lecours et al., 2018).",
            "During critical periods of brain development, exposure to environmental factors (e.g., psychosocial stress) or genetic vulnerabilities, can trigger the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders (Chaste and Leboyer, 2012; Karmiloff-Smith et al., 2012; Wallace, 2016; Carlsson et al., 2020). Correspondingly, rodent models of prenatal maternal stress, induced by sleep deprivation, exposure to bright light, injection of LPS, or of the viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), produce offspring that have elevated levels of pro-inflammatory markers, as well as impaired microglial density, maturation, and distribution in the postnatal brain, ultimately affecting neurogenesis, synaptic pruning, and brain functional connectivity (Bordeleau et al., 2019). Glucocorticoids and DAMPs released by cellular stress also prime the pro-inflammatory response of microglia ex vivo and in vivo (Frank et al., 2019). Primed microglia display an increased expression of genes related to phagocytosis, cellular proliferation, and vesicular release, leading to an exacerbated inflammatory response upon exposure to a subsequent challenge. Priming may also occur following acute peripheral inflammation and the increase of circulating cytokines during COVID-19 (see section “Microglia Respond to the Systemic Inflammatory Response in COVID-19”). This could be particularly relevant for children and adolescents infected by SARS-CoV-2 which, despite presumed lower vulnerability to COVID-19 (Lee et al., 2020), are at a critical moment of brain maturation. The same holds for fetuses in pregnant people infected by the virus. A disrupted physiological microglial function may partially explain why maternal stress, and childhood maltreatment, including physical or emotional neglect, are major risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders and adult psychiatric conditions later in life, such as MDD, PTSD, and GAD (Tay et al., 2017a). Accordingly, impairment of microglial support during critical windows of brain development due to psychosocial stress suggests that infants, children, and adolescents are likely to experience worse neurodevelopmental effects during and after the pandemic (Holmes et al., 2020), possibly potentiated by concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infection (see section “Microglial-Mediated CNS Inflammation may Contribute to the COVID-19 Associated Neurological Manifestations”).",
            "Psychosocial stress during adulthood does not only increase the risk for MDD and PTSD, but also accelerates cognitive aging, as well as AD and PD progression (Schneiderman et al., 2005; Farrell et al., 2017; Tay et al., 2017a; Benson et al., 2018; Barrero-Castillero et al., 2019; Lähdepuro et al., 2019). Correspondingly, initial reports indicate increased incidence of MDD, anxiety, and PTSD in the general population during the pandemic (Karatzias et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a; Sønderskov et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a). In adult rodents, chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and social defeat stress models were shown to induce significant increases in microglial density and morphological alterations within areas associated with the stress response and emotion processing (Figure 1; Tynan et al., 2010; Wohleb et al., 2011, 2013; Kopp et al., 2013; Lehmann et al., 2016; Tay et al., 2017a; Nie et al., 2018), although there are many contradictory reports (Tay et al., 2017a). Similar microglial changes were also reported in humans, with post-mortem brains presenting increased microglial density, morphological transformation, and expression of translocator protein 18 kDa (TPSO), which is up-regulated in reactive microglia and astrocytes, across patients with ASD, schizophrenia, MDD, and bipolar disorder (Tay et al., 2017a). Increased IBA1-positive or HLA-DR-positive microglial immunostaining was also encountered in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus of people who have died by suicide (Steiner et al., 2008; Torres-Platas et al., 2014).",
            "The stress-induced increased microglial density and reactivity may account for exacerbated oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and pathological synaptic remodeling, which are together associated with the development of mental health disorders (Zhao et al., 2015; Milior et al., 2016). For instance, in mice, CUS has been shown to increase the number of phagocytic inclusions containing neuronal elements per IBA1-positive microglial process (Wohleb et al., 2011, 2013), which is suggestive of augmented synaptic pruning. Considering that synaptic loss is the best pathological correlate of cognitive decline in MDD, schizophrenia, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases (Terry et al., 1991; Tay et al., 2017a), modulating the synaptic remodeling executed by microglia in response to stress could allow to mitigate the detrimental effects of psychosocial stress. To do so, one alternative could be to target fractalkine signaling between neurons and microglia, via CX3CR1, since several works suggest that CX3CR1-deficient mice are resistant to the deleterious effects of chronic stress exposure (Tay et al., 2017a). Specifically, in adult mice, CX3CR1-deficiency prevented the effects of CUS on neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus CA1 region, as well as the emergence of depressive-like behavior (Milior et al., 2016). These mice were also found to be resistant to stress-induced microglial hyper-ramification in the dentate gyrus, and depression-like behavior under the forced swim paradigm (Hellwig et al., 2016). Of note, disrupting this pathway appears detrimental during pre- and postnatal development (Paolicelli et al., 2011; Squarzoni et al., 2014; Zhan et al., 2014), and during viral and hypoxic injuries (see sections “Putative Responses of Microglia to SARS-CoV-2 CNS Infection” and “Microglia Respond to COVID-19-Associated Hypoxia”), thus, more research is necessary to determine the feasibility of this approach.",
            "Stress resulting from the pandemic (and viral infection) could also enhance the activity or development of microglia associated with higher synaptic pruning activity, for instance, “dark microglia,” which could be targeted specifically (Bisht et al., 2016; El Hajj et al., 2019; Savage et al., 2020; St-Pierre et al., 2020). There are also stress-induced microglial-mediated changes in neurotransmitter synthesis, altogether allowing for a neural environment where neuroinflammation and alterations in neuronal activity contribute to the development of mental health diseases. In response to inflammatory stimuli or stress, in microglia, the tryptophan metabolite kynurenine [from the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway] is used to form quinolinic acid, a glutamate ionotropic receptor agonist [N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)] (Capuron et al., 2002; Schwarcz et al., 2012; Vecchiarelli et al., 2016b). Remarkably, there is an increase in the expression of genes involved in tryptophan metabolism with COVID-19 (Gardinassi et al., 2020), which could lead to glutamate excitotoxicity and divert tryptophan away from serotonin synthesis toward kynurenine metabolism (Capuron et al., 2002; Schwarcz et al., 2012; Vecchiarelli et al., 2016b), associated with anxiety, mood disorders, psychosis, and cognitive decline. This is likely contributed to by the systemic inflammation associated with COVID-19.",
            "The effects of stress on microglia depend on the type, duration, and frequency of the exposure (Yirmiya and Goshen, 2011; Calcia et al., 2016). The myriad of psychosocial stressors during the pandemic will likely have diverse effects on microglia, but we hypothesize that vulnerable groups carrying an already primed immune response, for instance, due to aging, chronic disease, or a history of mental distress, will experience more pro-inflammatory outcomes, in turn, resulting in an increased risk for psychiatric disorders. We highlight the potential threat of a global mental health crisis affecting these populations and the urgent need for policies that provide targeted care, including access to the COVID-19 vaccine.",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic possibly affects the CNS through viral infection, hypoxic-injuries, and increased cytokine circulation in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, but also by psychosocial stress, in both non-infected and infected populations. Microglia, crucial to physiological and immune functions of the brain, respond to these insults in diverse ways. In a model of murine coronavirus infection (JMHV), ablation of these cells with CSFR1 inhibition promoted deleterious outcomes, including increased animal mortality, viral replication, T cell infiltration, and demyelination (Mangale et al., 2020). Microglial depletion also exacerbates stroke-injury and reduces neurogenesis (Lalancette-Hébert et al., 2007; Szalay et al., 2016). This indicates, at least in some models of CNS viral infection and CNS injury, that microglia (amongst other cells) serve a protective role, and that their reduced presence allows for even more deleterious effects. However, in the context of a cytokine storm or after exposure to chronic psychosocial stress, microglia can become altered in their function and then increase the release of inflammatory mediators, generating pathogenic effects associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions. These combined findings highlight a need to understand how microglia (and their different subtypes) may switch temporally from contextually beneficial states to harmful ones. This knowledge would be valuable to mitigate harmful CNS outcomes of COVID-19 pandemic, and possibly its long-term consequences on neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative conditions. Alternatively, although this awaits further research, in critical groups, for instance, aged individuals or cohorts with pre-existing conditions, modulating the pro-inflammatory activity of microglia upon SARS-CoV-2 detection, via minocycline (Oliveira et al., 2020), for example, may help avoid unwanted neurological outcomes. The same holds for individuals with a history of mental health disorders, for which the reduction of dysfunctional microglial synaptic remodeling may prevent the worsening of mental distress associated with the pandemic.",

            "COVID-19 impacted the entire world’s population, frequently resulting in long-lasting neuropsychiatric complications. Furthermore, social distancing, lockdowns and fear for one’s personal health worsen individual psychological wellbeing, especially in children and adolescents. Herein, we discuss the results of studies that specifically reported data about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or infection on children with Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Disorders (PANS). Furthermore, we present the cases of five adolescents with PANS whose symptomatology increased following SARS-CoV-2 infection. What emerged from this study was that COVID-19 resulted in the exacerbation of obsessions, tics, anxiety and mood symptoms and decreased wellbeing. Moreover, new symptoms, as well as new PANS cases, are reported to have arisen after COVID-19 infection. Here, we hypothesize that the pathogenic mechanisms of silent viruses, such as the Epstein–Barr virus, are related to neuroinflammation, immune responses and reactivation, with additional roles played by social-isolation-related inflammatory processes. The discussion of PANS, which represents a model of immune-mediated neuropsychiatric manifestations, is particularly relevant, with the aim of uncovering the mechanisms that lead to neuropsychiatric Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS). Prospects for future studies and treatment implications are discussed.",
            "At the time that this review was written, more than 600 million people had been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The effects of COVID-19 spread through the entire human body [1], including the brain, resulting in neurological and psychiatric symptoms [2,3]. In a large multicentric international study, 80% of hospitalized COVID survivors reported neurologic symptoms [4]. Among these neurological and neuropsychiatric abnormalities, the most common are headache, confusion, memory difficulties, anosmia, hypogeusia, anxiety symptoms, Guillain–Barre syndrome, encephalitis, seizures and cerebrovascular stroke [5,6,7].",
            "Furthermore, neuropsychiatric symptoms persist after infection and, in some cases, appear weeks later. A total of 37% of post-COVID patients experiences fatigue, 33% experience brain fog, and around 20–30% experience anxiety or depressive symptoms [8]. This condition has been named Neuropsychiatric Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PANS) [9].",
            "The effects of respiratory infections on psychiatric disorders are well-known. Indeed, as seen in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) survivors, SARS infection is associated with an increased risk of developing a psychiatric morbidity [10]. Indeed, more than 40% of SARS survivors experienced at least one psychiatric disorder in a 4-year follow-up, with the most common types being post-traumatic stress disorders (54.5%), depression (39%), somatoform pain disorder (36.4%), panic disorder (32.5%) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) (15.6%) [10].",
            "COVID-19 impacts not only the lives of infected individuals but also those of the uninfected. Indeed, quarantine and social isolation decreased wellbeing and negatively affected people’s mental health [11,12]. An online survey showed that 60% of respondents reported the onset of OCD symptoms during the pandemic, with an increased likelihood of presenting with generalized anxiety disorder and depression [13]. A large international survey study reported that most OCD patients perceived a worsening of their symptoms during the pandemic [14]. This worsening was associated with an increased demand for psychological and pharmacological therapies. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic particularly impacted the mental health of children and adolescents [15]. Indeed, the psychological state of almost 80% of children was negatively affected by the pandemic and quarantine [16]. Acute COVID-19 infection resulted in long-term clinical consequences in children [17], and the symptomatology of children with comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders was also further exacerbated by COVID-19 infection. Autoimmunity and inflammation are regarded as potential pathogenic mechanisms of the worsening or new onset of symptoms following COVID-19 infection and the pandemic [3,18,19]. Considering the overall impact of COVID-19 on neuropsychiatric symptomatology in children and its potential autoimmunological explanation, Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders (PANS) represent an optimal model of immune-mediated neuropsychiatric manifestations. Therefore, a discussion of the potential relationship between PANS and COVID-19 and its potential mechanism of alteration is needed.",
            "In this review, we discuss the results of studies that specifically reported associations between the COVID-19 pandemic or infection and children with Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Disorders (PANS), with a focus on the involvement of the Epstein–Barr virus. Furthermore, we report on the cases of five adolescents whose symptomatology was aggravated following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we aimed to explore the potential implications of the common pathogenic mechanisms.",
            "Among children, the pandemic and related-social isolation have been associated with the onset of anxiety–depressive symptoms and stress [20]. Specifically, it was reported that in the first year of the pandemic, one of four youths showed more severe depression symptoms, while one of five youths showed more anxiety symptoms [21]. Moreover, children and adolescents experienced increased inattention and irritability and became more dependent on their caregivers [15,22]. In the clinical population, an exacerbation of the frequency of contamination obsessions and cleaning/washing compulsions was observed in children with OCD, with more than one-third of the subjects showing an increase of at least 30% in their total CY-BOCS [23], as well as increased anxiety and depressive symptoms [24]. The latter result was confirmed by an observational longitudinal study of children and adolescents with psychiatric or neurological disorders, who showed a worsening of anxiety and obsessive symptoms [25]. Risk factors more commonly related to the onset of symptoms during the lockdown have been observed to be related to parental stress, fear of contagion, changes in daily routine and social isolation [22,26,27].",
            "Concerning the neuropsychiatric effects of infection on children, an Italian study showed that 66% of patients continued to have symptoms for at least 2 months after COVID-19 [28]. The most prevalent symptoms were fatigue (16,2%) and lack of concentration (11.8%). A meta-analysis [17] then reported the occurrence of Long COVID in children after 12 weeks post-infection with a prevalence of more than 25%, with mood symptoms and fatigue among the most common symptoms. Savino et al. [29] reported five pediatric cases of the onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms following COVID-19 infection. The immune hypothesis is still considered as a potential cause. Several autoimmune diseases and autoinflammatory conditions, such as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS), Kawasaki disease and encephalitis in children [30], develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Savino et al. [29] found that in one case, the onset of tics following COVID-19 in a child was associated with increased CRP and ASR and antistreptolysin titers, while another case was associated with increased lymphocytes and red blood cells, supporting the neuroinflammatory hypothesis.",
            "In 1998, Swedo [31] reported the first description of 50 cases of children who experienced the abrupt onset of OCD or tic disorder symptoms following Group A Streptococcus infection. Swedo coined the term PANDAS, which denotes Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections. Over time, clinicians observed that many episodes of PANDAS symptoms appeared to be triggered by non-Group-A Streptococcal infections. Consequently, new diagnostic criteria were developed to describe PANS, or Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Disorders [32]. These new criteria (see Table 1) established other factors beyond streptococcal infections as triggering events, including non-infectious triggers, such as environmental factors and metabolic disorders.",
            "While a specific infectious pathogen (streptococcus) is responsible for PANDAS, different microbes may possibly be implicated in the genesis of PANS, such as H1N1 influenza, Epstein–Barr virus and Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme) disease [33,34,35,36]. Furthermore, PANS is also presumed to be caused by a variety of disease mechanisms with multiple etiologies, such as neuroinflammatory, toxic, environmental, metabolic or endocrine disorders, via the triggering of autoimmune responses [37,38,39,40].",
            "Concerning the PANS phenotype, in a characterization study conducted by Murphy et al. [41] anxiety, emotional lability and low quality of life emerged as key symptoms of all PANS patients. Other peculiarities instead emerged to be specific to only of some pf the patients, and this led to the definition of three clusters of PANS symptoms. PANS youths with elevated streptococcal antibody titers were more likely to have more severe OCD compared to youths without elevated titers. Cluster 1, operationally defined as “core characteristic PANS symptoms”, included five symptoms that were predominantly consistent with the hallmark symptoms of PANS (e.g., emotional lability, anxiety symptoms, sleep disturbances, deterioration in school and behavioral regression). Cluster 2 was defined as “streptococcal-related symptoms” and included eight symptoms that predominantly consisted of symptoms previously described as being associated with GAS infection (e.g., urinary symptoms, ADHD, handwriting deterioration) [41], as well as sensory problems and simple tics. Cluster 3 predominantly included symptoms such as food restriction, mydriasis, fatigue, gastrointestinal problems and depressive symptoms, which are all cytokine-related behavioral symptoms [42]. Therefore, cluster 3 was operationally defined as “cytokine-driven/physiological symptoms.” Moreover, patients with symptoms in cluster 3 exhibited elevated mycoplasma, hallucinations and/or psychotic symptoms, as well as complex tics.",
            "The OCD and tic symptoms of PANDAS are hypothesized to result from either an autoimmune or inflammatory disruption of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits. Studies have shown structural and functional neuroimaging abnormalities in the basal ganglia [43]. Antibodies isolated from children with PANDAS, compared with control subjects, selectively recognize a subtype of neuron in the basal ganglia of postmortem human brains [44]. A thorough analysis of the literature revealed elevated cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6) in OCD [45] and PANS patients [46]. Moreover, the volume of the basal ganglia has been shown to be increased in PANDAS patients compared to controls, and increased activation of the microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells, was observed in PANDAS subjects who were compared to those with Tourette’s syndrome [43]. Moreover, further evidence for the autoimmunity of PANDAS was provided by the discovery of serum and CSF reactions to postmortem human caudate and putamen tissues [43].",
            "Family histories of PANS patients revealed a high incidence of autoimmune disorders (80%) [47]. PANS patients also frequently demonstrate coexisting autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases, most commonly inflammatory back pain (21%) and reactive or persistent arthritis (28%) [48].",
            "As stated above, PANS refers to the acute presentation of neuropsychiatric syndrome in children, including OCD. OCD symptoms in adults and children have worsened as an effect of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as have anxiety and depression symptoms [14]. However, few studies have investigated the possible relationships between PANS/PANDAS and COVID-19 (see Table 2). The relationship between PANS and COVID-19 should be addressed for at least two reasons. First, considering the impacts of the pandemic and direct infection on the mental health of children, as previously reported, children with PANS may have also been considerably affected by this virus. Therefore, this is a first clinical reason. The second is more mechanistic. In fact, in light of the autoimmunity hypothesis of neuropsychiatric complications following COVID-19 infection and the autoimmune origin of PANS, PANS represents a special case to be studied, since it is a model of immune-mediated neuropsychiatric manifestations which could help, in this case, to uncover the mysteries of neuropsychiatric PACS complications.",
            "In two survey studies [49,50], researchers asked caregivers of children and adolescents with PANS to complete standardized questionnaires related to the severity of their children’s symptoms. In both cases, the majority reported that the pandemic negatively impacted their children’s relationships with others, academic performance and wellbeing. These findings are consistent with other parental reports of reduced psychological well-being in children during the pandemic [53]. Patients with PANS/PANDAS syndrome showed an increase in symptoms during the lockdown in 71% of the sample, and the onset of new symptoms was observed in almost one third of the sample [50], being correlated with the presence of sleep disturbances, anxiety and the effects of pandemic stress, such as fear of contracting the virus. Interestingly, 29% of the children showed the onset of new symptoms such as irritability, fears and generalized anxiety [50].",
            "O’Dor and colleagues [49] also reported changes in symptoms in a subgroup of patients who were infected with the coronavirus (12 patients). Their parents were asked to indicate what new or exacerbated symptoms their children exhibited during the course of the illness. The most commonly exacerbated symptom after confirmed COVID-19 infection was mood lability (58.33% of cases), followed by OCD, tics and sensory symptoms. This is important, given the hypothesis that additional infections may trigger symptoms of PANS/PANDAS [31].",
            "COVID-19 infection can not only result in an exacerbation of the condition of children already affected by PANS but can also eventually trigger new-onset PANS. Indeed, two independent case series each reported two cases of young adolescents showing a temporal correlation between COVID-19 infection and PANSs onset [51,52]. In Efe [51], after asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, two sisters showed an abrupt onset of restricted foot intake two weeks after infection. During the active phase of the infection, they were both socially isolated for two weeks. Pavone et al. [52] reported the cases of two unrelated children diagnosed with PANS following the abrupt onset of PANS-related symptoms 2 weeks after a positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab. The first child showed restricted food intake and OCD symptoms. The second experienced OCD symptoms and tic onset.",
            "The temporal association between the emergence of new cases of PANS and infection with SARS-Cov-2 may suggest a causative trigger role of COVID-19 in the development of central nervous system autoimmunity.",
            "It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 can also result in long-lasting symptoms related to cognitive functions. Indeed, a lack of concentration, for example, has been shown to be one of the most prevalent PACS symptoms in both adults and children [28,54]. No study has directly evaluated the impact of COVID-19 infection on PANS patients’ cognition. However, considering the findings showing alterations following infection in other pediatric samples, new studies should investigate this potential effect.",
            "As reported previously, PANDAS reflects the selective involvement of cortico-striatal networks. Thus, patients with PANDAS may exhibit distinct neuropsychological profiles of vulnerability within cognitive, affective or behavioral domains [55,56,57]. Specifically, weakness in aspects of executive function related to cognitive efficiency may follow the disruption of basal ganglia networks, including inattention, cognitive slowing (slow processing speed), reduced verbal initiation, difficulties with set-shifting, disinhibition and a reduced working memory.",
            "Patients with PANDAS had greater difficulty in sustaining attention, inhibiting responses to stimuli and quickly integrating and acting upon new information (i.e., they exhibited a slower processing speed) [58]. PACS patients showed executive function alterations post-COVID-19 [59], including alterations in attention [54]. In line with this finding, in the case reports of new-onset PANS following COVID-19, attention-deficit and decreased academic performance were observed [51,52].",
            "Interestingly, alterations in cortico-striato-thalamo circuits in COVID-19 patients have also been related to cognitive symptoms [60]. Moreover, we found an association between executive function alterations and inflammatory markers in post-COVID-19 subjects (IL-6, fibrinogen). Given that PANS is characterized by the disruption of the striatal circuits and high levels of cytokines, including IL-6, the potential effects of SARS-CoV-2 in worsening inflammation and inducing immune responses should also be investigated in regard to the potential impacts of cognitive functions, considering that one of the main symptoms of COVID-19 is brain fog.",
            "Approximately 25% of caregivers of sampled PANS patients reported at the time of the study that they had no plans to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 [49]. This percentage is similar (28–33%) to those based on parental reports of vaccination refusal in other clinical populations [61]. Reluctance to vaccinate among PANDAS patients could also be due to the idea that people with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases might experience a worsening of their symptoms as a result of vaccination. An observational study comparing more than 1000 people with neuroinflammation diseases and 500 controls found no difference in the frequency of vaccine side effects and no evidence of an impact of vaccination on pre-existing symptoms [62]. However, a rare risk of autoimmune disorder following vaccination was also reported [63,64]. In any case, although rare, cases of neuropsychiatric symptoms following vaccination again highlight the importance of considering and assessing autoimmunity and inflammation markers in children in the COVID-19 age.",
            "To further demonstrate the implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection for patients with PANDAS, here, we report five cases of adolescents admitted to the outpatient neuropsychiatric unit of the Institute of Neuroscience (Florence, Italy) between July and September 2022. The adolescents were previously diagnosed with PANDAS after a streptococcal infection. When they arrived at the institute, they had already been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and experienced (Cases 1 and 5) one month of isolation. All patients showed a worsening of tics and repetitive behaviors two weeks after having a negative PCR result. Moreover, they experienced increased social anxiety and depressive thoughts. The psychometric scale known as the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale was administered and showed a moderate impairment associated with tics. Interestingly, when observing the symptom checklist, higher percentages of both motor and vocal tics were reported as currently presented rather than ever-presented. The patients also complained of a lack of concentration. The Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and the Stop Signal Task showed impairments in attentional and executive functions. The laboratory test results are reported in Table 3.",
            "In these patients, an exacerbation of PANS-related symptomatology occurred after SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was not related to TAS, anti-DNAsi B or streptococcus. In Cases 2–4, a reactivation of EBV was observed, which was associated with an increase in inflammatory markers (IL-6, fibrinogen). EBV could account for the exacerbation of PANDAS. In Cases 1–5, EBV was not reactivated. However, elevated levels of IL-6 were observed in both cases, while elevated fibrinogen and CRP were only observed in Case 1. In these two cases, considering the fact that the patients experienced a longer period of isolation during the active infection phase (one month), social distancing and isolation could have played a role in their complications of PANDAS symptoms. Indeed, inflammatory markers have been correlated with lockdown experiences [65]. Importantly, the exacerbation was not related to a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, regarding the cognitive alterations experienced by these five patients, PACS-related executive function alterations have been correlated with increased IL-6 levels [59], which were above the threshold for all the five of the patients. In the previous case reports described by Efe [51] and Pavone et al. [52], the onset of symptoms was not associated with a reactivation of EBV, although the authors reported an increase in inflammatory markers. Our case series, by showing that two possible mechanisms could account for the clinical picture, allow us to go a step further in our comprehension of the pathogenic mechanisms of PACS. The associations between behavioral reports and immunological findings are in favor of the hypothesis defining autoimmunity and EBV reactivation as potential trigger agents.",
            "The question of how COVID-19 may cause neurological and psychiatric symptoms in affected children is a debated issue. Lin and colleagues [66] advanced the hypothesis that COVID-19 causes an inflammatory and autoimmune response. Indeed, COVID-19 is correlated with aberrant and excessive inflammation [67]. As a result of the immune host’s antiviral response, neuropsychiatric abnormalities in COVID-19 patients have been correlated with greater levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-2, IL-17 and TNF [68]. Peripheral cytokines may cause neuropsychiatric symptoms, even in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infiltration into the CNS. In fact, they can trigger neuroinflammatory reactions and/or compromised blood–brain barrier integrity, which results in the migration of peripheral immune cells into the CNS, activation of the microglia and disruption of neurotransmission [42,68]. In particular, basal ganglia GABAergic transmission has been linked to changes caused by exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines. The hypo-dopaminergic state of the basal ganglia is understood to be caused by other pro-inflammatory mediators, such interferon-alpha, which is believed to be a potential initiating factor for psychiatric disorders [69]. This is particularly relevant to PANS, considering the already disrupted functioning of the basal ganglia [44].",
            "The immunological dyshomeostasis induced by a new virus is another pathophysiological mechanism that may play a role in PACS symptoms. The pathogenesis of long-term COVID-19 has been attributed to abnormal inflammatory responses, persistent SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs in particular tissues that cause post-infection morbidity, the reactivation of pathogens, host microbiome changes and molecular mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 and proteins [70]. SARS-CoV-2 may stimulate an abnormal immune response that results in autoimmunity later on, with secondary nervous system damage in susceptible people (particularly those with allergies or a history of autoimmune illnesses, as occurs in PANS). Prior to the onset of autoimmunity, viral infections may cause an inflammatory environment that supports and encourages the “molecular mimicry” phenomenon by increasing the level of host antibodies or lymphocytes that are cross-reactive with both viral antigens and self-antigens [19]. In line with this, in children with neuropsychiatric onset after COVID-19, increased levels of lymphocytes have frequently been found [29,51]. Considering this evidence, we suppose that the etiology of neuropsychiatric complications in COVID-19 could be multifactorial (Figure 1), as a result of a complex interplay between systemic and brain inflammation and environmental stress in vulnerable individuals.",
            "Concerning the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and PANS, it is necessary to distinguish between the mechanism that leads to the new onset of PANS after COVID-19 infection and the exacerbation of symptoms in PANS patients following infection. In the first case, it can be hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 acts as a causal agent of the new onset of PANS or reactivates EBV, triggering PANS. Indeed, as reported previously, EBV may be the trigger of PANS. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can also result in the activation of other viruses, specifically herpes viruses. For a detailed list of potential triggers, see Table 2. In the second case, the mechanism exposed above could be the cause. Therefore, systemic inflammation in response to SARS-CoV-2 could exacerbate neuropsychiatric symptoms. As COVID-19 triggers systemic inflammation, it may also activate the microglia, lower the levels of monoamines and trophic factors, increase the levels of glutamate and N-methyl-d-aspartate and cause excitotoxicity [71]. Overall, these series of events may cause pre-existing neuropsychiatric problems to worsen [71]. Therefore, the pathogenesis of the concomitant neuropsychiatric symptoms may include neuro-inflammatory pathways [72]. The exacerbation of symptoms may be related to inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 virus that affect PANS symptoms. The immunological profiles of PANS patients have also shown some non-univocal alterations [46]. Pro-inflammatory chemokines, as well as CRP, were significantly elevated in pediatric patients with neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 compared to controls [73]. Moreover, children with COVID-19 and neuropsychiatric complications may respond to immunotherapy. These data highlight the possibility of a CNS–immune-related mechanism in children with COVID-19 who experience neuropsychiatric symptoms [74].",
            "In cases where symptoms persist for months after the acute phase of COVID-19 and after negativization, the reactivation of other viruses, such as EBV, can cause an immune response leading to the persistence of the symptomatology. Indeed, herpes viruses are neutropic and neurovirulent; thus, they can infect nervous cells and produce neuropsychiatric symptoms [75]. Gold et al. [76] found that 66.7% of Long COVID subjects were positive for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) reactivation. Moreover, Klein et al. [77] found that Long COVID individuals had higher titers of anti-EBV antibodies. In these cases, the symptoms did not decrease until the reactivated viruses and the associated immune responses were adopted as the target of the treatment. In accordance with this hypothesis, an observational study showed that in Long COVID patients, the inflammatory profile was correlated with alterations in executive functions, with potential effects of EBV reactivation [59]. Together, these studies make a strong case for the argument that Long COVID chronic inflammation may be due, in part, to a reactivated virus such as EBV. The question of whether this exacerbation of PANS symptoms is due to SARS-CoV-2 with a reactivated herpes virus needs to be considered. This pathogenic mechanism can explain two of the cases reported here.",
            "Additionally, the pandemic’s impact on people who were not physically affected by the virus may be explained, again, by the inflammatory theory. In fact, many people who are subjected to lockdowns and social isolation are affected by loneliness-related raised levels of inflammatory indicators [78,79]. Koyama et al. [79] found that people who were socially isolated and felt lonely had higher NLR. Interestingly, people who were not socially isolated but felt lonely had lower CRP. In the study of Brusaferri and colleagues [65] inflammatory markers such as IL-6 were also shown to be increased after the lockdown in healthy individuals. A metanalysis showed loneliness and social isolation are associated with inflammatory markers such as IL-6, CRP and fibrinogen [80]. In conclusion, being socially isolated and feeling lonely have both been associated with chronic inflammation. As a consequence, neuroimmune activation may be a possible mechanism underlying many of the symptoms experienced by uninfected individuals during the pandemic. This pathogenic mechanism could account for the exacerbation of PANDAS symptoms in the other cases reported here, in which increased levels of IL-6 were observed, together with CRP and fibrinogen alterations.",
            "In conclusion, herein, COVID-related viral infection was considered as a trigger of autoimmune phenomena, together with comorbid autoimmune disorders (PANS), age and one’s surrounding environment. In this sense, the psychological distress caused by the environmental factors that the pandemic forced upon all of us could have worked jointly to worsen the autoimmune phenomena triggered by COVID-19 beyond what occurs in cases of seasonal influenza. This indicates the necessity of uncovering the involved mechanisms and defining new operational clinical interventions.",
            "In this review, we exposed the impact of COVID-19 on children with a previous diagnosis of PANS, as well its potential impact on new-onset PANS. Previous studies showing the effects of COVID-19 on PANS did not expose any potential mechanism of action and did not consider the exacerbation and new onset of PANDAS cases together. They considered only the consequences of the pandemic, without considering the impacts of the illness and the virus on the brain. Conversely, herein, we proposed a potential mechanism involving autoimmunity and EBV reactivation as potential trigger agents. Furthermore, we presented five cases of adolescents with PANDAS whose symptomatology increased following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three cases showed a reactivation of EBV, as well as increased inflammatory markers. In the other two cases, EBV was not reactivated, but the inflammatory panel was altered. Different mechanisms could account for the cases reported, but this question needs to be investigated further. However, what is certain is that it is important for healthcare professionals to be aware that COVID-19 infection has the potential to exacerbate PANS/PANDAS symptoms in this population or even act as a factor triggering new onset in certain cases. The symptoms of PANS/PANDAS may be intensified even in children who have not had COVID-19 because of causes or stresses related to the pandemic. The pandemic may have had a detrimental influence on general social and emotional functioning. Thus, support methods and therapies should be suggested to address these complex problems.",
            "Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has shown clinical efficacy in critical ill patients with COVID-19 [81]. This treatment is also prescribed to PANDAS patients [82], suggesting, again, a potential relationship between the underlying immune profiles of PANS and COVID-19 patients. Moreover, SSRIs, another treatment commonly prescribed to PANDAS patients, could be a protective factor in COVID-19 infections [83]. Therefore, it is also possible that PANDAS patients are protected by their treatments. No studies have addressed this point. We hope that future studies will investigate the neuroinflammatory profiles of PANS patients who have been infected with the coronavirus and will compare the incidence and symptom severity between those who were treated with SSRIs and those treated differently. Again, this highlights that a neuroscience-based approach designed to reduce SARS-CoV-2-related mental health sequelae is needed [3].",

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative movement disorders worldwide. Hence, the influence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 syndrome on PD patients has raised many questions and produced various publications with conflicting results. We reviewed the literature, with respect to symptoms, treatment, and whether the virus itself might cause PD during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in SARS-CoV-2-affected symptomatic PD patients (COVID-19 syndrome). In addition, we comment on the consequences in non-symptomatic and non-affected PD patients, as well as post-COVID syndrome and its potential linkage to PD, presenting our own data from our out-patient clinic.",
            "Over the last two years, the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has swept across the globe, infecting millions of people in every country and causing a global pandemic that was last observed over one hundred years ago. SARS-CoV-2 causes a syndrome called COVID-19, which comprises many major and minor, mostly unspecific, symptoms. Systemic symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, cough, and dyspnea, are the most apparent symptoms at onset, affecting the cardiopulmonary system, and leading to interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome [1]–life-threatening conditions that overwhelm the capacity of intensive care units (ICU). Therefore, treating this disorder and preventing severe manifestations is the major challenge in the fight against the pandemic. Besides these disease manifestations, other acute and subacute symptoms also arise during SARS-CoV-2 infections, including neurological symptoms and syndromes [2], such as encephalopathy [3], meningoencephalitis [4], ischemic stroke [5], acute necrotizing encephalopathy [6], and Guillain–Barré syndrome [7].",
            "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative movement disorders worldwide, which particularly affects older people. Patients at a more advanced age or stage of PD are at an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections, due to their impaired motor functions, comorbidities, frailty, and, hence, increased risk of pneumonia. The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has raised many questions, regarding symptoms, treatment, and outcomes in PD patients. In addition, pathophysiological considerations have raised the question of whether the virus itself can cause PD.",
            "One of the most specific symptoms that occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection is altered smell (hyposmia or dysosmia) and taste (dysgeusia), affecting about 65% of all infected people [8]. Hyposmia is also the most common symptom in presymptomatic PD patients, affecting numerous patients long before they develop motor symptoms [9,10]. This has led to the assumption that there may be a linkage between these two diseases, particularly because neurodegeneration in PD is thought to occur after a pathogenic encounter, e.g., a neurotropic virus, via a nasal or gastric pathway [11]. An overlap can be drawn with the recently published case–control PET study, with the differentiation of PD into the body-first and brain-first subtypes [12]. The authors stated that in the body-first subtype, the pathogen enters the brain via the gut, and the alpha-synuclein pathology spreads from there into the brain. In the brain-first subtype, the pathogen most likely enters the brain via the olfactory bulb, and the alpha-synuclein pathology spreads from there downwards into the body. Entering the brain via non-myelinated nerves, the pathogen most likely triggers chronic neuroinflammation and cytokine production, thus activating microglia [13] (Figure 1). Neuroinflammation can be observed in autopsy studies in PD animal models [14] and, functionally, in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in PD patients [15]. A study from 1992 demonstrated that coronavirus was present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 18 PD patients compared to normal controls and patients with other neurological disorders [16]. SARS-CoV-2 enters and infects cells using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [17]. ACE2 receptors are expressed in neurons and glial cells in many brain regions, as well as in the substantia nigra and the olfactory bulb [18]. A preprint study showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be found in brain tissue in 10 out of 11 performed autopsies, which provides evidence of substantial viral burden [19]. The invading neurons in the olfactory bulb might explain the occurrence of hyposmia, which, unlike in PD, is reversible in COVID-19. Studies showed recurrence of smelling in all patients (n = 46) who reported hyposmia 17 days after the onset of symptoms [20].",
            "In 1917, von Economo described a syndrome called encephalitis lethargica [21,22], which was followed by the so-called ‘Spanish flu’ pandemic in 1918/1919 (caused by the H1N1 influenza virus and occurred in a significantly higher proportion of younger people than older people) [13,23]. Encephalitis lethargica included lethargy, cognitive decline, headache, and sickness; during disease progression, PD-like symptoms, such as bradykinesia, rigor, and the inability to move, also occurred [22,24]. In the 1920s, parkinsonism, due to encephalitis lethargica, was responsible for over 50% of all cases, affecting mostly young people in their third decade. Compared to idiopathic PD, this syndrome showed a coarse tremor, instead of a fine and rhythmic tremor, and more often presented with ocular movement disorders as oculogyric crises [24]. Encephalitis lethargica occurred less frequently during the following decades. Post-encephalitic parkinsonism (PEP) has been described in a few case series for several viruses, including the herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, influenza virus type A, coxsackie virus, poliovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, West Nile virus, and the Japanese encephalitis B virus [25,26]. In patients who developed PEP, an improvement in motor symptoms was observed after levodopa treatment, in the few cases administered this treatment [25,27,28,29]. Although the improvement in motor symptoms was good at the beginning, these patients also developed dyskinesia after prolonged treatment [30,31]. In contrast to PD, the symptoms associated with acute post-encephalic parkinsonism may also disappear in several cases [27,32,33]; in autopsy studies, no Lewy body formations have been found [34].",
            "The pathogenesis of PD has been extensively discussed; in addition to genetics, neuroinflammation seems to play a likely role, whether idiopathic or triggered by a pathogen. The interactions between different causes have formed the ‘multiple hit’ theory, which assumes that many incidences, such as genetic disposition and several infections (gastric or respiratory), during a lifetime accumulate in the development of PD [11,35].",
            "We have elaborated on these points in the following sections, and discussed important aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and PD.",
            "Many COVID-19 studies published to date are from regions in Italy that were severely affected during the first wave of the pandemic. A higher prevalence of COVID-19 in PD patients was confirmed in a case–control survey of 740 PD patients in Tuscany [36]. Overall, 7% of the entire PD population and up to 11% of those aged 65–85 years were affected by COVID-19, compared to <1% of the Italian population in general [36]. However, a case–control study in 1486 PD patients and 1207 family members from the Lombardy region demonstrated no difference in COVID-19 rates (7.1% vs. 7.6%, respectively) [37]. In terms of severe disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection, cardiovascular comorbidities appear to be a risk factor, rather than PD itself [36,38,39]. Data from 696 PD patients, 184 with parkinsonism symptoms and 8590 age-matched controls, from Northern Italy indicated that hospitalization rates due to SARS-CoV-2 infections were similar between the PD patients (0.7%) and the controls (0.6%) [40]. However, there was a higher hospitalization rate (3.3%) in parkinsonism patients (e.g., those with progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy or vascular parkinsonism), due to a more severe health status, greater frailty, and a higher need for care in nursing homes with higher infection rates [40]. Similarly, a small study from Spain showed that institutionalized PD patients were at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, development of COVID-19, and suffered more often from dementia as a comorbidity [41].",
            "In a cross-sectional study of 102 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients, we investigated the frequency, type, severity, and risk of neurological involvement in COVID-19 patients [42]. Across the cohort, 59.8% of the patients had neurological involvement. We found that 25 (24.5%) patients suffered from unspecific neurological involvement, such as worsening of a pre-existing neurological condition (8.5%, n = 5), including one patient with exacerbation of pre-existing PD. We additionally investigated the relationship between pre-existing neurological comorbidities and the presence or severity of neurological involvement, and found increasing frequency and severity among those patients with pre-existing neurological comorbidities, including PD. This is not surprising, as PD patients with infections show an increase in severity of the disease symptoms—an observation that is also true for PD patients suffering from COVID-19 [39,43]. Several different hypotheses, directly or indirectly associated with PD, have been proposed for this phenomenon [44]. Increasing OFF times and motor fluctuations have been reported in a community-based study with 141 PD patients in the Lombardy region of Italy, of which 12 (8.5%) patients also had COVID-19 [39]. It was assumed that the deterioration of PD symptoms observed among the COVID-19 PD patients was due either to a direct influence of the infection or impaired pharmacokinetics of the dopaminergic treatment (e.g., diarrhea) [39]. As a direct consequence, it has been suggested that dopaminergic medication should be increased or adjusted during infection [39,45]. This study only observed patients for a period of three months, so data on long-term effects, worsening, or remission were not collected. Deterioration of PD motor symptoms may also precede a diagnosis of COVID-19, as described in two PD patients with poor outcomes after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation [46]. On the other hand, common symptoms of COVID-19, such as anosmia or fatigue, belong to the spectrum of non-motor PD signs. In most published studies, the mortality rate due to COVID-19 does not differ between PD patients and the general population [36,37]. However, mortality is much higher (up to 40%) in the advanced stages of PD, with advanced age and comorbidities [45,47].",
            "Parkinsonian symptoms due to the development of COVID-19 are rare, and evidence linking COVID-19 to developing PD is currently hypothetical. We screened the literature for cases describing the new onset of PD associated with COVID-19 and identified six cases of patients with new parkinsonism motor symptoms; in five of these cases, there was evidence of impaired dopaminergic uptake in the basal ganglia after nuclear imaging (Table 1) [48,49,50,51,52,53].",
            "These six cases described the acute onset of parkinsonian symptoms with rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ages ranged from 35 to 72 years. In three cases [48,50,51], COVID-19 symptoms were mild to moderate; one patient had a short hospitalization of three days, while the other two patients did not need hospital treatment. In the other three cases [49,52,53], treatment in an ICU, with mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy, was required. PD symptoms began from 5 days up to 10 weeks after the positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Four cases were treated with dopaminergic medication, which improved the symptoms in two cases [48,50]. In one case, constipation for ten years was stated as a putative prodromal symptom [51]. Follow-up data were available in three cases; one patient had no symptoms after two months of follow-up [52], another had minor symptoms that were still present after 4 months of treatment with pramipexole [48], while the third patient was still impaired and unable to walk without aid [53].",
            "Unfortunately, there are no follow-up data for evidence of a parainfectious or chronic impairment. In two cases, impairment was reported after nine months. The latter case [53] was still unable to walk without aid after nine months. This might be due to general weakness after COVID-19 and encephalopathy, rather than to parkinsonian symptoms. In the other case, their parkinsonian symptoms improved after treatment with pramipexole, with the addition of biperiden to manage the residual resting tremor [48].",
            "Nuclear imaging in five of these cases (using FP-CIT-SPECT and F-DOPA-PET) revealed evidence that the basal ganglia were affected, where chronic impairment of dopaminergic transmission, resulting from nigrostriatal degeneration, contributed to motor symptoms [54,55]. In one case [53], FDG-PET imaging showed diffuse cortical hypometabolism, with significant hypometabolism in the precuneus, most likely associated with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease [56]. Congruently, this patient demonstrated cognitive decline during the progression of COVID-19, but also showed relative hypermetabolism in the basal ganglia, as often observed in PD patients [56]. Patients with acute encephalitis also show hypermetabolism in the affected brain regions and hypometabolism after remission [57,58]. Therefore, in this case [53], hypermetabolism in the basal ganglia was most likely due to the encephalopathic process. In two cases, good responses to dopaminergic medication indicated that the impairment was responsive to dopaminergic substitution, which is congruent with the nuclear imaging.",
            "It remains unclear whether COVID-19 induced PD, whether the disease revealed undiagnosed PD, or whether the disease induced encephalitis of the basal ganglia (post-encephalitic parkinsonism). Long-term data for evidence that SARS-CoV-2 induces PD do not yet exist. PD is defined by its motor symptoms of rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor, and its loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra (because of the accumulation of alpha-synuclein, which leads to neurodegeneration). In addition, PD progressively worsens over time, which has not been observed in these cases so far.",
            "Clinical follow-up data to implicate a progressive neurodegenerative disease are missing in all six cases. However, at least one case had complete remission of PD symptoms [52], suggesting that an acute reversible parkinsonian condition is possible. On the other hand, nuclear imaging showed impaired dopaminergic transmission in all the examined patients, providing strong evidence for a neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, in one case, a prodromal symptom (constipation) was present [51], indicating that undiagnosed PD must be considered, although constipation is a non-specific prodromal symptom that can have other causes.",
            "Given the small number of reported cases and the large number of infected people worldwide, parkinsonian symptoms linked to a SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 are likely to be a very rare condition. In addition, compared to the small number of cases of viral parkinsonism caused by other viruses, post-encephalitic parkinsonism may be a neuroinflammatory reaction to the infection, rather than a virus-specific disease. However, coronaviruses have been found in the CSF; thus, infection with a virus such as SARS-CoV-2 might be linked to the onset of PD. Furthermore, only a relatively short period of time has passed since the start of the pandemic; it is possible that, in the long term, symptoms of PD may occur months after infection with SARS-CoV-2.",
            "The pandemic is not only a burden for PD patients with COVID-19. PD patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, but without COVID-19, and non-infected PD patients also suffer from the current situation. PD patients are vulnerable to new life events and changes, especially negative ones. In particular, negative emotional stress can lead to an increase in symptoms, effects that can be partially explained by the impaired dopaminergic function in PD patients [59,60]. Additionally, social isolation during lockdown periods has reduced the access of PD patients to their physicians and co-therapists (physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists). For example, during the lockdown period in Italy, many PD patients reported worsening of their motor, non-motor, and neuropsychiatric symptoms [61]. A French study analyzed the consequences of a sudden lockdown in 2653 PD patients [62]. In 88% of all the patients, physiotherapy was interrupted, and many motor symptoms and pain worsened during the observation period of four weeks between March and April 2020. Around 45% of the patients also reported that their psychiatric state (i.e., depression and anxiety) had been exacerbated by the situation.",
            "Adaptive digital (i.e., remote) treatment strategies during the pandemic are, therefore, important, including telemedicine treatment from physicians and services provided by co-therapists. Head-to-head studies must also evaluate whether this is a long-term alternative to personal contact. The pandemic provides an opportunity to assess these treatments and the potential of wearable sensors, for example, to monitor treatment or disease progression.",
            "The post-COVID-19 syndrome has been defined as the “signs and symptoms that develop during or after an infection consistent with COVID-19, continue for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis” [63]. In a small series of 23 PD patients, 85% developed post-COVID-19 symptoms, including worsening of motor functions, fatigue, and cognitive disturbances [64]. This has been the only published study addressing this condition so far. However, these results must be interpreted with caution, due to the study’s small sample size and the diagnostic criteria that are yet to be defined for post-COVID-19 syndrome in PD patients. In addition, other effects, such as isolation due to lockdown periods and reduced access to physiotherapists, must be considered.",
            "In another unpublished study, we included 171 (mean age 43.2 ± 12.7 years (range 18–71 years)) patients who fulfilled the WHO case definition of the post-COVID-19 condition, as defined by the Delphi consensus [65]. In a subanalysis we performed on this dataset, we discovered that none of the patients described motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, impaired posture, or tremor, after infection with SARS-CoV-2. These findings were underlined by the fact that, after diagnostic workup, PD was not diagnosed among these patients. In addition, none of the 171 post-COVID-19 patients presented previously diagnosed PD (own data).",
            "On the one hand, this finding could be due to the younger age of the patients who presented with post-COVID-19 syndrome in our out-patient clinic, where neurodegenerative diseases do not have a high prevalence. However, we suppose that PD patients might not explicitly attribute the worsening of non-motor PD symptoms to COVID-19. Hence, we speculate that post-COVID syndrome does not play a major role in PD patients.",
            "Taking together the differentiation between post-COVID-19 syndrome in PD and the general worsening of PD symptoms due to COVID-19 bears difficulties. Most of the post-COVID-19 syndrome-associated symptoms, such as fatigue and cognitive disturbances, overlap with the non-motor symptoms of PD. Worsening of PD symptoms in PD patients often occurs during systemic inflammation, due to a viral or bacterial infection [66,67]. Patients do not always fully recover, and may remain in a worse condition than before. In a case study with 80 PD patients with systemic inflammation, 26 patients suffered from motor deterioration, 19 of whom still suffered a persistent decline in motor functions six months after infection [66]. The following pathophysiological considerations address this issue [44]: (1) Altered dopaminergic medication, due to swallowing difficulties, reduced intestinal uptake, e.g., diarrhea, or altered the permeability of the blood–brain barrier. (2) Altered cerebral dopamine metabolism, due to altered levels of cytokines. (3) Enhanced neurodegeneration, due to enhanced neuroinflammation. Chronic neuroinflammation is a driving factor in neurodegenerative diseases [15,68], so this aspect best explains the persistent decline in PD symptoms after infection.",
            "Similarly, the mechanism of chronic neuroinflammation is discussed in post-COVID-19 syndrome [69,70], yet studies investigating this issue are still missing.",
            "Cases of patients who have developed parkinsonism after COVID-19, as a post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), similar to encephalitis lethargica in the last century, have not been described yet, except in one case, who developed parkinsonism 10 weeks after SARS-CoV2-infection and had motor symptoms months later [53].",
            "Since PD is a neurodegenerative disease, with a long latency until the onset of the first motor symptoms, it is important to ask patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome about motor symptoms.",
            "At this stage of the pandemic, predictions are difficult to make.",
            "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has a significant impact on PD patients, regardless of whether they have been infected by the virus. PD per se does not represent a risk factor for increased mortality associated with COVID-19, but advanced age and disease progression in a PD patient do have a negative impact. Isolation and limited access to medical care services can lead to aggravation of the symptoms in PD patients. Parkinsonian symptoms occurring in response to COVID-19 is a rare condition, and evidence linking it to the development of PD is currently hypothetical.",
            "As a limitation, we have to state that many studies have been performed and data have been collected about PD patients and COVID-19 in the first six months of the pandemic, with cohorts of up to 2500 patients, but only a few were conducted in the following months and years. In the meantime, with millions of infected people worldwide, the number of infected PD patients is also expected to be higher. This gap must be filled, in order to understand the possible link between PD and COVID-19.",
            "A second limitation is that most studies on PD and SARS-CoV-2 generally examined patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, but no reliable data about atypical Parkinson’s disease were found.",
            "According to our own data, Parkinson symptoms do not frequently occur in patients with post-COVID syndrome. The already broadly discussed threat of a post-pandemic Parkinson pandemic, as was the case almost a hundred years ago, cannot be confirmed at the current stage, but must be re-evaluated in the future.",

            "The SARS-CoV-2 virus, first reported in December 2019 in China, is the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic that, at the time of writing (1 November 2020) has infected almost 43 million people and caused the death of more than 1 million people. The spectrum of clinical manifestations observed during COVID-19 infection varies from asymptomatic to critical life-threatening clinical conditions. Emerging evidence shows that COVID-19 affects far more organs than just the respiratory system, including the heart, kidneys, blood vessels, liver, as well as the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). It is also becoming clear that the neurological and psychological disturbances that occur during the acute phase of the infection may persist well beyond the recovery. The aim of this review is to propel further this emerging and relevant field of research related to the pathophysiology of neurological manifestation of COVID-19 infection (Neuro-COVID). We will summarize the PNS and CNS symptoms experienced by people with COVID-19 both during infection and in the recovery phase. Diagnostic and pharmacological findings in this field of study are strongly warranted to address the neurological and psychological symptoms of COVID-19.",
            "During the last two decades, novel viral epidemics have primarily affected the respiratory system. Among these, we can mention the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV, from 2002 to 2003, the swine flu caused by the H1N1 influenza virus in 2009 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2012 caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS)-CoV. More recently, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, first reported in December 2019 in China, caused the current pandemic of COVID-19 infection which at the time of writing (1 November 2020) has infected almost 43 million individuals and provoked the death of more than 1 million people [1].",
            "The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 challenges both the governments and healthcare systems worldwide with unprecedented social and economic distress. The global burden of the disease has motivated the scientific and medical community across the globe to focus their efforts on studying the pathogenetic mechanisms and the course of the disease, propelled by the urgent need to discover efficient prophylactic and therapeutic approaches.",
            "The spectrum of clinical manifestations observed during COVID-19 infection varies from asymptomatic to critical life-threatening clinical conditions [1]. COVID-19 infection is classified into mild, moderate, severe, and critical depending on the symptoms. The asymptomatic or mild course is seen in some 80% of patients, another 15% experience a serious course requiring hospitalization and 5% have a critical illness [2,3]. These latter 5% of the patients may experience life-threatening conditions such as septic shock, cardiac and respiratory failures and multiple organ dysfunction [1]. According to the Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 4.5% (Johns Hopkins dashboard, 11 July 2020.",
            "The latest studies and emerging clinical data demonstrate that COVID-19 affects far more organs than just the respiratory system [4,5,6,7,8]. This is due to the strong affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [9] expressed in several cell types including vascular endothelial cells, the renal tubular epithelium, and Leydig cells in the testes [10]. The ACE2 receptor plays a key role in the renin–angiotensin system regulating blood pressure, fluid and electrolyte balance and systemic vascular resistance [11]. The virus enters the host cells through binding with the ACE2 receptor. In contrast to its predecessor SARS-CoV that also recognizes the ACE2 as its receptor [12], the entry of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell is further facilitated by another protein called furin that cracks the virus open and allows its genetic material to pour into the host cell. In return, the additional proteins required by the original SARS virus—pangolins—are only present in lung tissue which justifies their limitation to the respiratory system [13].",
            "Furin is present in all human cells and particularly in endothelial cells [14]. Following the viral entry into the human body, direct attack on organs and systems that are characterized by vast expressions of the ACE2 receptor is initiated. These organs include the heart, kidneys, blood vessels, liver, as well as the CNS. The resulting increase in several pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to infection [15] and their diffusion to other organs, may cause multi-organ damage. Clinical evidence for endothelial cell damage in the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, and intestines in people with COVID-19 further establishes the disease as multi-organ and differentiates it from other known viral infections as influenza-like H1N1, SARS virus, which almost exclusively targets the lungs. Other viruses like Ebola or Dengue can also damage endothelial cells, but they are very different from viruses that typically infect the lungs [16]. This scenario is consistent with autopsies and biopsies that have reported SARS-CoV-2 viral particles not only in the nasal passages and throat, but also in the kidneys, liver, pancreas, and heart tissues as well as excreted in tears, stool and urine [6,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. Hence, through this pathogenetic mechanism, SARS-CoV-2 acts more like a multi-organ disease, affecting the whole body rather than causing respiratory damage alone (Figure 1 and Figure 2) [8].",
            "Recent evidence indicates that both the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) could be targeted by the virus and that this could lead to clinical symptoms and associated diseases of different severity [32,33]. “Neuro-COVID” is the newly established term for the neurological, psychiatric and psychological clinical manifestations related to COVID-19.",
            "In addition, there is also increasing awareness that the neurological and psychobiological disturbances caused by the virus during the acute phase of the infection may persist well beyond recovery. COVID-19 may provoke a broad spectrum of disorders that require strong efforts to dissect the pathogenetic mechanisms and identify therapeutic approaches facilitating the full functional recovery of the patients.",
            "To address the growing epidemiological, socioeconomic and clinical relevance, the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) together with the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS) endorsed the Global Consortium Studies of Neurological Dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-Neuro-COVID)—an established formal collaboration which is the largest global network to date [34].",
            "According to a recent Editorial in The Lancet Neurology, one of the priorities of this collaboration will be to develop consensus and data harmonization with uniform definitions [35].",
            "The aim of the current review is to propel further this emerging field of research related to the pathophysiology of Neuro-COVID and consolidate a unitary vision some of the CNS and PNS symptoms and clinical manifestations observed during the infection and through recovery.",
            "The pathogenetic mechanisms of COVID-19 and the clinical course of the disease are outside the focus of this review have been described in recent reviews by ourselves and others [36,37]. It may nonetheless be useful to emphasize the converging knowledge showing pleiotropic and still interconnected mechanisms of COVID-19 manifesting through enhanced inflammatory responses of the innate immune system and the inflammasome with the induction of a cytokine storm and the related or unrelated activation of thrombotic diathesis that may lead to diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) [15,36,37].",
            "It is also known, but still useful to recall, the increased risk of severe COVID-19 posed by comorbidities such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and aging. In the elderly, these conditions may be linked by a process of chronic inflammation called “inflammaging” making them more prone to uncontrolled immune–inflammatory responses to the SARS-CoV-2 infection [38,39,40,41,42,43].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 [44] exhibits neurotropism through its affinity for the ACE2 receptor in endothelial cells [45]. ACE2 is also found in the brain [45] and it is expressed in neural tissue (glial cells and neurons) making them a potential target for the virus [46]. The neurotropism of COVID-19 accords with the wide spectrum of neurological, psychiatric and psychological symptoms and syndromes affecting the entire nervous system in the course of infection (Figure 3).",
            "However, it is still debated whether or not the virus directly infects the CNS. One study in this area of research did not report evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 or its particles in the brain during the autopsy of patients with COVID-19, in spite of the viral invasion in various organs However, a first study did not report evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 or its particles in the brain at autopsy of patients with COVID-19 infection in spite of the invasion of the virus in various organs such as lungs, liver and heart [47]. On the other hand, Moriguchi et al. [48] observed viral RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with aseptic encephalitis and Paniz-Mandolfi et al. [49] reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in the neuronal and capillary endothelial cells in the frontal lobe tissue in a postmortem study. It has therefore been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, neuroinflammation and impairment of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) are responsible for the neurological symptoms [50].",
            "Other members of the coronaviruses family have been reported to exhibit neuroinvasiveness and neurotoxicity that are clinically characterized by a broad spectrum of symptoms that include altered mental status, meningoencephalitis and seizures, as well as post-recovery complications such as headaches and memory loss [51]. It is also known that various neurological diseases may accompany the coronaviruses infections, such as encephalitis [52] optic neuritis [53], multiple sclerosis [54] and Parkinson’s disease (PD) [55].",
            "In particular, the SARS-CoV epidemic from 2003 was associated with polyneuropathy, encephalitis, and ischemic stroke [56]. Cases of cerebral edema and meningeal vasodilation, infiltration of immune cells into the vascular wall, accompanied by the demyelination of nerve fibers and ischemic neuronal damage were also reported [57].",
            "The MERS-CoV infection from 2012 also exhibited neurotoxic potential with symptoms that included neurological and neuropsychological impairments (25% of patients) and seizures (8.6%) [58]. Other neurological complications manifested as impaired consciousness, ischemic stroke, Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), and other neuropathies [59].",
            "It is generally accepted that coronaviruses may access the CNS through the hematogenous route and/or the neuronal retrograde dissemination.",
            "The hematogenous route may occur via infected leukocytes that cross the BBB carrying the virus to the CNS and/or by the direct infection of brain microvascular endothelial cells, which express ACE2. Nonetheless, the hematogenous route does not seem to be involved in the CNS invasion by SARS-CoV-2, since, as discussed, virtually no viral particles were detected in non-neuronal cells of the infected brain areas in the early stage of infection [60].",
            "The neuronal route can occur via olfactory nerves and/or via the enteric nervous system (Figure 4). However, the fact that ACE2 in neurons in the olfactory system do not express ACE2 questions this route for SARS-CoV-2 entry into CNS. Hence, ACE2-independent mechanisms have been proposed to explain the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells at least via the olfactory route. In contrast, ACE2 expression occurs in small intestine endothelial cells which connect with neurons in the enteric nervous system. This is consistent with the frequent occurrence of, gastrointestinal symptoms in a subset of patients with COVID-19 as well as with SARS-CoV-2 isolation from oral and anal swabs of these patients. In this way, SARS-CoV-2 could access the enteric nervous system, via the vagus nerve, as a possible pathway for the CNS [60]. In addition, recent studies have suggested that the transmembrane receptor neuropilin-1 may also be implicated in the neurotropism of COVID-19. In fact, NRPI is highly expressed in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium and and may enhance the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the brain through this route. Recently NRP1 has also been shown to be expressed in the CNS, including olfactory-related regions such as the olfactory tubercles and para-olfactory gyri therefore strenghtering its possible role as additional site of entry for SARS-CoV-2 in the brain [61]. We will briefly depict below the proposed ACE2 receptor-dependent and ACE2-receptor-independent pathways of brain infection that may be used from SARS-CoV-2.",
            "The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry through binding to its specific host receptor ACE2 was already discussed [12]. The ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in the brain stem and in the regions responsible for the regulation of cardiovascular function including the subfornical organ, paraventricular nucleus, and the nucleus of the tractus solitarius as well as rostral ventrolateral medulla. ACE2 has also been detected in glial cells and neurons.",
            "A relevant finding is also that the nicotine stimulation of the nACh receptor can increase ACE2 expression in neural cells, which places smokers at a higher risk for neurological complications by SARS-CoV-2 [63].",
            "The presence of SARS-Cov-2 in neurons and capillary endothelium cells in the postmortem examination of frontal lobe tissue supports the hematogenous pathway of viral entry into the brain [49,64].",
            "After entering the general circulation, the virus may migrate to the brain where its replication begins and provokes a powerful immune response that, if uncontrolled, may lead to cerebral edema [45]. The combination of infection and immune response forms the typical clinical manifestation of viral meningitis/encephalitis.",
            "In a manner similar to both severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS), SARS-CoV-2 might also take a direct trans-synaptic route via the olfactory bulb upon inhalation without using the ACE2 receptors. Animal studies demonstrated the potential of SARS-CoV to cause neuronal death by accessing the brain through the olfactory epithelium [65]. Virus invasion causes reactive astrogliosis and triggers a massive neuroinflammatory cascade in the CNS.",
            "Recently, Takeshi et al. reported the first case of meningitis/encephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2. They detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen [19], providing direct evidence of the neuroinvasiveness of the virus. This finding concurs with the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 may directly enter into the nervous system and that the clinical symptoms it induces could be directly caused by the virus and are not necessary a secondary effect of the immune response to the virus [48,66].",
            "The gustatory or olfactory disorders observed in a significant proportion (33.9%) of COVID-19 patients are consistent with the hypothesis that the virus reaches the brain through neurons of the olfactory bulb by a direct trans-synaptic pathway [65].",
            "Laboratory studies reveal increased inflammatory markers (white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and d-dimer) and evidence of multi-organ involvement as witnessed by elevated liver enzymes and abnormal renal function tests [67,68].",
            "While some authors believe that neurological symptoms may be a consequence of the multi-organ damage caused by COVID-19 [68], it was also suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting the neurons. Supportive evidence comes from studies on so-called organoids that are small structures of brain tissue composed of human pluripotent stem cells manipulated to differentiate into neurons. Researchers demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infects the organoids and leads to partial neural death as well as a reduction of synapse formation [69,70]. Direct damage can occur when the virus enters the nervous system via the neuronal retrograde (olfactory bulb and/or n. Trigeminus), blood (overcoming BBB) and immune-mediated pathways (via immune cells that transmit the pathogen) Figure 5.",
            "On the other hand, emerging evidence also indicates that in addition to direct viral invasion to the CNS, indirect CNS involvement through viral-mediated immune response is also possible [71].",
            "After entering the central circulation, the viral particles bind to BBB endothelial cells and the brain–cerebrospinal fluid barrier epithelial cells that express ACE2 receptors [72].",
            "Indirect mechanisms of neurotoxicity may be mediated by immunocompetent and inflammatory cells responsible for exacerbating the pro-inflammatory status of the CNS [73]. The increased activity and expression of immune cells, cytokines, radicals and other substances are associated with the most severe clinical cases with concomitant manifestations of neurological complications. The frequent cases of depression observed during COVID-19 infection may also be due to the massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease [74,75,76].",
            "In support of these pathogenetic mechanisms, elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been described after infection with COVID-19 including—IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, TNF-α [77] and interferon γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10, a T-cell chemoattractant chemokine) [78]. Elevated levels of IP-10 have also been linked to virus-induced demyelination [79].",
            "Virus-induced hypoxia is another non-specific mechanism of damage targeting multiple organs and systems, including the nervous system. This indirect pathogenetic mechanism leads to pulmonary complications and damage to gas exchange [72] with subsequent hypoxia and metabolic acidosis, causing the vasodilation and edema of the brain. The condition is associated with a high risk of increased intracranial pressure and acute cerebrovascular accidents",
            "The described direct and indirect CNS-damaging mechanisms of COVID-19 may be manifested in different sequences or occur simultaneously. It has, however, been proposed that neurological symptoms may precede respiratory ones [80].",
            "Neuroinflammation may represent an important pathogenetic mediator by at least two mechanisms entailing the BBB damage induction of hypoxia and homeostatic dysregulation.",
            "The systemic SARS-CoV-2-associated neuroinflammation compromises the BBB with consequential disturbance of brain homeostasis and the potential induction of neuronal death [67,81,82]. Although the endothelial cells lining the brain capillaries and comprising the first layer of BBB [83] differ in several aspects from the endothelial cells in the other parts of the body they are also a target for SARS-CoV-2 and become infected during viremia. This immune reaction involving cytokines compromises the function of the barrier [81]. Neural damage may lead to complications, systemic homeostatic dysregulation, multiple organ failure and acute respiratory failure that are the causes most closely linked to COVID-19 mortality [84].",
            "Adding important insights into possible pathogenetic mechanisms at the base of Neuro-COVID are recent observations by Buzhdygan and coworkers [82]. By using postmortem brain tissue these authors have first confirmed that the ACE2 is ubiquitously expressed throughout various vessel calibers in the frontal cortex. Moreover, they also observed upregulated ACE2 expression in cases of hypertension and dementia. ACE2 was also detectable in primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVEC) “in vitro”. They demonstrated that neither the S1, S2 nor a truncated form of the S1 containing only the receptor-binding domain impaired hBMVEC viability. The introduction of spike proteins in in vitro models of the BBB showed significant changes to barrier properties. In particular, S1 provoked the loss of barrier integrity in an advanced 3D microfluidic model of the human BBB. These findings accord with the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins may evoke a pro-inflammatory response in brain endothelial cells that may contribute to a malfunctioning of the BBB. This scenario offers an additional pathogenetic mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for the neurological consequences observed in COVID-19 patients [82].",
            "In the brain, ACE2 receptors are predominantly present in the brain stem and the regions responsible for the regulation of cardiovascular function [85] which makes this CNS region more vulnerable to the damaging effect of SARS-CoV-2. This is why some authors hypothesize that CNS respiratory dysregulation may be the root cause for the respiratory failure observed in COVID-19 which is especially valid for patients without comorbidities and other risk factors [86].",
            "Normal homeostasis is dependent on the adequate functioning of afferent and efferent sections of the autonomous nervous system. Damage to this function could lead to ventilatory function impairment as well as the exacerbation of the respiratory failure resulting in profound hypoxia. The combination of hypoxia with existent neuroinflammation leads to damage in the hippocampal and cortical areas manifesting as the neuropsychiatric effects of the virus [44,87].",
            "In agreement, it has been suggested that a large-scale cerebral involvement may cause cerebral edema that could be lethal well before the homeostatic dysregulation is fully activated [45].",
            "Regardless of the precise mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 enters the CNS and how precisely it exerts its pathogenetic effects, a large variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms affecting both the CNS and the PNS are reported in patients with COVID-19 [77].",
            "Nearly one-third of affected patients developed neurological symptoms that can either be related to the direct neurotoxicity of the virus or could be a complication of an existing disease. In both cases, this could lead to long-term damage [68].",
            "Paterson and coworkers [88] have warned of a potential wave of COVID-19-linked brain damage as new evidence suggests that COVID-19 it can lead to severe neurological complications. The wide spectrum of neurological symptoms varies in severity and manifestation over time and is also dependent on variables like age comorbidity, sex, as well as geographical location.",
            "Common neurological complications related to COVID-19 are presented in Figure 6 below.",
            "Most of the data of neurological complications in COVID-19 infection come from several observational studies from China, France, the UK and Italy. Summarized data are presented in Table 1.",
            "Early neurological symptoms include the loss of sense of smell and taste and also body aches, headache and myalgia.",
            "Anosmia/ageusia, fever, and myalgia are considered the strongest independent predictors of positive SARS-CoV-2 assays. Rapidly developing neurological complications manifesting usually at the beginning of the infection include dizziness, headache, ataxia, seizures. Three recent case reports describe the development of acute parkinsonism following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and this has generated concern on the possible induction of PD by SARS-CoV-2 [105]. This case and previous evidence of possible link between coronaviruses and PD is alarming the scientific community of a potential role of COVID-19 in the potential emergence of Parkinsonism as a third wave of consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [106,107].",
            "COVID-19-related neurological damage is often recognized late in the course of the disease and its predictive significance remains unclear. Dyspnea remains the only strongly predictive symptom for both moderate and severe disease that can be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness [108].",
            "Late neurological manifestations are impaired mental status, acute cerebrovascular accidents such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and conditions associated with neural demyelination. Other complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 are meningitis, encephalomyelitis, encephalitis, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) [109] (Table 1).",
            "During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, patients have experienced different and less frequent symptoms including headache (6.5%), dizziness (9.4%), nausea (10.1%), vomiting (3.6%), abdominal pain (2.2%), and shock (8.7%), in addition to the characteristic symptoms such as fever (98.6%), fatigue (69.6%), dry cough (59.4%), anorexia (39.9%) myalgia (34.8%), dyspnea (31.2%), arrhythmia (16.7%), and acute cardiac injury (7.2%) [90]. Some patients have also reported difficulty breathing as well as gait alterations [68,110] (Table 1).",
            "Although the involvement of both the CNS and PNS is now well documented, the percentage of patients suffering from these complications varies widely across different studies, assessment time-points as well as geographical location [86]. For example, the incidence of neurological symptoms in patients in France was 14% at the time of admission in hospitals and 69% after the discontinuation/completion of the therapeutic course [93]. Various neurological symptoms [68] were reported for 36.4% of the patients in Wuhan, China. CNS complications include dizziness (16.8%), headache (13.1%), altered consciousness (7.5%), stroke (2.8%), ataxia and seizures (0.5%); reported complications related to autonomic nervous system were impaired sense of smell (5.6%) and taste (5.1%) as well as visual disturbances (1.4%). Musculoskeletal complications accounted for 10.7% of all cases with neurological complications, and neuralgia was reported by 2.3% of patients (Table 1).",
            "Data generated in the UK indicate that some patients with COVID-19 may suffer from encephalopathies accompanied by delirium/psychosis while others develop inflammatory CNS syndromes including encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and peripheral neurological disorders like GBS, while a few have life-threatening ischemic strokes [88].",
            "Varatharaj et al. [96] reported neurological/psychiatric illnesses in 125 patients with COVID-19 for 3 weeks. One third of the patients (31%) had altered mental status, including 13% with encephalopathy and 18% with neuropsychiatric diagnosis entailing psychosis (8%), neuro-cognitive syndrome (5%), and affective disorder (3%). The authors state that 62% of the observed patients suffered cerebrovascular events, 74% of which were ischemic strokes, 12% intracerebral hemorrhages, and 1% CNS vasculitis.",
            "Although some authors consider that established neurological complications are most often associated with a severe clinical picture of the viral infection or with concomitant diabetes or hypertension [68,80] (Table 1) contradictory data have been generated in this regard. In patients with moderate symptoms of viral infection or even during recovery, COVID-19 may cause fatal brain and neurological damage of immune–inflammatory origin that leads to destructive changes of the myelin sheath of neurons in the brain and spinal cord leading to paralysis [84].",
            "CNS damage in the absence of lung symptoms has also been reported [81] in young patients (below 50 years of age) developing hemiplegia and impaired consciousness without other symptoms at the same time, and brain MRIs have demonstrated evidences of cerebral artery occlusion.",
            "It is also of interest, in this regard, that the findings of a recent meta-analysis reporting abnormal EEG findings in patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathies included altered mental status, seizure-like events, and cardiac arrest. Abnormal EEG findings were observed in 88.0% of the 543 patients and were sub-classified into three groups including background abnormalities, periodic and rhythmic EEG patterns, and epileptiform changes. It was also shown that approximately a third of all findings consisted of frontal EEG patterns. In studies that utilized continuous EEG, 96.8% of the 251 patients were reported to have abnormalities compared to 85.0% of the patients who did not undergo continuous EEG. Frontal findings were therefore frequent during Neuro-COVID and can be proposed as a marker for its development [111]. These data highlight the potential utility of using EEG for patients with COVID-19 infection exhibiting signs of CNS involvement.",
            "Many authors suggest that the neurotoxic effects of coronaviruses leading to life-threatening neurological conditions are not necessarily linked to the manifestation of severe respiratory symptoms [65,66,69].",
            "As regards peripheral neurological symptoms, a recent study showed that the most common peripheral COVID-19-related symptoms of infection in China included the loss of the sense of taste and smell (5%), visual disturbances (1.4%) and neuralgia (2.3%) [68] (Table 1).",
            "In Italy [97], different degrees of ageusia and anosmia have been reported in 10.2% and 5% of the patients, respectively, while 18.6% of patients complained of both. These symptoms were more common in young patients and in women.",
            "Other studies conducted in 12 European clinics showed that cases of mild to moderate disease were accompanied by olfactory (85.6%) and taste (88%) alterations with a high degree of correlation between them and also predominant in females [101]. For most patients, the recovery of sensitivity took several weeks and 44% of the patients recovered earlier (Table 1).",
            "Musculoskeletal injuries are 10.7% prevalent, mainly in patients with liver and kidney problems, according to Mao et al. [68]. Another study, involving 1099 patients from 550 hospitals in China, reported the occurrence of myalgia (14.9%). The severity of the observed symptoms correlated with the severity of the disease [112]. Rhabdomyolysis was observed in 0.2% of cases (Table 1).",
            "Based on the available information, Sheraton et al. (2020) [87] suggested that CNS symptoms mainly occur in connection with virus-induced inflammation. The PNS complications are secondary to immune-mediated processes, whereas musculoskeletal involvements are the result of the direct damaging effects of the virus [87].",
            "Cerebrovascular accidents usually occur in severe cases of the disease, affecting predominantly elderly patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comorbidities and diabetes.",
            "However, new data indicate that coronavirus-related ischemic strokes may not necessarily be age-related. In New York, five coronavirus patients in their 30s and 40s, most of whom had no past medical history, experienced life-threatening ischemic strokes. These cases may be multifactorial, on the one hand being related to the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to endothelial cells, which leads to endothelial damage and the formation of blood clots even in individuals with no history or risk of coagulation disorders [103], and on the other to the formation of antiphospholipid (anti-PL) autoantibodies [36].",
            "We already discussed that cerebrovascular events may be due to the presence of antiphospholipid (anti-PL) autoantibodies and that the presence of these autoantibodies should be tested in patients with coagulopathy and the elevation of d-dimer and lupus-like anticoagulant [36], which may be secondary to the upregulated activation of B lymphocytes [113].",
            "Due to the recent onset of the ongoing pandemic, it is still difficult to assess the risk of short-term or long-term complications in recovering patients. At present, there are more than 43 million people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and many of those who recovered carry the burden of cognitive and neurological sequelae [112,113]. All this is expected to affect their quality of life, ability to work and everyday activity. To date, the observed complications following COVID-19 recovery include demyelination and acute myelitis affecting the spinal cord [114] or cerebral edema accompanied by delirium. A study involving 29 patients categorized post-COVID-19 neurological complications into five main groups [88]. Some altered psychological parameters related to viral diseases were also reported as stress, depression, anxiety, and psychological abnormalities [115,116].",
            "It is worth recalling in this setting the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and the fact that more than 1 million people were diagnosed with encephalitis lethargica or “the sleepy sickness“ between 1917 and 1930. Damages, as a result of brain swelling, made many patients disabled by producing constant sleepiness and severe neurodegeneration [117].",
            "That multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms may be expected in the recovery phase of COVID-19 infection and especially those suffering from Neuro-COVID, which is in accordance with data from the SARS-CoV epidemic. It has been reported [118] that up to 42.5% of SARS survivors developed long-lasting psychiatric morbidity conditions that persisted at 4 years follow up. Conditions included mainly post-traumatic stress disorders (54.5%), depression (39%), somatoform pain disorder (36.4%), panic disorder (32.5%) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (15.6%) [118].",
            "The full assessment of the long-term risk of neurological complications will be very much needed once the COVID-19 pandemic is over so to weigh the delayed effects on the brain. There is concern that the coronavirus could bring an epidemic of “brain damage linked to the pandemic” because some brain-damage issues may not manifest for some time after patients have left the hospital [119].",
            "In particular, Beaucham and colleagues fear the development of SARS-CoV2-induced Parkinsonism, and suggest monitoring of recovering individuals for potential long-term consequences, which may include neurodegenerative impairments. [107].",
            "We also previously discussed the risk posed by the eventual long-lasting persistence of anti-PL autoantibodies in people with COVID-19 that eventually develop secondary anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) [36]. Cases of cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients positive for anti-PL autoantibodies and the kinetics of the disappearance of these autoantibodies remains to be studied. Patients that are positive for anti-PL autoantibodies will require careful laboratory monitoring and eventual anticoagulant treatment until the persistent disappearance of the autoantibodies.",
            "Another aspect of the COVID-19 sequelae that has to date probably been underestimated is the occurrence of chronic fatigue. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the international guidelines on the management of the infection were focused on the acute phase of the disease and the relatively severe complications and sequelae. However, several patients that recovered from COVID-19 infection are increasingly reporting chronic fatigue regardless of whether or not they had neurological complications during the course of the disease [120]. Carfi et al. report that as many as 87.4% of patients assessed approximately 60 days after discharged report at least one persisting symptom, particularly fatigue and dyspnea [120].",
            "Several follow-up studies on patients infected with SARS-CoV also suggest that coronavirus can cause long-term fatigue. In a study conducted on 22 SARS survivors, it was found that they all remained unable to return to work and to their pre-SARS daily life in a period of time ranging between 13 and 36 months after declared infection free [121]. In another study assessing 233 SARS survivors in China, 40% were reported to have suffered chronic fatigue 4 years after recovery [115].",
            "A limiting factor to assessing the severity of chronic fatigue is that there are no data for the level of fatigue before the coronavirus disease and especially since there is no biomarker or any other approach to objectively assess fatigue. The evaluation is based solely on the information provided by the patients which complicates the efficient management of this symptom.",
            "Based on current knowledge and on the reported experience with SARS-CoV we hypothesize that the neuro-behavioral sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 will necessitate a close interaction between primary care, emergency medicine, in-patient treatment, as well as psychological and psychiatry interventions at specific phases and stages. The use of psychotherapy may also be anticipated as it has been suggested that it may lead to measurable neuroimaging changes associated with functional improvement. The beneficial effects of a psychosocial intervention on the function of the immune system with changes persisting for at least 6 months following treatment have also been demonstrated [122]. This may be of particular relevance given the immune pathogenesis of severe cases of COVID-19 that may cause subtle but long lasting derangement in the homeostasis of the immune system.",
            "Along this line of reasoning, Pallanti et al. [123] suggested the utility of the stratification of patients recovered from COVID-19 based on an inflammatory panel that may help design appropriate therapeutic and rehabilitative programs entailing a reduction of stigma associated with mental health sequelae.",
            "A point that has been anticipated in a recent review and that deserves further attention as it risks to be underestimated is the potential impact that both symptomatic or asymptomatic maternal infections may have on the offspring [123]. There are several factors that may jeopardize a successful physiological pregnancy during COVID-19 infection. This may pose a risk in the early phases of neurodevelopment in children because the exposure of the mother to inflammation during pregnancy is associated with the later development of neuropsychiatric disorders in human offspring [124]. This is consistent with the known role played by proinflammatory events in the pathogenesis of mood disorders [125], possibly via the release of inflammatory mediators such as certain cytokines that impact neurodevelopment [75,126,127,128].",
            "We anticipate that the offspring of mothers infected with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 will require continuous monitoring for neuropsychiatric, neuroimmune and inflammatory status in longitudinal studies to better understand the pathophysiology and to allow for early intervention.",
            "Italy was among the most severely affected countries with very high infection incidence as well as a very high number of severe cases. The analysis of the data gathered in Italy indicates that COVID-19 management should not be concluded with the completion of the therapeutic plan and negative assays but it should also imply a rehabilitation plan for the reconvalescent patients [80].",
            "Neurological complications in patients with viral infection, which also increase the risk of a more severe course of the disease, are a prerequisite for harder and slower recovery after the discontinuation of the artificial ventilation used in acute respiratory distress syndrome. The longer and more severe convalescence period is also related to the need for better rehabilitation.",
            "Some of the COVID-19 survivors may need a long rehabilitation period, both physical rehabilitation such as exercise and mental/cognitive rehabilitation.",
            "Once that the involvement and the relevance of neurological complications during COVID-19 infection has been established, it will be important to evaluate potential biomarkers that may afford the early identification of patients at risk of Neuro-COVID as well as designing tailored therapeutic approaches for its prevention. Along this line of research, for example, we and others have shown that the mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, which regulates multiple processes of cell growth and metabolism, also implicated in response to viral infection, is hyperactivated in response to SARS-Cov-2 infection [15,129,130].",
            "The hyperactivated mTOR pathway may represent a potential pharmacological target for COVID-19 management. [15,129,130].",
            "Although mTOR hyperactivation in CNS during COVID-19 remains to be demonstrated, it is of interest to recall that the mTOR pathway has been implicated in several neurological diseases characterized by different extent of inflammation and degeneration such as multiple sclerosis [131], Alzheimer’s disease [132] and HIV-associated neurocognitive decline [133].",
            "We believe that evaluating the association between Neuro-COVID and its severity and mTOR and its upstream pathways PI3K and Akt activation both in PNS and CNS may offer important pathogenetic information and guide toward tailored therapeutic approaches based on inhibitors of either mTOR or the upstream pathways.",
            "As indicated, other potential players in the pathogenesis of Neuro-COVID are the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are triggered by SARS-CoV2 infection. It is known that pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurological and psychiatric disorders including Multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer’s disease and major depressive disorders [75,127,134,135]. Identifying one or more of the key cytokines triggering the neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 would allow for their pharmacological targeting to counteract the onset and progression of neuropathology.",
            "In this context, we hypothesized that a relevant role in the pathophysiology of Neuro-COVID may be played by brain-derived neurotophic factor (BDNF), which is the member of a family of neuronal growth factors that also include nerve growth factor (NGF), Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and NT-4/5. BDNF regulates neuronal maintenance, neuronal survival, plasticity, and neurotransmitter regulation. Patients with psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders often have reduced BDNF concentrations in their bloods and brains that may be secondary to the chronic inflammatory state of the brain in certain disorders [136], since BDNF is downstream the ACE2-Mas axis [137].",
            "It has therefore been hypothesized that the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 With ACE-2 may leads to the subsequent impairment of the downstream Mas/BDNF axis with the consequential reduction of BDNF and this may be centrally implicated in the pathogenesis of Neuro-COVID.",
            "The modification of BDNF in COVID-19 and especially in Neuro-COVID remains to be studied. To date, one preliminary study conducted in 16 patients has found significantly lower levels of serum BDNF in patients with severe or moderate disease as compared to patients with mild disease. The significance, if any, of this finding on the role of BDNF in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection and in particular of Neuro-COVID, are a clearly interesting area of research [138].",
            "It is now firmly established on the ground of clinical and pathological evidence that COVID-19 is not a purely respiratory infection but rather a multi-organ disease. This is mainly related to the capacity of the virus to bind the widely expressed ACE2 receptor along with its use of the cleavage protease (furin) which can be found in almost all human tissues. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 has strong affinity to the endothelium cells and results in endothelial damage, increased coagulation and disseminated micro-thrombosis.",
            "Several studies are also convergently depicting the frequent involvement of CNS and PNS during the course of COVID-19 leading to specific manifestation of the disease termed Neuro-COVID. Nervous system involvement occurs through direct or indirect mechanisms that provoke a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms including the failure of the regulation of respiratory function. We presently described the most common symptoms related to Neuro-COVID and proposed direct and indirect pathogenetic mechanisms of viral damage. We underscore that the understanding of the mechanisms of CNS and PNS damage is becoming essential for the development of approaches for early diagnosis of individuals at risk for developing Neuro-COVID as well as for the discovery of novel tailored therapeutic approaches. We hypothesized that the reported activation of the mTOR pathway and the upregulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 will represent novel valuable theranostics for the prevention and treatment of Neuro-COVID. In particular, emerging evidence suggests that alterations of both systemic and CNS levels of BDNF may occur in COVID-19 and that may be related to CNS symptoms and BDNF. We also suggest that particular attention should be paid to the early neurological and psychiatric development of newborns from mothers with COVID-19 infection for the known effects of immune-inflammation during pregnancy. Finally, we warn for the need for the accurate follow-up of patients with Neuro-COVID during the recovery phase to prevent long-term cognitive and neurological consequences. On the basis of current knowledge and on the reported experience with SARS-CoV, we emphasize that the neurobehavioral sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 will necessitate a close interaction between primary care, emergency medicine, in-patient treatment and mental health care with tailored interventions at specific phases and stages.",

            "From early 2020, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) burdened healthcare systems, especially intensive care units (ICUs). Short‐ and intermediate‐term mortality is high in hospital‐ and ICU‐admitted patients. However, mortality is low beyond 60–90 days from ICU admission [1, 2]. Apart from mortality, there are two distinct sets of consequences of ICU admission with COVID‐19: post‐COVID‐19 (also known as Long‐COVID) with multi‐organ impact, partially correlated to illness severity in non‐hospitalized individuals and post‐intensive care syndrome, related to multi‐organ failure and other factors during ICU stay [3, 4, 5, 6].",
            "General long‐term consequences of COVID‐19 are well described [3]; however, long‐term consequences in persons admitted to ICU are less well documented, especially in large cohorts from national registries not exposed to selection bias from excluding the most severely affected individuals. Moreover, except for one large meta‐analysis reporting on Long‐COVID symptoms, but not the functional consequences [7], the existing cohort studies on health‐related quality of life and sick leave are burdened by small sample sizes or partially self‐reported data in contrast to the prospective nature and large size of national registry studies [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], especially regarding ICU admitted patients. Return to work is a sensitive marker of recovered health in several disease categories, whereas inability to return to work is a strong marker of failed return of physical, cognitive, psychological, and social functions, that is, functional recovery [20, 21, 22, 23]. Return to work can be approximated by the end of sick leave, and the sickness cash benefit in Sweden is, by international standards, liberal and includes virtually the entire Swedish workforce but depends on medical assessment [24, 25]. Thus, the extent of not returning from sick leave is appropriate in approximating the return of function after severe illness based on medical assessment in a large cohort that covers the entire working population.",
            "We hypothesized that ICU‐treated patients would have fewer sick leave‐free days alive after adjustment for relevant confounding, reflecting a more severely affected health and function than hospitalized COVID‐19 patients without ICU treatment or controls from the general population. We also expected a similar sick leave pattern 1 year after inclusion in 1‐year survivors. Accordingly, we conducted a nationwide registry‐based study of sick leave after severe COVID‐19.",
            "This registry‐based cohort study with prospectively collected registry data is reported following the STROBE (strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology) guidelines [26]. The study was registered a priori on September 20, 2021, with a post hoc amendment on November 30, 2022, with ClinicalTrials.com (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05054608).",
            "The Swedish Intensive Care Registry (SIR), a level one quality registry, was used to identify ICU patients with COVID‐19. The registry covers all care episodes in all general ICUs in Sweden. The Swedish Board of Health and Welfare identified all individuals with at least one in‐patient episode with COVID‐19 in the National Patient Register (NPR). Reporting to the NPR is mandatory for all specialized care in Sweden. The NPR also provided information on previous health status. Statistics Sweden used the Total Population Registry (TPR) to draw random population control subjects, matched on age, sex, and area of residence, to the ICU patients in a 4:1 ratio. Statistics Sweden also provided demographic, labor market, and income information from the TPR and the Longitudinal integrated database for health insurance and labor market studies on all individuals in the study. These registries have complete coverage of all Swedish residents. Data on sick leave and sick pension, hereafter referred to as sick leave, were procured from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (SSIA) which administers sickness cash benefits. Sickness cash benefits cover all individuals in the labor market; however, during the first 2 weeks of sick leave, the employer is responsible for sickness benefits. Thus, the agency has data on sick leave beyond the first 2 weeks of the sick leave period. Using the personal identification number (PIN) available for all Swedish residents, we could link data from the different registries.",
            "We compared three groups of individuals: the ICU group, the hospital group, and the population control group. The inclusion criteria included having a Swedish PIN, hospital discharge between January 1, 2020 and July 20, 2020, and age 18–63 years. The age interval captures working‐age adults at a 1‐year follow‐up. Exclusion criteria included having received pension the last year before admission or having extensive sick leave in the period 6 months to 2 weeks before admission. Extensive sick leave was defined as having either 28 days of continuous sick leave or having > 5 separate sick leave episodes during the period [27]. The ICU group included ICU patients discharged with a COVID‐19 diagnosis code (U07.1 in the International Classification of Diseases—10th Revision, ICD‐10) as identified in the SIR. The hospital group comprised hospital‐admitted patients, not admitted to the ICU, discharged with a COVID‐19 diagnosis code U07.1 identified in the NPR. Both registries demand a positive polymerase chain reaction test for Sars‐Cov‐2 to use the ICD‐10 code U07.1. The third group, the population control group, consisted of random individuals matched to the ICU cohort by sex, age, and county. The population controls were not admitted to hospital or ICU with COVID‐19. The hospital discharge date was used as the inclusion date for the ICU and hospital groups. The population controls had their matching ICU patient's discharge date as the inclusion date. The individuals were included on their first admission with COVID‐19.",
            "Our primary outcome was odds ratio (OR) for having one or several more sick leave‐free days alive between the ICU patients and the hospital patients, as well as between the ICU patients and the population controls in ordinal logistic multiple regression. Sick leave‐free days alive was defined as the number of days the individual was alive without any degree of sick leave during the first year after inclusion. Our secondary outcome was OR for being on any degree of sick leave 1 year after inclusion between the ICU patients and the two control groups in binary logistic multiple regression models.",
            "Data are presented as medians with interquartile range (IQR) or numbers with percentages. Univariate comparisons were performed with the Mann–Whitney U test or chi‐square test as appropriate. Statistical significance was set at p‐value < 0.05 (two‐sided) and multiple comparisons in descriptive tables were addressed with the Bonferroni correction. Confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using a one‐sample binomial success rate for the proportion of individuals on sick leave per day after inclusion. For the primary outcome, we chose ordinal logistic regression with a logit link function to model sick leave‐free days alive based on Harrell's visual method [28]. Based on the estimate for the group variable, we calculated an unadjusted difference, with 95% CI in sick‐free days alive between groups using bootstrapping. Concordantly, we also estimated the adjusted difference between groups. The secondary outcome was modeled in binary logistic regression to assess the risk difference between groups for being on sick leave 1 year after inclusion. Lack of linearity between age and previous income and the outcomes was addressed by restricted cubic spline application in all models, and the ORs were calculated for the difference between the first and third quartiles [29]. The updated Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was treated as a factor, and due to empty cells, we categorized CCI 6 to 11 into CCI 6 for the statistical models [30]. Finally, due to several zero values, we applied square root transformation to previous income for statistical modeling. However, despite this, the model on being on sick leave 1 year after inclusion did not converge for ICU patients and population controls until we excluded the previous income variable. Adjustment variables were chosen based on directed acyclic graphs. Definitions for model variables are listed in the Supporting Information (Table S1) and all variables in the models are displayed in the results figures with accompanying estimates. We did not perform conditional models on the matched strata, which would be inappropriate in this cohort study design [31].",

The adjusted mean difference in sick leave‐free days alive between ICU patients and hospitalized patients was over 95 days, and the difference between ICU patients and population control individuals was 136 days. Thus, ICU patients are more exposed to sick leave than hospital patients and population controls, reflecting a slower, or incomplete functional recovery [9, 10, 11].",
            "Sick‐leave benefit in Sweden is linked to repeated medical assessments of functional level and thereby can be used for assessing recovery after COVID‐19. Physicians assessing patients for sick‐leave benefit use decision support, usually integrated in the electronic patient records, administered by the Swedish Board of Health and Welfare [25]. Subsequently, the SSIA decides whether the patient has a severe enough functional impairment from medical reasons, based on the written opinion of the physician. Previous small cohort studies have reported a wide range of proportions of sick leave and return to work during the first year after hospital or ICU admission in patients with COVID‐19 disease. In hospitalized cohorts, in which varying proportions of patients were admitted to an ICU, return to work after 2–24 months varied from 41% to 89% [12, 13, 14, 36] and in ICU‐admitted patients, return to work was 51%–88% after 2–12 months [9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18]. The latter outcomes contrast with our findings in that we report lower proportions being on sick leave. Returning to work, however, is a different endpoint than being on sick leave, as it implies that the individual is working at the time of inclusion. Moreover, returning to work is usually equivalent to returning to work to any extent, and our outcome is being on sick leave to any extent. Furthermore, we included working‐age individuals and excluded individuals who might not participate actively in the workforce, that is, patients who had received pension or had a high burden of sick leave in the period preceding the inclusion. Apart from the difference mentioned above in return to work and sick leave outcomes, there are two main reasons for different levels of sick leave between studies: (1) a registry‐based study like ours is not burdened with the lower follow‐up rate in the sickest patients seen in cohort studies with individual follow‐up; (2) the social security systems differ on sick leave. The Swedish healthcare system is generous, rendering sick leave a viable option for patients with remaining functional impairment. Based on the ordinal logistic models, we assessed the mean difference in sick leave‐free days alive before and after adjustment for confounding, unraveling substantial confounding where the difference was overestimated in the crude numbers. Moreover, in two binary logistic models, we studied the risk of being on sick leave 1 year after inclusion among surviving individuals. The ICU patients, compared to both the hospital patients and the population controls, had considerably higher odds for this outcome, reflecting the crude differences observed and the findings on the ordinal models. As the outcome measures days alive, the burden of not attaining functional recovery has to be added to the existing burden of short‐term mortality in patients discharged from hospital or ICU. Also, these outcomes are added to the burden of invasive and painful procedures, especially in patients admitted to ICU.",
            "This work has some limitations. We did not have control over the original data collection process, but we used high‐quality registries with very high to complete coverage of the Swedish ICUs, specialist care, and the Swedish population. The sickness certification process is influenced by factors such as the prescriber's experience, and setting [37]. It can be assumed that these influences are comparable across the groups. We did not have access to actual return to work for the included individuals. However, according to the SSIA, 96% of individuals return to work at the end of a sick leave period making sick leave‐free days a relevant surrogate for functional recovery [24]. Another limitation is that the general population controls had COVID‐19 at low, but increasing rates over the study period [38]. The actual infection levels in the population controls are impossible to know, given that the testing capacity during the initial wave was minimal for the general public. We excluded patients with extensive sick leave before inclusion because of the strong correlation between sick leave and future sick leave and ill health [39, 40]. By doing so we introduced some level of confounding by selection bias, however, it was deemed that this selection was necessary. Another source of selection bias is the inclusion at hospital discharge which selects patients with shorter, before those with longer, hospital length of stay. However, this was inevitable to address the bias from sick leave during the hospital stay. Finally, although the proportion of individuals on sick leave is not generalizable outside Sweden our findings on impeded recovery are generalizable.",
            "Our study has several strengths. The use of governmental registries to which reporting is governed by law and a high‐ranking national ICU registry to capture the exposure makes it equally unlikely that our findings are caused by exposure or outcome misclassification. Moreover, although the decision to prescribe sick leave is up to the individual physician and thus possibly biased, physicians use support documents from the SSIA. Additionally, all sick leave certifications must be approved by case officers at the SSIA. Importantly, any potential bias is likely evenly distributed across the groups under study. Furthermore, we report low frequencies of missing data, and we could use a reliable method of imputing to avoid selection bias from the exclusion of participants from the logistic models. Additionally, we were able to control for the expected baseline differences in socioeconomic variables between the ICU patients, hospital patients, and population controls. Finally, although we acquired the data retrospectively, they were collected prospectively to the registries, which removes the risk of recall bias.",

            "The world is fuming at SARS-CoV-2 for being the culprit for causing the devastating COVID-19, claiming millions of lives across the globe in the form of respiratory disorders. But lesser known are its effects on the CNS that are slowly surfacing in the worldwide population. Our review illustrates findings that claim SARS-CoV-2's arrival onto the ACE2 receptors of neuronal and glial cells mainly via CSF, olfactory nerve, trigeminal nerve, neuronal dissemination, and hematogenous pathways. The role of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in its smooth viral infectivity of the host cannot be ignored, especially the spike proteins that mediate spike attachment and host membrane fusion. Worth mentioning the nucleocapsid, envelope, and membrane proteins make the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 much simpler than expected in spreading infection. This has led to catastrophic conditions like seizures, Guillain-Barré syndrome, viral encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, acute cerebrovascular disease, and respiratory failures. Placing a magnifying lens on the lesser-explored CNS consequences of COVID-19, we attempt to shift the focus of our readers onto the new supporting threats to which further studies are needed.",
            "Unlabelled Image",
            "The journey of a virus causing respiratory illness that began in December 2019 has now brought us in the middle of a pandemic claiming the lives of nearly one million as of September 2020. In the beginning, having infected a lot of countries, it has now granted its mercy on a few while other countries are still in the battle with the virus. The virus termed officially by World Health Organization (WHO) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on January 11, 2020, is known to cause COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19), a disease responsible for respiratory disorders across the world [1,2]. Usually, these respiratory disorders could include breathlessness, pneumonia, and ultimately acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) defined by pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, and reduction in the size of the aerated lungs [3,4].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 contains a positive-sense single strand of RNA virus of 29,903 base pairs which belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus in the Coronaviridae family [5]. About ten open reading frames (ORF) are present in their genome. ORF1a/b translates for polyprotein 1a, polyprotein 1b, and 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs) [6]. The remaining genome codes for structural proteins and accessory proteins [7]. The structural proteins present in SARS-CoV-2 include Spike proteins, Nucleocapsid proteins, Membrane proteins, and Envelope proteins i.e. S, N, M, and E protein respectively [8]. The S protein promotes viral attachment and membrane fusion, N protein in replication of the virus in the host organism, E protein in forming viroporins essential for viral assembly and release, and M protein in virus assembly and budding [9,10].",
            "The SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) mediated priming of S protein subunits S1 and S2 cause activation of ACE2 receptors that enhance the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 virions and its membrane fusion with target cells [11,12]. In the initial stages of infection, it is primarily known to affect the respiratory system where the infected patients showed symptoms ranging from breathlessness to ARDS[13].",
            "Interestingly, current reports say that SARS-CoV-2 virions have managed to evade into the brain as well, one reason could be due to the distribution of ACE2 receptors in the brain. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are found in high proportions in precursor cells of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes residing in substantia nigra and cortex and also in the endothelial cells of cerebral capillaries and this cerebral vascular network helps SARS-CoV-2 to gain access in the central nervous system (CNS) [14]. It is also speculated that it may enter the CNS via olfactory or neuron mediated dissemination, creating a scope for evaluating other possible routes in the CNS [15]. A recent study highlights various neurological manifestations in patients like encephalopathy, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), anosmia, acute cerebrovascular disease, etc. that have resulted as a consequence of COVID-19 [16].",
            "Hence, it is now evident that SARS-CoV-2 could infect the CNS and lead to its numerous complications. Therefore, it is vital to understand the pieces of evidence for the entry of SARS-CoV-2, possible routes through which SARS-CoV-2 may enter into the CNS, potential interaction of structural proteins, and the neurological conditions that may follow and thus, our review attempts to chalk out the same.",
            "The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in the brain is produced in the walls of the ventricles by a network of blood capillaries called choroid plexuses. Eighty percent of proteins in the CSF are derived from peripheral blood, and the cells of the CNS synthesize and release the rest of the CSF proteome. Hence, any cellular and biochemical changes of the brain may perhaps leave a mark in the CSF. Therefore, analyzing if SARS-CoV-2 exists in the CSF may explain the ability of neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2. The CSF of a COVID-19 patient with encephalitis showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Of note, hyperintensity along the right ventricle wall and abnormal findings in the hippocampus were observed [17]. In a case report, a patient showed neurological symptoms of demyelinating disease and upon subjecting to a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the CSF sample was found positive for SARS-CoV-2 [18]. Recently, Cebrian and colleagues identified SARS-CoV-2 located in the patient's CSF who presented symptoms like headache and impaired consciousness [19]. In a retrospective study to evaluate the neuroimaging outcomes in extreme COVID-19 patients, the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was identified in the CSF [20].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 antibodies develop rapidly after infection (Fig. 1\n). Thus, an immune-mediated nervous system impairment may occur after a viral infection. Supporting this, the CSF of two patients having COVID-19 encephalopathy showed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), SARS-CoV-2 S and N protein antigens were detected [21]. The SARS-CoV-2 S proteins have a short intracellular C fragment, transmembrane moiety, and ectodomain element. In the ectodomain, the S1 component facilitates the receptor binding and S2 facilitates membrane fusion by stimulating adhesion to the cells and enhancing the spreading of the virus to the non-infected cells [8]. These antibodies may stimulate the glial cells leading to neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation may lead to the production of cytokines and oxidative stress [22,23].Fig. 1The development of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after its infection in the CSF.Fig. 1",
            "The development of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after its infection in the CSF.",
            "In COVID-19 infected patients that show neurologic symptoms, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF provided the proof for the invasion of the virus into the CNS. However, retrospective screening of 578 CSF samples in COVID-19 patients showed negative results for SARS-CoV-2. The study was performed in the general population, and the authors concluded that in such cases, the testing of SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF is not essential [24]. Furthermore, in COVID-19 induced meningitis, encephalitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, the SARS-CoV-2's existence in CSF was not detected [[25], [26], [27]]. Whether these neurologic symptoms are expressed in a specific group of COVID-19 infected patients requires exploration and added documentation in large cohorts of patients. An increasing number of research teams have screened SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid, with discrepant findings. Since the analysis of CSF has been carried out with different methods across different laboratories, the test quality criteria, reliability and reproducibility differ [[18], [19], [20]]. The technical problems of lumbar puncture is a significant drawback in the collection of CSF biomarkers. Further, the differential diagnosis between neurological disorders presenting with COVID-19 also poses a diagnostic challenge. In COVID-19 patients, neurological symptoms may arise several days after the entry of SARS-CoV-2 [27]. CSF may have a low viral load as the projected incubation period is five days and taking in to account the time between infection and sample collection [[25], [26], [27]]. Thus, in more subjects with neurological manifestations, the CSF SARS-CoV-2 assay needs to be validated. Due to the less understanding regarding probable neurologic complications in COVID-19, there is an urgent need for CSF studies connecting definite cases and neuropathological outcomes.",
            "Anosmia and hyposmia, the lack of ability, or diminished ability to smell have been recognized as an early symptom of COVID-19. Lately, multiple studies investigated the prevalence and clinical outcomes of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients [28,29]. Given the olfactory route may provide easy access to CNS, the prospect that SARS-CoV-2 could access the CNS through this route cannot be denied. With a growing number of clinical studies aimed to detect the association between olfactory route and neurotropism in COVID-19 infected individuals, the concept of the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 has become more and more elusive.",
            "The olfactory epithelium consists of olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) initiating the olfactory response. Cilia that project from the dendrite of olfactory sensory neurons make it accessible for the virus to infect neurons [30]. Axons of OSN extend through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone [31]. These bundles of axons constitute the right and left olfactory nerve which terminates in the olfactory bulbs of the brain [32] (Fig. 2\n). The entry of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the binding affinity of S protein to the ACE2 receptor followed by TMPRSS2 activity [33]. Analysis of multiple scRNA- seq datasets found a high population of ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 in the goblet and nasal mucosal cells lined by cilia [34]. In the golden Syrian hamster model, nasal instillation of two strains of SARS-CoV-2 (UCN1 and UCN19) caused damage in the olfactory epithelium, loss of OSN cilia, and intrusion of immune cells in the olfactory epithelium [35].Fig. 2The entry of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS via the olfactory sensory neurons.Fig. 2",
            "The entry of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS via the olfactory sensory neurons.",
            "In thirty-two COVID-19 autopsy cases, the highest amount of SARS-CoV-2 was identified in the olfactory mucosa underneath the cribriform plate, olfactory bulb, trigeminal ganglion, and medulla oblongata [36]. Nevertheless, MRI evaluation showed bilateral olfactory bulb edema in an asymptomatic health worker diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, who later experienced anosmia and dysgeusia [37]. Ultrastructural analysis of the olfactory nerve, gyrus rectus, and brain stem of COVID-19 patient revealed damage to nerve axons, glia, and myelin sheath. Further, the virions of SARS-CoV-2 were identified in these anatomic regions [38]. Supporting this, brain MRI studies in COVID-19 patients suggests injury to the olfactory bulb following the SARS-CoV-2 attack [39,40].",
            "Mechanisms of neuronal complications linked with COVID-19 could be due to SARS-CoV-2 invasion of trigeminal nerve sensory axons from the mucosa of the nose. Recently, neuronal cell loss and degeneration of axon in the trigeminal nerve was observed in the autopsy of six COVID-19 patients [41]. However, whether these observations are due to an immune response or direct infiltration of the virus could not be established [41,42]. The sensory axons from three branches of the trigeminal nerve, namely ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular nerve enter the trigeminal ganglion and terminate in nuclei in the pons (Fig. 3\n). High levels of SARS-CoV-2 were found in trigeminal ganglion following an autopsy in COVID-19 infected patients [36]. Another interesting feature of the SARS-CoV-2- trigeminal nerve interaction is the connectivity of the trigeminal pathway to the caudal brain regions and respiratory nuclei. This supports the notion that SARS-CoV-2 could damage the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) (Fig. 3) leading to microvascular clotting, pulmonary edema, and cytokine storm in COVID-19 affected patients [41].Fig. 3Nucleus tractus solitarius infection by SARS-CoV-2 via the trigeminal nerve pathway.Fig. 3",
            "Nucleus tractus solitarius infection by SARS-CoV-2 via the trigeminal nerve pathway.",
            "The CNS can be affected by the respiratory viruses in case of insufficient peripheral immune clearance leading to a subsequent increase of viral load in the blood through a process termed as viremia. [32]. Via this hematogenous route, it can cause infection of blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells or epithelium of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSF) in the ventricles (Fig. 1) [43]. The viruses can also gain access to the CNS via paracellular transmigration occurring due to disruptions of the tight junctions in BBB (Fig. 4\n) [44]. Once the SARS-CoV-2 enters the bloodstream, it can travel into the cerebral circulation leading to the interaction of S protein with ACE2 receptors in the CNS [45]. ACE2 receptors are found in the neuronal cells and glia that promote CNS invasion of SARS-CoV-2 in CNS [46]. This could be a possible reason for the increase in the levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) which is a biomarker for astrocytic damage and also an increase in the neurofilament light chain, a biomarker for indicating neuronal damage [47]. The patients who were infected with COVID-19 and had CNS symptoms, showed a lesser count of lymphocytes as compared to COVID-19 patients without CNS symptoms. This could be possibly due to the suppression of immunity mediated by SARS-CoV-2 [48]. Other possibilities could be the development of cytokine storm and prevention of upregulation of T cells due to their infection by SARS-CoV-2 [49].Fig. 4The hematogenous route used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect neurons in the CNS.Fig. 4",
            "The hematogenous route used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect neurons in the CNS.",
            "Respiratory viruses also can enter the CNS through retrograde neuronal dissemination by first infecting peripheral neurons followed by axonal transport systems to access the CNS. The CNS neurons are connected to the peripheral organs, which can be used as a point of entry by the viruses that infect sensory or motor nerve endings [50]. The polarized neurons can receive and transfer data. This retrograde or anterograde transport is facilitated by proteins like dynein and kinesin [51]. An increasing number of cases have identified viral particles in peripheral nerves and the current findings elucidating the role of SARS-CoV-2 in several neurological disorders summarized in this paper, augment a converging hypothesis that axonal dissemination plays a critical role in the progression of the disease.",
            "The possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection via the GI route has also grabbed enough attention amongst the COVID-19 cases. This could be due to the abundant presence of ACE2 receptors in the glandular cells of the gastric epithelia, the duodenal epithelia, and even the rectal epithelia [52]. ACE2 receptors have also been traced in the colonic endothelial and vascular smooth muscle. Immunohistology studies have revealed the expression levels of ACE2 receptors in the small intestine [53]. With such an extensive distribution of ACE2 receptors, COVID-19 cases have bridged the connection of disease with the disruption of the digestive system expressed in terms of diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain [54]. This could be a reason for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the fecal samples until 5 weeks after the patients testing negative for the upper respiratory swab samples [54,55]. GI tract is connected to the central nervous system through the enteric neuronal network regulated by the vagus nerve and sympathetic nerve. Certainly, the enteric invasion of SARS-CoV-2 may alter the blood and lymphatic system. Interestingly, in the report of Chen et.al, COVID-19 patients reported positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples were clogged at around 67% [56]. Similarly, Xiao et.al reported approximately 54% of such cases suggesting the secretion of the viral particles from the GI cells [57], while Park et.al reported close to 4% of COVID-19 cases tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces [58]. Therefore, even though such high variabilities in the reports exists, these findings are essential to project towards the prospective audience in-order to arrive at a clearer conclusion since the exact mechanism is yet to be illuminated.",
            "The SARS-CoV-2 that possess structural proteins namely S proteins, N proteins, E proteins, and M proteins play a crucial role in determining the entry, incorporation, and proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 virions in the host body [8]. The structure of S protein appears like a crown due to which the virus is characteristically named as coronavirus [59]. ACE2 type receptors are widely populated in endothelia of arteries, veins, arterial smooth muscles, Type I and Type II alveolar epithelial cells, squamous epithelium of nasal and oral mucosa, and the vessels of the small intestine and colon [60]. A recent study conducted using human pluripotent stem cells (PSC) -obtained mixed neurons concluded that ACE2 is highly expressed in neuronal cell bodies and lesser in the axons and the dendrites [61]. Further, Zhang and colleagues demonstrated the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect the neural progenitor cells [62]. SARS-CoV-2 may gain access to CNS through routes like the olfactory nerve, trigeminal nerve, neuronal dissemination, or hematogenous route to present its neuroinvasive potential as mentioned before in Section 2. The SARS-CoV-2's S protein possesses a 10–20 fold greater binding potential with ACE2 receptors as compared to SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) S protein. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit transforms to enhance virus and ACE2 receptor binding [63]. This transforms S2 to a post-fusion mode [64]. The TMPRSS II are co-expressed with ACE2 receptors and play an essential role in priming and activation of S proteins that helps in membrane fusion [65]. The sustentacular cells of the olfactory epithelium help in the sensing of odor and olfactory neuron metabolism and express a high amount of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 can target these cells to ultimately reach the CNS causing olfactory system failures [66]. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 S protein may associate with ACE2 receptors at multiple sites where it is co-expressed with TMPRSS2 to promote neuroinvasion as shown in Fig. 5\n.Fig. 5Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with ACE2 receptors at multiple sites to facilitate CNS damage.Fig. 5",
            "Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with ACE2 receptors at multiple sites to facilitate CNS damage.",
            "The N protein is present in high amounts at the start of the infection and plays a role in viral replication in the host body [67]. The N protein present in SARS-CoV-2 has about 90% similarity to the SARS-CoV N proteins [68]. The peculiar feature of N protein is that it binds to the SARS-CoV RNA and packs them into a ribonucleoprotein complex [69]. The N protein contains N Terminal Domain (NTD), a Serine Rich (SR) linker region, and a C Terminal Domain (CTD). The NTD facilitates RNA binding while the SR rich linker promotes phosphorylation, and the CTD helps in oligomerization [70].",
            "The E proteins are small proteins important in viral replication. They form small hydrophobic viroporins important in viral assembly and release. Along with these functions, they also facilitate cytotoxicity and pathogenic pathways [71]. The E proteins also play an important role in neuronal propagation, neuronal virulence, and its degeneration [72]. The E proteins also increase inflammatory responses in the host, thus enhancing the inflammation-mediated effects in hosts [73]. The M protein is the most abundant protein present in the coronaviruses [74]. It associates with the E protein to facilitate the attachment of S protein over its surface. The long-form of M proteins bends to create an enclosed membrane over the ribonucleoprotein [75]. Therefore, such synergistic functions of all the structural proteins in SARS-CoV-2 encourage its infectivity in target cells.",
            "Generally, seizures involve changes in the neurological function due to high discharge from neurons in the brain while recurrent seizures are named epilepsy. They are broadly classified into partial and generalized seizures and are characterized by loss of attention, impaired or loss of consciousness, reduced skeletal muscle contractions, etc. [76]. Patients with COVID-19 manifest seizures since the earliest stage of the disease. In a multicenter retrospective study, Lu and colleagues have evaluated the incidence and risk of seizures in 304 COVID-19 patients in China, including Hubei province, the epicenter of COVID-19 in China. The patients enrolled did not have a previous history of seizure. Seizures were observed in eighty- four cases (27%). They identified hypoxia as the most common risk factor for seizure in COVID-19 patients. However, the study suggests no indication of the risk of seizures in COVID-19 affected patients [77]. On the other hand, Galanapoulou et al. in a case series of retrospective nature found that seizures were seen in COVID-19 patients and EEG investigations showed frontal sharp waves suggesting sporadic epileptic abnormalities. A frontal epileptogenic dysfunction observed may be correlated with the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into the brain through the olfactory route [78]. A body of evidence has been formed, proposing that the COVID-19 may lead to neurologic complications [[79], [80], [81]]. Others have confirmed the notion that seizures could be an early manifestation of the SARS-CoV-2 attack [82,83].",
            "Fasano et al. describe a case of focal motor seizure and Vollono and colleagues report focal status epilepticus as a presenting symptom of COVID-19. Interestingly, the body temperature of these patients was normal, and the SARS-CoV-2 infection did not show any pulmonary involvement [84,85]. In a sub febrile patient, Elgamasy and colleagues found that recurrent focal seizures could be an early manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 encroachment [86]. However, to prove the invasion of the virus to CNS, the analysis of CSF for SARS-CoV-2 was not performed in these studies. Further, a study reporting a case of generalized-tonic clonic seizure and convulsive syncope due to autonomic dysfunction in patients later were found to have COVID-19, has supported this opinion. CSF samples analyzed did not reveal the presence of SARS-CoV-2 [87,88]. Interestingly, COVID-19 was seen to aggravate epilepsy in 18% of people who were already having epilepsy and the number of seizures were greater during the COVID-19 phase in comparison to the non-COVID-19 phase [89]. Yet, it is still unclear whether COVID-19 amplifies epilepsy or not [77]. Although these studies suggest that seizure might be an initial symptom associated with SARS-CoV-2, additional studies with larger samples are required in this regard.",
            "The GBS is an autoimmune neurologic disease of the peripheral nervous system caused by an infection of mainly the gastrointestinal or respiratory system leading to an autoimmune response towards antigens that cause demyelination and injury to the axons [90]. It is characterized by areflexia in the limbs, bilateral weakness in the facial muscles, bladder or bowel dysfunction, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, acute motor axonal neuropathy, etc. [91]. Viral epidemics such as the Zika virus, middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV have triggered GBS [[92], [93], [94]]. Evidence proposes that through a resemblance of epitope mechanism, a cellular and humoral immune response to the virus is misdirected to host nerve tissue leading to GBS [95]. GBS is one of the neurological disorders in COVID-19 patients that causes many negative consequences for patients. Studies of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with GBS are summarized in Table 1\n.Table 1Studies evaluating SARS-CoV-2 in CSF and antiganglioside antibodies in COVID-19 patients diagnosed with GBSTable 1StudyType of studyNo. of casesGBS diagnosisRT-PCR assay SARS-CoV-2 in CSFAnti-ganglioside antibodiesTreatment[27]Case Series5Clinical +CSF+ Electrophysiology + Nerve conductionNegative3 negative;2 not testedIVIG[106]Case Series14Clinical+ CSFNegativeNot testedIVIG and Plasma-pheresis[107]Case Report1Clinical+ CSF+ Electrophysiology + Nerve conductionNegativeNegativeIVIG[108]Case Report1Clinical+ CSF+ Nerve conductionNegativeNegativeIVIG[109]Case Report1Clinical+ CSF+ Nerve conductionNegativeNegativeIVIG[26]Case report1Clinical+ CSF+ Nerve conductionNegativeNegativeIVIG[110]Case Report1Clinical+ CSF+ Electrophysiology + Nerve conductionNegativeNot testedIVIG[111]Case Report1Clinical+ CSF+ Electrophysiology + Nerve conductionNegativeNot testedIVIG[112]Case Report1Clinical+ CSF+ Nerve conductionNegativeNot testedIVIG[113]Case Report1Clinical+ CSFNegativeNot testedLow dose prednisolone[114]Case Report1Clinical+ CSF+ Electrophysiology + Nerve conductionNegativeNegativeIVIGHydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin[115]Case Report1Clinical+ CSF+ Electrophysiology + Nerve conductionNot performedNegativePlasma exchange",
            "Studies evaluating SARS-CoV-2 in CSF and antiganglioside antibodies in COVID-19 patients diagnosed with GBS",
            "The GBS diagnosis was based on clinical, CSF, electrophysiology, and nerve conduction studies. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was injected in most of the studies. Yet, plasmapheresis was considered in two cases. Out of these cases, eleven studies used RT-PCR assay of the CSF to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2. However, the test was negative for SARS-CoV-2. Further, the absence of antibodies against gangliosides was observed in nine studies (Table 1). While these observations may primarily support the hypothesis that the disease itself may perhaps predispose patients with COVID-19 to GBS, the interpretation of these studies is complicated by the effect of SARS-CoV-2, which might differentially modulate the nervous system in COVID-19 patients with and without GBS. Several pieces of evidence point to the hypothesis that exposure of SARS-CoV-2 to the nervous system may result in abnormal activation of the immune system [96]. It has been proposed that viruses might provoke GBS by occupying glycoconjugates. Glycoconjugates, particularly gangliosides, are the neural targets for viruses [97]. As an attachment factor for cell entry, SARS-CoV-2 uses sialic acids [98]. The S proteins mediate the association and access of virions in target cells, and it has two components, namely the S1 subunit and S2 subunit as mentioned previously in Section 3. Sialic acids are linked to gangliosides [99]. Several gangliosides contribute to communications between axons and glia, receptor signal transduction, and growth [100]. Gangliosides usually are present on the plasma membrane of cells, rendering them vulnerable to an antibody-mediated attack [97]. It has been revealed how SARS-CoV-2 may disrupt the inflammatory cytokine system causing cytokine storm in COVID-19 [101]. This suggests that COVID-19 patients, in general possibly will be predisposed to neurological disorders like GBS [102,103]. Nevertheless, we would take into the reason that only a lesser number of COVID-19 patients develop GBS [104,105]. Therefore, more studies are desirable to evaluate the difference between COVID-19 patients who do develop GBS and the rest of the COVID-19 population.",
            "Encephalitis is an inflammation occurring in the brain that results in a neurological dysfunction due to infection or autoimmunity [91]. Generally, patients present with low levels of consciousness, seizures, fever, arthralgia, GI symptoms, and even respiratory malfunctions [116]. It is also characterized by the presence of inflammatory lesions in the brain parenchyma and is a clinical feature of COVID-19 sometimes coexisting with meningitis [117,118]. Even though this is an uncommon manifestation; there are reports of patients with COVID-19 diagnosed with encephalitis [118,119]. The underlying mechanisms responsible for encephalitis in SARS-CoV-2 are still debated. Classically, SARS-CoV-2 affects the respiratory system and cardiovascular system largely. Nevertheless, taking into deliberation the fact that encephalitis is present in SARS-CoV-2 infection at comparatively early stages when the central neuronal pathway is considered relatively spared, the other organ systems being involved may not be the only responsible. Viral intrusion into the CSF of a SARS-CoV-2 patient admitted for encephalitis has supported this hypothesis [120]. Currently, some authors have proposed that encephalitis might be the result of anti-NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor antibodies, causing functional disruption of glutamatergic signaling in the CNS [121]. On this point, it was suggested that immunologic responses in the brain, by influencing the glial system might lead to neuroinflammation and consequently encephalitis [3,122,123]. However, the observation that the presence of ACE2 receptor in the vascular endothelium which often correlates with clotting and infarction suggests an involvement of other mechanisms as well [124].",
            "The meningoencephalitis occurs due to the inflammation of the meninges and the brain. It is evident by the symptoms like neck muscle rigidity, high temperatures, and headache probably due to meningeal inflammation. It could even cause inflammation in the brain parenchyma leading to cortical dysfunction and aphasia along with hemiparesis [125]. COVID-19 is associated with meningoencephalitis [25,126]. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the CSF of a COVID-19 infected patient with meningoencephalitis [17]. The absence of an effective host immune defense system in the CSF allows pathogens to multiply rapidly. A paucity of complement proteins and immunoglobulins in the CSF prevents the phagocytosis of pathogens [127]. The common MRI findings described are white matter hyperintensities, the abnormal findings of the medial temporal lobe, and sulcus hemorrhage. Several observations have been suggested to explain the meningoencephalitis phenomena in COVID-19 patients. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, ferritin, and high protein levels in CSF without pleocytosis may all be considered potential reasons [117]. The inflammatory response induced by the invading virus is a critical result of the pathogenesis of viral meningitis. Most of the neurologic manifestations of meningoencephalitis result from an immune-mediated reaction to the assaulting virus [127].",
            "ACVD includes the diseases of the cerebral blood vessels, the flow of the cerebral blood, and the supply of oxygen to cerebral regions. Its main indication is the ischemic stroke that is caused due to blockage of cerebral blood flow and thus reduced oxygen supply [128]. The patients with severe COVID-19 infection are suspected of having ACVD, possibly due to higher D-dimer levels than non-severe COVID-19 patients [48]. During the activation of the coagulation system, a peptide degradation product is found circulating in the bloodstream named D-dimer. Higher levels of D-dimer in the systemic circulation could hint about higher changes of thrombosis, leading to stroke [129]. A recent study reported that COVID-19 patients could experience such activation of the coagulation system along with the increase in markers like hypersensitive C reactive protein (hsCRP), procalcitonin (PCT), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), and D-dimer levels [130]. A systematic review by Sakka et al. showed that six studies that enrolled COVID-19 patients were grouped as survivors and non-survivors and interestingly the non-survivors exhibited high D-dimer levels, thus correlating to the cause of mortality in such patients [131]. Zhang et al. also showed that high D-dimer levels in COVID-19 patients could also be associated with a greater incidence of ischemic stroke as compared to hemorrhagic stroke [129]. Recently a study involving a comparison of older and comparatively younger COVID-19 infected patients showed that increased inflammatory response, neutrophil count, CRP levels, and D-dimer levels but lower lymphocyte count were exhibited by the older age group implying that older patients could be at higher risk of ACVD [132]. SARS-CoV-2 besides affecting ACE2 receptors in lung cells may also infect ACE2 receptors on endothelial cells causing endothelitis that could throw a light on the damage to microcirculation in vascular groups leading to ACVD [133]. Still, the exact mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 mediates the risk of ACVD is unknown, thus demanding further studies.",
            "Respiratory failure is caused mainly due to the improper functioning of the pump of respiratory muscle or lung dysfunction. While the cases of respiratory pump failure mainly include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, the conditions of lung damage arise in ARDS patients [134]. Animal studies have shown that SARS-CoV particles could gain entry into the brain via olfactory nerves and disseminate into the brain stem and even thalamus [135]. Interestingly, ACE2 receptors have been mapped in regions of the brainstem, in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS), and also in the rostral ventrolateral medulla [136]. The nucleus of the solitary tract in combination with nucleus ambigus together controls the inhalation and exhalation processes in the host [137]. The respiratory tract and lung regions contain mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors that transmit sensory data into the solitary tract nucleus and nucleus ambigus and the innervations of efferent fibers arising from both leads into the respiratory system [138]. SARS-CoV-2 possibly travel towards the solitary tract nucleus neurons in the medulla oblongata and cause damage to the rhythmic respiration and action potentials in neurons which regulate processes of inspiration and expiration [139]. The brain stem contains a primary oscillator named as pre-Botzinger complex (PBC) which is the most crucial player in respiration. It also contains the retrotrapezoid nucleus or the parafacial respiratory group (RTN/pFRG) as the secondary oscillator. It is speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could penetrate the CNS and infect PBC [140]. This could lead to cardio-respiratory impairments responsible for causing ARDS in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients causing respiratory failure [141].",
            "COVID-19 has resulted in millions of deaths across the world. During its initial outbreak, we were only aware of its peripheral symptoms like fever, headache, cough, respiratory difficulties, loss of appetite, diarrhea, etc. Neurological disorders such as seizures, viral encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, acute cerebrovascular disease, and respiratory failure are quite common and represent a significant problem in the management of COVID-19 patients. In the last few months, several efforts have been made to clarify the role of the nervous system in these complications. Nevertheless, the results of the above studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has infiltrated into the CNS through various routes. Upon the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to the ACE2 receptor, it enters the host and starts proliferating. CSF is an excellent marker of changes in CNS and accessing the CSF could be indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in CNS. While the role of the nervous system has been proposed, nevertheless, the complexity of neuronal networks prevents a clear understanding of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the various neurological symptoms. Currently, less focus lies on the CNS manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 as comparatively lesser cases are being evaluated in this direction. Even though certain findings have reported such conditions in COVID-19 patients, the exact mechanism of CNS infection remains speculative, and further study is necessary to draw concrete conclusions regarding COVID-19 and its effects on CNS.",

            "SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the lungs via the ACE2 receptor but also other organs including the kidneys, the gastrointestinal tract, the heart, and the skin. SARS-CoV-2 also infects the brain, but the hematogenous route of viral entry to the brain is still not fully characterized. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 traverses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as well as how it affects the molecular functions of the BBB are unclear. In this study, we investigated the roles of the receptors ACE2 and DPP4 in the SARS-CoV-2 infection of the discrete cellular components of a transwell BBB model comprising HUVECs, astrocytes, and pericytes. Our results demonstrate that direct infection on the BBB model does not modulate paracellular permeability. Also, our results show that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes clathrin and caveolin-mediated endocytosis to traverse the BBB, resulting in the direct infection of the brain side of the BBB model with a minimal endothelial infection. In conclusion, the BBB is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple ways, including the direct infection of endothelium, astrocytes, and pericytes involving ACE2 and/or DPP4 and the blood-to-brain transcytosis, which is an event that does not require the presence of host receptors.",
            "SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, has provisional counts of over 110 million documented cases and 1.218 million deaths in the United States since January 2020 [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/COVID19/index.htm (accessed on 28 February 2024)]. SARS-CoV-2 is an airborne respiratory virus that primarily infects the lungs via the ACE2 receptor but has well-documented secondary target organs including the kidneys, the gastrointestinal tract, the heart, the skin, and the brain [1]. While there is consensus that the brain is affected by the virus, the route of neuroinvasion remains controversial [2,3,4]. The two primary hypotheses are: (1) direct neuronal infection utilizing retrograde axonal transport via the cribiform plate and the olfactory bulb, and (2) transport into the brain across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via active or passive transport mechanisms. While these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, the weight of evidence for the latter exceeds the former as the pandemic has progressed [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the BBB is crucial to understanding the long-term effects that the pandemic will have on human health, as well as helping better prepare for future outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 or different emergent coronaviruses.",
            "The BBB is the cellular and molecular interface between the blood and the brain. It regulates the flow of nutrients, toxins, pathogens, and metabolic byproducts between the blood and the brain required for maintaining homeostasis [13]. At the cellular level, the BBB comprises (i) brain endothelial cells, which form the vascular lumen and are the primary interface for the BBB, (ii) pericytes, a stellate-like cell embedded in the basement membrane that wraps its processes around the endothelium and shares cytoplasm through gap junctions, and (iii) the end-feet of astrocytes which envelop 99.9% of the endothelium [14]. The BBB is characterized by several unique features including: highly impermeable intercellular tight junctions, highly active efflux pumps and an increased expression of transporters responsible for transporting homeostatically necessary nutrients at a seconds notice (e.g., GLUT1, ABC family transporters, amino acid transporters, etc.) [15,16,17,18]. Importantly, the brain endothelium phenotype is an induced phenotype that is mainly derived from signals received from pericytes and astrocytes [19,20,21,22]. This is an important feature of the BBB in the context of understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection since several groups have published on monocellular or bicellular models of the BBB [6,11,23], or iPSC-derived models [24,25,26]. Each of these lacks the intricate tri-directional signaling involved in BBB generation and maintenance or is artificially induced in the case of iPSC organoids, resulting in BBB models that are less representative of the in vivo phenotype, in addition to producing less translatable results.",
            "Canonical SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs in the lungs through ACE2 anchoring and TMPRSS2-mediated cell membrane fusion initiated by cleavage between the S1/S2 peptides within the spike protein of the virus [27,28,29]. A logical extension of this knowledge is that SARS-CoV-2 will infect the BBB in the same way. However, clinical and postmortem studies remain inconsistent and inconclusive. Several studies have found ACE2 expression within the brain vasculature of glioblastomas [30], demonstrating a low total expression of ACE2 transcripts [31,32]. TMPRSS2 is further confounded with studies showing a wide variability in the expression of the transmembrane protease within the brain endothelium [32,33,34]. Lastly, some clinical postmortem studies have found that SARS-CoV-2 does make its way into the brain [12,33,35,36,37,38,39], yet the mechanistic avenue of hematogenous neuroinvasion remains elusive. Several groups have discovered that free spike protein is involved in disrupting tight junctions [40,41], and can be actively transported into the brain of mice [10], yet the understanding of intact viral interactions with the human primary cells of BBB is less well-characterized.",
            "Coronaviridae family infections in polarized cells have a feature that groups do not reconcile with some interpretations of the data—when coronaviruses infect polarized cells, they are secreted from the same side where the infection occurred (i.e., luminal infection results in the luminal release of new virions) [42,43,44,45,46,47]. The tension with this information is such that, if the endothelium of the BBB is directly infected, the virions will mature and exit into the lumen of the vasculature. Thus, understanding the requisite host features for the direct infection of cellular subtypes of the BBB as well as the differential cellular machinery producing transcellular movements remains incomplete.",
            "While it is known that ACE2 is involved in infection, many studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 has features of receptor promiscuity that allow it to bind and infect using other receptors including neuropilin-1 [24,48,49], and alternate hypothesized receptors include Basigin [50], ASGR1, KREMEN1 [51], CD209 [52] and DPP4 (the primary receptor for MERS-CoV) [25,53]. This receptor promiscuity is also theorized as a means for how SARS-CoV-2 has been so successful in transmission as well as an explanatory feature for how the virus has been found in so many disparate tissues within postmortem studies [35,54]. It has been shown that astrocytes express DPP4, however, the group was unable to directly demonstrate DPP4’s role in direct infection [25].",
            "The final component of SARS-CoV-2 infection is concerned with the protease(s) responsible for S1/S2 cleavage, thereby initiating virus-membrane fusion. Canonically, TMPRSS2 is the protease responsible for infection within the lungs [29,55,56] yet SARS-CoV-2 has been found in tissues that do not express TMPRSS2 leading to the discovery of secondary proteases involved in the S1/S2 cleavage within cells as opposed to the surface fusion TMPRSS2 is involved in. Alternative proteases include: furin [27,28,57] (secreted, as well as expressed within the trans-Golgi body) [57,58], CTSB, and CTSL (both constitutively expressed within the endosomal/lysosomal compartments of cells) [32,59,60]. Knowing these other proteases are expressed within organelles allows for two distinct methods of direct infection by SARS-CoV-2—cell surface membrane fusion and the release of viral RNA, or internalization, transport to the endosome/lysosome, and then viral-endosome fusion releasing viral RNA [61,62].",
            "We hypothesize that the triumvirate of cells that comprise the BBB are both directly infected as well as involved in actively mediating the transcytosis of SARS-CoV-2 into the brain. We assessed the susceptibility of individual BBB cells (HUVEC, primary astrocytes, primary pericytes) to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as understanding their susceptibility in a transwell model of the BBB. Our results show the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the BBB molecular mechanism involving paracellular permeability and transcytosis machinery that appears to function independently of direct infection. Collectively, these data suggest that the hematogenous neuroinvasion occurs independently of SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 anchoring.",

            "Transparent PET, 0.4 µM pore Transwell inserts were obtained for 6-well (Cat. No. 83.3930.041), 12-well (Cat. No. 83.3931.041), and 24-well (Cat. No. 83.3932.041) plate applications from Sarstedt AG & Co. KG (Numbrecht, Germany). When using the transwell cell culture experimental design, HUVECs are seeded in the upper compartment of the transwell at enough cells to be 100% confluent the next day (1 × 106 cells/well in 6 well, 4 × 105 cells/well in 12 well, and 2 × 105 in 24 well), and a 1:1 ratio of astrocytes to pericytes at 50% confluency are seeded into the lower compartment of the transwell plate.

            "For monolayer infections, cells were seeded at least 24 h prior to infection, and up to 96 h prior to infection for the shLentivirus experiments, to allow the knockdown to take effect. All infections were initiated at 1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) and were ended at 48 h post infection unless otherwise noted utilizing icSARS-CoV-2-mNG (SARS-CoV-2 stably encoding mNeonGreen) provided from Dr. PEI-Yong Shi from the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA [63]. IcSARS-CoV-2 was engineered by inserting a Neon Green reporter gene into ORF7. IcSARS-CoV-2-mNG exhibited no change in titer, plaque morphology, viral RNA profile, and replication kinetics compared to the wild-type virus it was generated from the 2019-nCoV/USA_WA1/2020 strain (GenBank: MT246667.1). For the transwell experiments, HUVECs were seeded at 95% confluency in the upper well and astrocytes and pericytes seeded at 30–40% in the lower well 5 days prior to infection to allow cells to reach confluency and for tight junctions to mature. Infections were conducted overnight, and the media were refreshed first thing the next morning. All experiments were conducted in a BSL-3 environment.",

No. 12259, Addgene, Watertown, MA, USA). First, HEK293T cells were seeded 24 h prior to transfection on a 100mm cell culture dish. Next, plasmids were mixed in 500 µL optiMEM at a ratio of 6.4 µg of target plasmid: 6.4 µg of psPAX2: 3.2 µg pMDG.2 with 32 µL of P3000 reagent (Cat. No. 100022058, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). Since 3 shRNA plasmids were simultaneously used in each transfection, the 6.4 µg of target plasmid was divided by 3 parts equally among the 3 plasmids, i.e., 2.13 µg of each target plasmid. Then, 20 µL of Lipofectamine 3000 (Cat. No. 100022052, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) was added to 500 µL of OptiMEM and then the DNA-P3000 mixture was added to the Lipofectamine 3000 mixture, vortexed for 5 s, and incubated at room temperature for 20 min to ensure complexing. After incubation, the transfection mixture was added gently dropwise to the 100 mm dish containing 5.5 mL OptiMEM and incubated in the cell culture incubator overnight.

Next, the clarified supernatant was moved to a fresh tube and placed in a bucket of ice; the bucket of ice was placed in the 4 °C fridge for the next clarified supernatant harvest. After 16–24 h, the supernatant was harvested again from the transfected HEK293T cells, and centrifugation and clarification steps were repeated. From this point forward, supernatant was maintained at an ice-cold temperature. Clarified supernatants were combined into a single tube and a Lenti-X Concentrator was added to the supernatant at a 4:1 ratio (12 µL of supernatant requires 4 µL of Lenti-X Concentrator). The tube was inverted several times until Lenti-X was fully mixed with the supernatant and placed on ice for at least 15 min. After the incubation was complete, the tube was centrifuged for 45 min at 1500× g and a small white pellet formed; this was the lentivirus. The supernatant was aspirated and the lentiviral pellet was resuspended in 1/10th the supernatant volume with sterile PBS. To ensure a better long-term storage of lentivirus, with minimal loss upon thawing, Lenti-Guard was added at a 1:4 ratio to the PBS (300 µL Lenti-Guard to 1200 µL PBS). Next, the lentivirus was aliquoted into single-use volumes and stored at −80 °C for long-term storage.",
            "During every lentiviral transfection, a concurrent GFP lentivirus was created as a proxy for determining lentiviral infectious units per mL (IU/mL). Briefly, the GFP lentivirus was harvested as previously described, and immediately placed into a 96-well plate of HEK293T cells seeded at 15,000 cells/well for transduction. Each row of the plate was serially diluted with the concentrated GFP lentivirus from 10−1 to 10−6 (10 µL lentivirus into 90 µL OptiMEM). The viral media was then aspirated 24 h later, and replaced with a fresh batch of GFP lentivirus, and 48 h post-transduction the cells were imaged for GFP fluorescence. The green cells are counted and compared to the amount of nonfluorescent cells and IU/mL is calculated using these numbers. Using this IU/mL, the shACE2 and shDPP4 lentivirus are used at 1 IU/mL for knockdown.",

From the stock solutions, the dextrans were diluted in cEM to their working concentrations of 1 µM and 10 µM, respectively. From there, the dextran-spiked media were placed onto the HUVECs in the upper compartment. To measure the dextran pass through, media from the lower compartment is sampled at 1/100th of the total volume at t0 = 0 h, t1 = 24 h, and t2 = 48 h. The media is then collected into a black 96-well plate in triplicate and their respective excitation–emission spectra are read. The readings are averaged and normalized within the bounds of 100% (dextran-spiked cEM) permeability in an empty well, and 0% permeability (t0). Using the permeability coefficient calculation, all coefficients are calculated using area, concentration, and time of sampling using the equation below where Papp is the permeability coefficient, Vbasolateral is the volume of media in the lower well in cm3, ΔCbasolateral is the change in concentration (μM) of dextran in the lower well, Δt is the time in seconds, A is the surface area of the transwell insert, and Capical is the concentration of the dextran-spiked media at t0.\n(1)Papp=Vbasolateral ΔCbasolateralΔtA×Capical",

Each blot was then incubated with a solution of primary antibody (Table 2) at the proper dilution overnight at 4 °C on a side-to-side rocker. After washing the blot three times with TBS-T for 5 min each, the blot was then incubated with the appropriate secondary HRP antibody in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T for 2 h at room temperature. After the secondary antibody incubation, blots were washed three times again in TBS-T for 5 min. Protein bands were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent substrate (Cat. No. 34580, ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and imaged using the ChemiDoc XRS imaging system according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",
            "First, we aimed to determine if the BBB cells were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We exposed a monolayer of each cell type (HUVECs, and primary astrocyte and pericyte) to 1 MOI of icSARS-CoV-2-nMG and monitored the infection via fluorescent live cell imaging and measured productive infection through plaque assays using the supernatant from the mock and infected cells on VERO-TMPRSS2-ACE2 cells. Fluorescent live cell imaging showed a noticeable infection at 24 h, with minor to moderate cell pathology in the overlaid brightfield images (Figure 1A–C). We showed that SARS-CoV-2 produces a small but productive infection in HUVECs (PFUHUVEC = 2025 PFU/mL) and smaller still in astrocytes and pericytes (PFUastrocyte = 1000 PFU/mL, PFUPericyte = 632.5 PFU/mL) (Figure 1D–F).",
            "To examine which host receptor and protease are involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection of the target cell, we infected HUVECs, and primary astrocytes, and pericytes for up to 72 h and collected cells for qPCR analysis. For imaging, we fixed the cells at 48 hpi and immunostained with antibodies to ACE2, DPP4 or spike protein. We found that HUVECs expressed ACE2 (Figure 2A) but not DPP4 (Figure S1) and ACE2 expression did not change after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, spike protein expression was seen upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2A). Moreover, the qPCR data showed that SARS-CoV-2 rapidly infects HUVECs (Figure 2D,E), and mRNA for both N and spike were detected within 24 hpi and were maintained at least until 72 hpi; furthermore, they were significantly different (p < 0.05) compared to their mock counterparts in all three measured time points. We did not see any expression of ACE2 in astrocytes and pericytes (Figure S1), however, these cells expressed DPP4 (Figure 2B,C). Also, N and spike RNA were detected in both astrocytes and pericytes (Figure 2D–I); however, the timeline of detection in astrocytes began at 48 hpi. In pericytes, there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) at 24 hpi. Collectively, the data demonstrate the SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility of each cell type.",
            "Using a lentiviral protocol, we developed three lentiviruses that can knockdown either ACE2 or DPP4 via encapsulating shACE2 or shDPP4 plasmids in HUVECs, and primary astrocytes and pericytes. The corresponding lentivirus encapsulating scrambled sequences were used to develop shScr plasmids that were used as controls. We transduced each cell type with an equivalent of 1 IU/cell for 48 h and assessed the effects of knockdown and potential off-target effects on proteases involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure S1). HUVECs expressed ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSB, and furin, but not DPP4. Further, the transduction of HUVECs with shACE2 lentivirus reduced ACE2, with no other effects on the other proteins measured. Astrocytes did not express ACE2, and transduction of these cells with shDPP4 lentivirus reduced the expression of DPP4 (Figure S1). We also noticed an effect on furin expression, while TMPRSS2 and CTSB exhibited no modulation via lentiviral transduction. Pericytes also did not express ACE2, and we found DPP4 knockdown upon exposure to shDPP4 lentivirus (Figure S1). We also found a slight downregulation effect on furin similar to what we observed in astrocytes.",
            "To determine the effects of ACE2 depletion in HUVECs or DPP4 depletion in astrocytes and pericytes on infection with SARS-CoV-2, we first transduced the shLentiviruses on their respective cells for 48 h at the 1 IU/cell and then infected cells with 1 MOI SARS-CoV-2. Culture supernatants were used for plaque assays and cells were harvested for qPCR or Western blot analysis.",
            "The confirmation of ACE2 depletion in HUVECs (Figure 3A) and DPP4 depletion in astrocytes and pericytes (Figure 3B,C) in shACE2 or shDPP4 transduced cells were confirmed using Western blotting. The treatment with shScr lentivirus in each of these cells did not alter the expression of ACE2 or DPP4. Further, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not increase the expression of ACE2 or DPP4 in these cells. QPCR data suggested that knocking down ACE2 in HUVECs and DPP4 in astrocytes and pericytes resulted in reductions in mRNAs for N and spike proteins compared to naïve cells as well as the shScr lentivirus treated cultures (Figure 3D–F), suggesting decreased productive replication.",
            "This was further confirmed using plaque assays (Figure 3G–I). The analysis of the plaque assay in SARS-CoV-2 infected HUVECs (Figure 3G) suggested that there was a significant reduction in plaques from the naïve vs. shACE2 conditions (p < 0.05). However, there was a nonsignificant difference between the naïve and shScr lentivirus transduced HUVECs, as well as the scramble and shACE2 transduced cultures (p = 0.0506). In SARS-CoV-2 infected astrocytes (Figure 3H), pre-transduction with shDPP4 lentivirus significantly reduced virion production (34 PFU/mL) vs. shScr lentivirus (231 PFU/mL) vs. naïve astrocytes (348 PFU/mL), demonstrating a pronounced effect of DPP4 in permitting a productive infection from SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, we found a pronounced reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection in pericytes pre-transduced with shDPP4 lentivirus (Figure 3I) (362 PFU/mL) vs. shScr lentivirus (820 PFU/mL) vs. naïve pericytes (736 PFU/mL).",
            "We then wanted to determine the dynamics at play in a transwell BBB model with HUVECs in the upper compartment and astrocytes and pericytes co-cultured in the lower compartment. We exposed the upper compartment to a 1 MOI SARS-CoV-2 infection for 48 h and measured the infection with qPCR, evaluated the paracellular permeability with 3 kDa and 10 kDa fluorescent dextran molecules, and lastly quantified the plaques from each compartment to determine the level of productive infection.",
            "We found that the infection significantly (p < 0.05) increased the detection of SARS-CoV-2 N and spike RNA 48 hpi in the transwell upper compartment (Figure 4A). In the lower well of the transwell, we detected N and spike transcripts, however, only the N expression was significantly increased (Figure 4B).",
            "After confirming a productive infection in the transwell BBB model, we wanted to determine if the direct infection of the upper well alters the paracellular permeability. TNF-α (10 ng/mL) was used as a positive control in this experiment. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper well did not alter the paracellular permeability of either dextran-sized molecule (3 kDa, 10 kDa) at either time measured despite our expectations (Figure 4C).",
            "Lastly, we examined plaque assays with the supernatant from the upper and lower compartments of the transwell BBB model (Figure 4D). We found a significant (p < 0.05) number of plaques derived from the upper compartment (470 PFU/mL) but an insignificant (p = 0.1093) number of plaques in the lower well (98.18 PFU/mL). While statistically insignificant, it did indicate that the virus passes through the HUVEC monolayer in the luminal well without the disruption of the paracellular tight junctions, suggesting that active transport may be responsible for virions in the abluminal side.",
            "To determine how viral particles move across the BBB without the disruption of paracellular permeability, we used inhibitors of the endocytosis and endosomal transport process (Table 3) in conjunction with an ACE2 lentiviral knockdown to isolate the effects that ACE2 and/or endocytosis play in SARS-CoV-2 transcytosis. We have selected (i) PNGase F that catalyzes the cleavage of N-linked oligosaccharides between the innermost GlcNAc and asparagine residues of high mannose, hybrid and complex oligosaccharides from N-linked glycoproteins, (ii) chlorpromazine (CPZ) that inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis, (iii) filipin that inhibits caveolin-mediated endocytosis, (iv) brefeldin A (BFA) that disrupts the trans-Golgi body, and (v) monensin that inhibits the function of the late endosome/lysosome by preventing acidification. Collectively, these drugs will allow us to determine the type of endocytosis, avenues of intracellular transport, and the roles organelles play in transcytosis.",
            "First, we incubated HUVECs in the upper compartment with shACE2- or shScr-lentivirus for 48 h, and then, prior to infection, we incubated cells with PNGase F at 1 U per 300 cells for 4 h, CPZ at 25 µM for 2 h, filipin 2 µg/mL for 2 h, BFA at 1 µg/mL for 2 h, or monensin at 5 µM for 2 h. Utilizing crystal violet, we verified monolayer health and attachment after exposure to their respective lentiviral conditions, pharmacologics, and infection (Figure S2). We exposed the transwell BBB model to 1 MOI SARS-CoV-2 for 16 h to observe any transcytosis phenomenon before the first full replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2, which is approximately 22 h [23,64,65,66]. As a verification that SARS-CoV-2 had not been fully replicated yet, we analyzed subgenomic RNA for N and spike which is a marker for actively replicating virus (Figure S3). We found that subgenomic N transcripts were detected, but subgenomic spike transcripts were not, indicating that a full replication cycle had not been completed yet. In the absence of any inhibitors, the transduction of shScr lentivirus (CoV-2 + Scramble) showed a significant increase in N and spike in the upper wells compared to mock; however, the exposure of shACE2 lentivirus (CoV-2 + shACE2) showed a significant reduction in both N and the spike transcripts compared to the shScr control (CoV-2 + scramble) (Figure 5A–D). The corresponding conditions measured using plaque assay from the lower wells showed the inverse effect—the transduction of shACE2 lentivirus significantly increased plaques in the lower well compared with its scramble counterpart (Figure 5I–K).",
            "Next, we examined the effects of inhibitors of endocytosis and endosomal transport in BBB transcytosis. Looking at infection in the upper well in the presence of PNGase F (Figure 5A–D), we found a significant reduction in N and spike transcripts in the shScr and shACE2 conditions. Additionally, PNGase F (Figure 5I,K) reduced the viral titer in the lower well in the shScr and shACE2 conditions compared to the corresponding vehicle conditions (Figure 5J,K).",
            "When analyzing the effects of CPZ in infection in the upper well, we found that in the presence of CPZ, the N transcript was not different from the vehicle-treated groups in the shScr and shACE2 conditions (Figure 5A,B). In contrast, we found a significant reduction in spike mRNA in shScr and shACE2 conditions (Figure 5C,D). Measuring the viral titer in the CPZ-treated group showed no difference in the shScr viral titers (Figure 5I,J), but a significant reduction in viral titer in the shACE2 condition (Figure 5I,K); the inclusion of CPZ disrupted the increased transcytosis seen in the vehicle + shACE2 condition.",
            "The addition of filipin to the transwell BBB model had similar effects to CPZ. We found a significant reduction in the N and spike transcripts in CoV-2 + shScr condition compared to the vehicle (Figure 5A,C). The fold change in N transcripts in the CoV-2 + shACE2 condition was no different than the vehicle condition (Figure 5B). However, we did find a reduction in spike transcripts in the CoV-2 + shACE2 group (Figure 5D). Looking at viral titers in the filipin-treated group, we found that there was no effect on viral titers in the CoV-2 + shScr group compared to vehicle condition (Figure 5I,J). However, we found a significant reduction in viral titer in CoV-2 + shACE2 group (Figure 5I,K).",
            "Next, in the upper well, we found that BFA-induced Golgi body disruption across all infection groups resulted in a significant reduction in N and spike transcripts compared to the vehicle control (Figure 5A–D). We also found that BFA disrupted tight junctions in 3kDa measurements of CoV-2 + shACE2 (Figure 5F), and in 10 kDa measurements in all four experimental groups assayed (Figure 5G,H). Interestingly, we also found significant reductions in viral titers in both CoV-2 + shScr and CoV-2 + shACE2 groups (Figure 5I–K), despite the disrupted paracellular permeability, suggesting a role of the trans-Golgi body on both infection in the upper well and transcytosis to the lower well.",
            "Lastly, the function of the lysosome in direct infection and transcytosis is not fully clear. In the presence of monensin, we found a diminished N and spike mRNA expression in the CoV-2 + shScr condition (Figure 5A,C), but that reduction was not seen in CoV-2 + shACE2 (Figure 5B,D). Looking at the titers in the presence of monensin, we found that there was no difference in CoV-2 + shScr compared with the vehicle (Figure 5I,J). However, we did find a significant reduction in the CoV-2 + shACE2 group compared to the vehicle group (Figure 5I,K). In most of the other drug + lentivirus conditions, we found the permeability coefficient stay at or around 1 × 10−6 cm/s (Figure 5E–H), indicating no paracellular tight junction disruption allowing us to make observations about direct infection and transcytosis in tandem, but in the presence of monensin we did see an increase in permeability which prevents us from making similar observations (Figure 5E–H).",
            "A summary of the detection of the nucleocapsid protein in the cells of the lower compartment (Figure 5L) showed the diminished detection of N protein in infected cells pre-exposed to PNGase F, CPZ, and filipin. Upon shACE2 lentiviral transduction, we found the effect of PNGase F was canceled out by ACE2 knockdown, but the CPZ and filipin effects were retained.",
            "In this study, we report several novel findings important to understanding how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the BBB and how the virus undergoes transcytosis to the abluminal side of the brain. First, we confirmed that infection is possible in endothelial cells (HUVEC) via the canonical infection process (ACE2-TMPRSS2), which was reported during the initial onset of the pandemic in January 2020 by Hoffman et al. [29]. Second, we determined that the most likely primary receptor for infection within astrocytes and pericytes is DPP4, which is also the receptor for MERS-CoV. Third, knocking down ACE2 in HUVECs, and DPP4 in astrocytes and pericytes diminishes but does not completely ablate infection. Fourth, transcytosis occurs regardless of ACE2 expression via glycocalyx anchoring and clathrin and/or caveolin-dependent manner.",
            "Here, we successfully depleted DPP4 and suggest a direct link of DPP4-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection of astrocytes and pericytes which agrees with other reports [67,68]. Also, we found that the transduction of shDPP4 lentivirus exhibited a reduction of furin expression (Figure S1). While some work has demonstrated furin’s role in priming, this effect seems to be variable and cell type dependent, and the knockdown or inhibition of furin may be overcome by other proteases in receptor-mediated infection processes [27,69]. However, since shDPP4 resulted in a partial knockdown, it will be prudent to include DPP4 competitive binding assays or direct DPP4 antibody interference in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 to elucidate a direct link more clearly. There also remains a debate about the role of DPP4 in receptor-mediated infection. It appears that DPP4 plays a small but noticeable role in BBB infection (and only in the absence of ACE2) since gliptin drugs have been demonstrated to directly interfere with the binding site exploited by the SARS-CoV-2 spike [67].",
            "There is still some controversy about how SARS-CoV-2 produces the neurological symptoms associated with acute and chronic forms of the disease. Our results affirm that these symptoms can be linked with a direct infection of the endothelium and the brain-side pericytes and astrocytes from the virus whereas other groups suggest that symptoms are downstream of an inflammatory response from the rest of the body [3,9,70]. While such inflammatory symptoms and direct infection are not mutually exclusive, our evidence suggests that acute and chronic brain disease states can be independent of the systemic inflammatory response and associated cytokine storm, particularly derived from the initial lung infection.",
            "The primary cells of the BBB used in our model are prone to de-differentiation after removal from their BBB niche [71,72,73,74,75]. This rapid de-differentiation following isolation plays a role in protein expression profiles. The results of our monolayer studies exhibit slightly different protein expression profiles than cells examined within the BBB niche. Also, we selected HUVECs instead of brain endothelial cells in our BBB experiments due to their ability to be induced by the BBB-like niche created when tri-cultured with astrocytes and pericytes [76,77,78,79,80].",
            "While transwell models represent an adequate model for BBB experimental designs, they are categorized as having lower biological relevance than in vivo [81] or custom-designed microfluidic BBB devices [74,82]. However, our BBB model did not include several physiological features, including the physical association of pericytes [83] with endothelial cells, and shear stress [84]. Further validation of our findings requires experiments in such more complex BBB models.",
            "In many cases of viral infection of the endothelium of the BBB, there is a corresponding tight junction disruption resulting in BBB paracellular “leakage” [85,86,87,88]. Several groups early in the pandemic using different dosages of spike protein found that there is a significant decrease in the measured tightness of tight junctions based on transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) as well as the expression of overall proteins involved in tight junction architecture (Claudin-5, ZO-1) [9,40,41,89]. However, other groups used a whole intact virus, they found that the paracellular tight junctions remained intact [23,90], which is consistent with our findings regarding paracellular permeability. Thus, tight junction disruption appears to be related to disease model type (spike vs. intact virions), cell type (primary vs. cell line), as well as SARS-CoV-2 variant dependence such as the WT, alpha, beta, delta, omicron isolates. This leads us to speculate that the c-terminus of the S1 peptide may be the subviral component responsible for tight junction disruption. While normally bound to S2 and hidden from interaction with cells [91], when dosed in isolation, it appears to have the largest effects on tight junction disruptions. Extending this logic, the shedding of S1 peptide during acute infection may also be an important factor in the disparate findings in laboratory results as well as BBB permeability status in clinical settings [92,93].",
            "Furthermore, the finding that ACE2 depletion increases transcytosis with a corresponding decrease in infection in the luminal side of the transwell suggests a likelihood of an inverse relationship between ACE2 expression and levels of transcytosis. However, this requires further validation. This finding places ACE2 expression on the luminal side of the BBB in a central role for understanding how acute and chronic infection of the brain parenchyma may occur. Additionally, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues seem to play a supporting role in multiple processes regarding SARS-CoV-2, including direct infection and transcytosis. As with many viruses, the glycocalyx and proteoglycan shell of cells typically provide a ‘sticky’ molecular environment for viruses to anchor to before interacting with their specific receptors. Several studies describe a key role of GlcNAc in transcytosis, likely playing an anchoring role via ionic interactions i.e., a negatively charged SARS-CoV-2 binds to the positively charged glycocalyx [80,81]. However, the understanding of how genetic manipulation or post-translational effects [94] play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and transcytosis remains mechanistically unclear. Future avenues of research should try to categorize the roles of the glycosylation of ACE2 and the general cellular glycosylation status to decipher how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the surface of the BBB. Since pharmacological inhibition is a less targeted method of controlling cellular functions due to off-target effects, our results suggest that the genetic disruption of processes may assist in further categorizing the types of transcytosis involved at the BBB.",
            "In addition, our findings suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 increases the transcellular routes of the blood-to-brain movement of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore may be partially responsible for brain infection. One study used a mouse model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and showed that Cav-1 plays a role in the increased unidirectional movement of macromolecules, and this increased transcellular phenotype was rescued with a Cav-1 knockout mouse [95]. This increased expression of Cav-1 was also discovered in our analysis of postmortem COVID-19 patients, further strengthening the role caveolin-mediated transcytosis could be playing in SARS-CoV-2 infection [96]. These findings are in agreement with other reports attempting to understand how SARS-CoV-2 moves across the BBB-injected mice with S1 protein, and described adsorptive transcytosis [10,97]—a process often mediated by caveolin—as the mechanism underlying the movement.",
            "Moreover, clathrin has been implicated to be important in both infection and transcytosis [98]. A study utilizing spike protein and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus demonstrated that clathrin is sufficient for internalization, although a caveolin-mediated avenue was not ruled out [61]. Importantly, clathrin and caveolin are both involved in many different types of internalization, transportation, and transcytosis processes within cells and delineating the location of each endosome requires further experimentation. Due to the accumulation of evidence for both caveolin and clathrin in these processes, it warrants much more study into how the components of SARS-CoV-2 (spike, nucleocapsid, envelope, and their variants) may be deterministic in cell localization and/or transcytosis.",
            "Overall, in our model, luminal BBB expression of ACE2 appears to operate as a molecular sponge, which can sequester a circulating virus and increase the proportion of luminal infection to and luminal viral secretion, which can then ultimately be managed and neutralized by the systemic immune response and counterintuitively play a role in protecting from SARS-CoV-2 transcytosis into the brain. The protective effect of ACE2 expression and overexpression is well documented in the Coronaviridae family of viruses [77], as well as the corresponding depletion leading to worse outcomes in both peripheral and CNS tissues in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection [12,78].",
            "Summarizing our results, SARS-CoV-2 progresses through a decision tree when interacting with the BBB. First, if ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are present at the luminal surface of the BBB, it can result in a direct infection of the endothelium. If ACE2 is present without TMPRSS2, then the BBB internalizes the virion, anchored by ACE2 binding, and produces a direct infection through the secondary targets of the endosome—likely the Golgi body. Lastly, if ACE2 is not present, but the virion becomes anchored through a separate molecular interaction, likely the glycocalyx, the probability of transcytosis increases and is mediated through either clathrin or caveolin. In sum, we propose a model for BBB-SARS-CoV-2 interactions including the direct infection of the cellular components of the BBB (Figure 6A,B,D,E), the transcytosis of SARS-CoV-2 through the BBB via glycocalyx anchoring and clathrin and/or caveolin endosomes (Figure 6C), and a lack of paracellular permeability increase (Figure 6F).",
            "Thus, the BBB is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple ways. The direct infection of endothelium, astrocytes, and pericytes, the three discrete cell types that comprise the BBB, is possible through ACE2 and DPP4, respectively. The direct infection of the endothelium does not appear to modulate the paracellular permeability of the BBB. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can undergo transcytosis even with a diminished expression of ACE2 on the luminal surface of the endothelium, leading to a deposition of virus in the brain parenchyma via caveolin and clathrin-mediated endocytosis.",

            "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an issue of global significance that has taken the lives of many across the world. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for its pathogenesis. The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been well described in the literature. Initially, it was thought to be limited to the respiratory system; however, we now recognize that COVID-19 also affects several other organs, including the nervous system. Two similar human coronaviruses (CoV) that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) are also known to cause disease in the nervous system. The neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are growing rapidly, as evidenced by several reports. There are several mechanisms responsible for such manifestations in the nervous system. For instance, post-infectious immune-mediated processes, direct virus infection of the central nervous system (CNS), and virus-induced hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states are commonly involved. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and its variants, dysfunction of taste and smell, and muscle injury are numerous examples of COVID-19 PNS (peripheral nervous system) disease. Likewise, hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, encephalitis, meningitis, encephalopathy acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, endothelialitis, and venous sinus thrombosis are some instances of COVID-19 CNS disease. Due to multifactorial and complicated pathogenic mechanisms, COVID-19 poses a large-scale threat to the whole nervous system. A complete understanding of SARS-CoV-2 neurological impairments is still lacking, but our knowledge base is rapidly expanding. Therefore, we anticipate that this comprehensive review will provide valuable insights and facilitate the work of neuroscientists in unfolding different neurological dimensions of COVID-19 and other CoV associated abnormalities.",
            "Since December 2019, the health effects of a novel coronavirus (CoV) disease have been witnessed in a worldwide outbreak of severe pneumonia caused by a deadly infectious virus originating in Wuhan, China. From the first human CoV-positive cases detected in Wuhan (WHO 2020), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly in humans around the globe. SARS-CoV-2, a strain of CoV, causes the clinical syndrome COVID-19, whose pulmonary manifestations have been well recorded. The increasing number of positive cases has reached more than 54.7 million, with 1,323,230 deaths reported as of November 15, 2020 (Worldometer 2020). A very interesting fact about this virus is that a higher lethality of infection has been recognized in those over the age of 65 and patients with comorbidities (Baud et al. 2020; Guan et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020a, b, c, d).",
            "There is increasing evidence of neurological complications detected in patients due to SARS-CoV-2, and this raises the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is neurotropic and whether it contributes to post-infectious neurological complications. Two similar human CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), have also been reported to be associated with neurological disease in uncommon cases. A handful of case reports have described neurological complications in patients with COVID-19 (Huang et al. 2020; Netland et al. 2008; Zhang 2020; Kim et al. 2017). However, owing to a lack of understanding of the specific mechanisms, it remains unclear to what extent SARS-CoV-2 itself affects or damages the nervous system, and what neurological symptoms are attributable to secondary mechanisms. Viral neuroinvasion may be achieved by several routes, including entry via the olfactory nerve, transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, leukocyte migration across the blood–brain barrier (BBB), or infection of the vascular endothelium. SARS-CoV-2 mainly affects the lower respiratory tract, and the most common and frequent neurological complaints in COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, and headache, along with others including fever, fatigue, myalgia, dry cough, and diarrhea (Gutiérrez-Ortiz et al. 2020). Additionally, coma, seizure, stroke, encephalopathy, and impaired consciousness have also been observed (Gutiérrez-Ortiz et al. 2020). The identification and understanding of the array of COVID-19-associated neurological diseases may lead to improved clinical outcomes and better treatment algorithms. This comprehensive review serves to recapitulate available data related to CoV in the nervous system, identify the potential tissue targets and entry routes of SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS, and address the array of clinical neurological manifestations and complications that have been recorded so far in COVID-19 and their potential pathomechanisms. Further neuropathological studies will be significant in order to understand the disease pathogenesis and the interconnection between SARS-CoV-2 and the CNS. Most importantly, longitudinal neurological and cognitive assessment of individuals after recovery from COVID-19 will be crucial for understanding the natural history of COVID-19 in the CNS and monitoring for any long-term neurological sequelae.",
            "Recent evidence suggests that the nervous system might also be involved in the COVID-19 pathophysiology. As revealed by a retrospective study of 200 patients in China, neurological symptoms were experienced by a subset of patients affected by COVID-19 (Mao et al. 2020). The neurological symptoms that were experienced include impaired consciousness, skeletal muscle symptoms, and acute cerebrovascular disease, all of which indicated the involvement of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). Patients suffering from severe COVID-19 were more likely to exhibit these symptoms. Hyposmia and hypogeusia were other possible PNS symptoms that were observed. As patients were hospitalized at the time of publication, it was not possible to investigate the link between patient outcome and neurological symptoms. In another study conducted on the same group of patients, it was revealed that COVID-19 infection in 13 patients was followed by acute cerebrovascular diseases, including cerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (Li et al. 2020a, b).These features were observed more commonly in older patients and patients with severe disease. A second study conducted in France reported similar neurological manifestations as were revealed in a Chinese study, where 58 patients with COVID-19 experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome and had to be admitted to a hospital (Helms et al. 2020). Neurological symptoms were observed in 85% of the patients at various points in time, with consequences ranging from the discontinuation of neuromuscular blockade to admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Neurological features included corticospinal tract dysfunction, encephalopathy, delirium, and agitation. Bilateral frontotemporal hypoperfusion and leptomeningeal enhancement were also revealed in a small subset of patients on conducting perfusion brain imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Evidence of small acute ischemic stroke was also present in two patients. While further studies are needed to characterize the associated neurological manifestations, the number of COVID-19 cases with a reported acute neurological disorder is increasing, ranging from acute myelitis and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) to hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy (Karimi et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2020a, 2020b; Poyiadji 2020; Moriguchi 2020; Sedaghat and Karimi 2020; Toscano et al. 2020). Compared to past instances of coronavirus epidemics, significantly fewer neurological associations have been established, but several case reports of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have described patients developing rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, and seizures (Lau et al. 2004; Tsai et al. 2005; Hung et al. 2003; Chao et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2005). In a study that involved 206 SARS patients, acute cerebrovascular disease was reported in five cases (Umapathi 2004). However, it is debatable whether this indicates a direct comparison between SARS pathophysiology and COVID-19. Acknowledging that in some cases these are associated with different diagnoses, and noting that they are rare presentations, the presence of RNA in both autopsied brain tissue (Xu et al. 2005) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Lau et al. 2004; Tsai et al. 2005; Hung et al. 2003) suggests a neurotropic component of the SARS coronavirus. Furthermore, several case reports of patients during the MERS-CoV outbreak noted neurological disorders, including delirium, neuropathy, and acute cerebrovascular disease (Kim et al. 2017; Algahtani et al. 2016; Arabi et al. 2015). Seizures in six participants and confusion in 18 patients were reported during another study that involved 70 MERS patients (Saad et al. 2014), although caution is warranted in the interpretation of such findings. There is little evidence that indicates the presence of MERS coronavirus in CSF as compared to SARS. It seems to be the same case with COVID-19; where evidence of the presence of the virus in the CSF is restricted to a single report (Moriguchi 2020) whose findings have not been replicated by other studies (Helms et al. 2020; Karimi et al. 2020; Toscano et al. 2020). Over a million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, and while definitive evidence is sparse, emerging publications and preprints justify careful consideration of the neurological associations with COVID-19 infection (Fig.1).Fig. 1Schematic representation showing the possible mechanisms underlying neurological consequences of COVID-19.

            "An important line of research pertains to the question of whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is neuroinvasive. Much published evidence is available on this issue. Similar to SARS-CoV, the molecular mechanisms underlying cell invasion by SARS-CoV-2 are related to the capacity of the virus to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. The CNS is a potential target for SARS-CoV-2, because the ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the neurons and glial cells in the CNS and epithelial cells of the digestive and respiratory systems (Xu et al. 2020a; Zhang et al. 2020; Lukassen et al. 2020; Wong et al. 2020; Baig et al. 2020). Emerging data suggest that ACE2 receptors are expressed in multiple regions of the human and mouse brain, including the posterior cingulate cortex, motor cortex, substantia nigra, ventricles, olfactory bulb, middle temporal gyrus, nucleus of tractus solitarius, ventrolateral medulla, and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, and on several key cell types that make up the CNS including neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes (Fig. 2) (Chen et al. 2020a; Xia and Lazartigues 2008; Doobay et al. 2007). Moreover, neuronal death in mice has been exhibited with SARS-CoV as it invades the CNS through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and, subsequently, the olfactory neuroepithelium (Netland et al. 2008). The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS is also possible through the hematogenous route. With the presence of the virus in the general circulation and the slow blood flow, the ACE2 receptors expressed in the capillary endothelium may interact with SARS-CoV-2 (Zhang et al. 2020). Endothelial damage and cerebral bleeding observed in patients suffering from COVID-19 may also be due to this mechanism. Moreover, preliminary evidence suggests that there might be prognostic implications in the acute phase for the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2. It has been hypothesized that any death that is entirely due to severe respiratory involvement is mediated by central hypoventilation syndrome secondary to CNS invasion (Li et al. 2020a, b). When a review of the Wuhan reports involving 214 COVID-19 patients was conducted, neurological symptoms were observed in more than 36% of individuals. Patients who exhibited neurological manifestations suffered from severe COVID-19. In addition, the neurological symptoms that were reported most frequently were acute stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic), skeletal muscle damage, and impaired consciousness (Mao et al. 2020). Evidence of CNS invasion has subsequently been displayed in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2. Researchers at the Beijing Ditan Hospital used genome sequencing to identify SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF of a patient affected with clinical encephalitis and COVID-19, but it has still not been determined whether SARS-CoV-2 remains in the CNS over the medium or long term (Mao et al. 2020). However, viral latency in the CNS has been described for other viruses as well, including some coronaviruses. For example, in the CNS, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) was detected after more an year post-inoculation in a murine model of coronavirus encephalitis (Xiang et al. 2019; Jacomy et al. 2006). How the virus can persist in the CNS is a question that has been the subject of debate. There have been suggestions that inflammatory and cytolytic strategies that have shown potential in the control of viral infection cannot be used in the brain by the immune system, as they can have potentially devastating consequences. Thus, another type of immune response is initiated in the CNS, which favors viral latency in the CNS as well as reactivation in situations that are entirely favorable (Miller et al. 2016). The possibility that SARS-COV-2 might remain suppressed in the CNS cannot be ruled out entirely. If it does, delayed onset of neurological symptoms might be observed as a result of viral reactivation in the medium or long term. This might eventually result in the reactivation of a series of processes that are neuroinflammatory in nature and are linked to neurodegenerative diseases.Fig. 2a Human cells that express ACE2 receptors in the CNS. b Brain areas that express ACE2 receptors. c Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to a neuron (ACE2 receptors on a medullary neuron binding to the SPIKE protein on SARS-CoV-2)",

            "There may be an indirect effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS, more specifically on the progression of disorders that are neurodegenerative in nature. In the past few years there have been descriptions of a strong correlation between neuroinflammation, microbiota, and CNS diseases. SARS-CoV-2 is also known to trigger inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis, infecting the mucosa cells, which potentially results in short-term and long-term alterations in the gut microbiota. This usually leads to the development of neurodegenerative diseases and neurodegeneration (Lin et al. 2018).",
            "There have been suggestions that direct invasion of the nervous system by viruses is possible, which often lead to nerve damage. This is based on the detection of proteins and genetic materials of different viruses in tissue samples of the nervous system, including the CSF/brain (Koyuncu et al. 2013; Leber et al. 2016).",
            "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a classic virus that uses the circulation of the blood to enter the CNS. It then undergoes multiplication in the vascular cells of the skin area, impacted by the mosquito bite. Subsequently, for reproduction in the mononuclear macrophages throughout the body, the virus is released into the blood. Through the cytokines produced, the secondary release into the bloodstream increases the BBB permeability. This promotes the virus’s entry into the brain, thereby leading to viral encephalitis (Unni et al. 2011). Additional studies are expected to determine whether the CoV, particularly SARS-CoV-2, can use the blood circulation pathway to invade the nervous system, as present evidence is extremely rare (Koyuncu et al. 2013; Desforges et al. 2019).",
            "The neuronal pathway is an important vehicle facilitating the entry of neurotropic viruses into the CNS. Migration of the viruses is possible through infection of motor or sensory nerve endings, achieving retrograde or anterograde neuronal transport through the motor proteins, dynein, and kinesins (Swanson and McGavern 2015). Olfactory neuron transport is an example of a neuronal pathway. The olfactory bulb in the forebrain and the nasal cavity and olfactory nerves have a distinct anatomical structure, which makes it an efficient channel between the CNS and nasal epithelium (Koyuncu et al. 2013). Consequently, during the initial stages of infection or nasal vaccination, CoV can use the olfactory tract to enter the brain (Desforges et al. 2019; Mori 2015). For instance, once CoV infects the nasal cells, it can use the olfactory bulb and olfactory nerves to reach the CSF and the entire brain within one week, leading to demyelinating reaction and inflammation. However, the invasion of CoV into the CNS was restricted after removal of the olfactory bulb in mice (Bohmwald et al. 2018). SARS virus particles as well as genome sequences in brain neurons were also detected by Gu et al. (Gu et al. 2005). This observation suggests that CNS can be invaded by CoV through the periphery via neural pathways.",
            "Formation of transparent membranes, edema, and diffusion of alveolar and interstitial inflammatory exudation is caused by a virus when it proliferates in the lung tissue cells. This results in increased anaerobic metabolism in the mitochondria of brain cells and causes hypoxia through alveolar gas exchange disorders in the CNS (Abdennour et al. 2012). Various disorders can be caused by the accumulation of the acid, including obstruction of cerebral blood flow, cerebral vasodilation, interstitial edema, swelling of brain cells, and even headache due to ischemia and congestion (Abdennour et al. 2012). Cerebral circulation disorder and cerebral edema can also quickly worsen if the hypoxia continues unabated. Brain function gradually deteriorates with intracranial hypertension and may lead to bulbar conjunctival edema, drowsiness, and coma, (Abdennour et al. 2012). Moreover, acute cerebrovascular diseases such as acute ischemic stroke may be induced by hypoxia in patients who are at a higher risk of developing cerebrovascular disease. Hypoxia injury may lead to further damage to the nervous system, because severe hypoxia is commonly found in patients affected by COVID-19 (Guo et al. 2020).",
            "The immune system might mediate the viral infection that causes damage to the nervous system (Klein et al. 2017). The development of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is closely related to the pathology of severe viral infections. In cases of pneumonia triggered by CoV infection, abnormal initiation of SIRS is possible. The risk of injury to the nervous system and immune damage can be prevented by timely anti-inflammatory intervention (Mehta et al. 2020; Fu et al. 2020). In addition, a significantly higher number of casualties have been caused by COVID-19 and SARS predominantly due to multi-organ failure (MOF), which is a result of virus-induced SIRS or SIRS-like immune disorders (Yin et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2020b). The ability of CoV infections to persist and infect microglia, macrophages, and astrocytes in the CNS is crucial. A pro-inflammatory state can also be induced by glial cell activation via a neurotropic virus (Li et al. 2004). There is a positive correlation between interleukin (IL-6), which is an important member of the cytokine storm, and the symptoms of COVID-19 (Wan et al. 2020). Experiments have confirmed that a large number of inflammatory factors, including IL-12, IL-15, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), are secreted by primary glial cells once they have been infected with CoV (Bohmwald et al. 2018). Chronic inflammation and brain damage are also caused by the activation of immune cells in the brain.",
            "As a cardio-cerebral vascular protection factor, ACE2 exists in various organs, including the skeletal muscles and the nervous system. It plays an essential role in anti-atherosclerosis mechanisms and regulation of blood pressure (Miller and Arnold 2019). Moreover, ACE2 is an extremely important target for various influenza viruses and CoV (Turner et al. 2004; Wrapp et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2014). The increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage and abnormally elevated blood pressure may be caused by these viruses by binding to the ACE2 receptors. Moreover, the virus has the potential to damage the BBB and enter the CNS by attacking the vascular system, as the ACE2 expressed in the capillary endothelium can interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Baig et al. 2020).",
            "Neurological damage can be caused by CoV infections, as the biological properties of the CNS may facilitate their exacerbation. The invasion of the virus is inhibited by the lack of permeability of the blood vessels due to the dense parenchymal structure of the CNS. However, if any virus has access to the CNS, it is not easily removed (Reinhold and Rittner 2017). The eradication of viruses in nerve cells depends mainly on the role of cytotoxic T cells because of the lack of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens in nerve cells, although a relatively protective effect is provided by apoptosis of mature neurons after virus infection (Wuthrich et al. 2015). Moreover, the continued existence of the virus also contributes to the homeostasis characteristics of the cells in the CNS (Reinhold and Rittner 2017). The possible mechanisms of nervous system injury caused by CoV are depicted in (Fig.3).Fig. 3Schematic representation showing pathomechanisms of nervous system injury caused by coronaviruses (CoV).

            "At present, it is unclear how the human CNS is invaded by SARS-CoV-2. Few researchers have postulated plausible mechanisms of neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 through transsynaptic or BBB spread (Fig. 4) (Dube et al. 2018).Fig. 4Transsynaptic viral spread: (a) Spread via the transcribrial route: Coronavirus (CoV) has been shown to spread via the transcribrial route from the olfactory epithelium along the olfactory nerve to the olfactory bulb within the CNS. (b) Spread via transsynaptic transfer: CoV has been shown to spread retrograde via transsynaptic transfer using an endocytosis or exocytosis mechanism and a fast axonal transport (FAT) mechanism of vesicle transport to move virus along microtubules back to neuronal cell bodies. Mechanisms of spread across the BBB: (c) Leukocyte infection: Infected leukocytes can cross the BBB to infect the CNS through the Trojan horse mechanism. (d) Endothelial infection: Infected vascular endothelial cells have been shown to spread SARS-CoV-2 to glial cells in the CNS",
            "Transsynaptic viral spread: (a) Spread via the transcribrial route: Coronavirus (CoV) has been shown to spread via the transcribrial route from the olfactory epithelium along the olfactory nerve to the olfactory bulb within the CNS.

Mechanisms of spread across the BBB: (c) Leukocyte infection: Infected leukocytes can cross the BBB to infect the CNS through the Trojan horse mechanism. (d) Endothelial infection: Infected vascular endothelial cells have been shown to spread SARS-CoV-2 to glial cells in the CNS",
            "In the literature, the path of transsynaptic spread has been described for HCoV-OC43, hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus-67 (HEV67), and avian bronchitis virus (Dube et al. 2018). For inter- and intra-neuronal spread of neurotrophic virus, axonal microtubules facilitate molecular movement across axons either in antegrade or retrograde fashion (Desforges et al. 2019; Berth et al. 2009). A few reports have noted an isolated loss of smell (anosmia) and loss of taste (ageusia) with or without the invasion of respiratory system (Giacomelli et al. 2020). Researchers noted that the direct entry of SARS-CoV-2 along the olfactory nerve is a potential route for the virus to gain entry into the CNS (Matsuda et al. 2004). Few reports have proved a transcribrial route of spread in preclinical studies for SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-OCR43 models through the intranasal route (McCray et al. 2007). Brann et al. and Fodulian et al. suggested the presence of ACE-2 receptors in sustentacular stem cells in the olfactory epithelium (Fodoulian et al. 2020; Brann et al. 2020). However, there is a scarcity of reports of olfactory neuropathy that is SARS-related (Hwang 2006). The most important COVID-19 infection features, which are being increasingly recognized as hyposmia and anosmia, are now the more common presenting symptoms (Mao et al. 2020; Lechien et al. 2020; Menni et al. 2020; Wolfel et al. 2020; Giacomelli et al. 2020; Bagheri et al. 2020). According to animal studies, it has been suggested that SARS-CoV can reach the brain and promote neurodegeneration through the olfactory route (Netland et al. 2008). These clinical reports help researchers trace the path of olfactory epithelial damage underlying clinical anosmia (Brann et al. 2020; Fodoulian et al. 2020).",
            "Hematogenous dissemination is one of the suggested mechanisms, wherein the endothelial cells or leukocytes are infected by the virus that traverses from the bloodstream into the CNS (Desforges et al. 2019). The neural spread of SARS-CoV-2 via the BBB is through the spread of infection across vascular endothelial cells due to the presence of ACE2 receptors in the endothelial cells (Paniz-Mondolfi et al. 2020). Once a neurotrophic virus gains entry along vascular endothelial cells, the virus is integrated with cells containing ACE2 receptors (neurons, glia and vascular channels) and is able to exert its effects (Baig et al. 2020). Another possible pathway that has been suggested is the passage of infected leucocytes through the BBB (Desforges et al. 2014). This mechanism of neurotropism has been demonstrated in the case of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and SARS-CoV-1(Kim et al. 2003; Spiegel et al. 2006; Nicholls et al. 2006; Trojanowicz et al. 2017). In SARS-CoV-2 infection, T cells facilitate viral infection but not replication (Wang et al. 2020a). Due to the widespread systemic effects of COVID-19, BBB permeability is increased, and hence CNS entry is gained through the passage of infected immune cells (Sankowski et al. 2015). These studies aiming to improve an understanding of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism provide promising avenues for future research.",
            "The human coronavirus (HCV) has been used in several experimental models for the identification of the environmental component that triggers changes in the autoimmune system in multiple sclerosis (MS) cases (Sun 1995; Houtman et al. 1995; Wege 1995; Arbour 1999). An important role in MS pathophysiology is played by the toll-like receptors (TLRs) that are involved in the recognition of pathogens and host defense. Some researchers have postulated that these receptors recognize the viral particles and contribute to the modification of the immune response of patients developing MS. This interaction also suggests a probable link between viral infections (including CoV) and the development of demyelinating disease (Duffy and O’Reilly 2016). A large panel comprising samples of human brain autopsy was subjected to an observational study. This was done for targeted detection of HCV RNA. In addition, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for OC43 and 229E CoV strains was performed on the samples collected from 39 patients affected by MS and 51 patients suffering from several varying neurological conditions or normal controls. A significantly higher prevalence of OC43 was reported in the results for individuals with MS as compared to the controls [35.9% (14 of 39) vs 13.7% (7 of 51)] (Arbour 2000). Another observational study showed that 4 out of 21 specimens from a white matter plaque, normal-appearing white matter, gray matter, and cervical cord tissue of MS patients tested for HCV-229E nucleic acid consistently gave positive results, while none of the 11 control brain specimens did so. A similar study reported the detection of murine-like CoV in 12 of 22 MS brains. Another study also reported that murine-like CoV was detected in 12 out of 22 MS brain specimens (Murray 1992). In addition to the isolation of HCV from the brains of patients suffering from MS, this association is supported by the observation of particles that appeared to be similar to the CoV in perivascular cuffing of an MS plaque intrathecal synthesis of antibodies to HCV-OC43 and HCV-229E in a significant number of patients suffering from MS (Stewart et al. 1992). Persistence of the infection in a leukocyte cell line and direct inoculation of the endothelial cells that act as a BBB enables CoV to infect dendritic cells and macrophages. It also enables CoV to effect changes in the whole innate immune system (Gerna 2007). In a separate study, experimental modeling was performed on susceptible strains of mice that were inoculated with the CoV JHMV strain. The results showed the development of an acute encephalomyelitis followed by a chronic demyelinating disease (Libbey et al. 2014). Multiple models of murine CoV have been used to induce demyelinating diseases in rodents (Houtman et al. 1995), either through a consistent infection of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes or through autoimmune simulation against the myelin basic protein. The reason for this is the contribution to the postulated molecular mimicry depicted by it (Boucher 2007). However, irrespective of all these findings that have expressed some association between the alpha and beta CoV along with the demyelinating disease, no connection can be demonstrated between MS and SARS-CoV-2, though a subsequent association cannot be ruled out.",
            "Several experimental studies that inoculated CoV in mice showed a loss of myelin in the mouse spinal cords during the acute phase of the acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (Wu and Perlman 1999), and subsequent destruction of myelin after around 2–3 weeks of infection (Savarin 2008; Fehr and Perlman 2015). There was another case where a 15-year-old patient exhibited signs of initial upper respiratory symptoms along with subsequent ADEM. In this case, the nasopharyngeal specimens and the CSF showed positive results for HCV-OC43 (Yeh 2004). Another report pertaining to the case of a 71-year-old patient who tested positive for MERS-CoV noted that on the 24th day of the disease, new lesions were discovered in the patient’s bilateral pons, corpus callosum, periventricular deep white matter, upper cervical cord, left cerebellum, and midbrain (Algahtani et al. 2016). Further clinical research is needed to support the relationship between CoV and ADEM, even though the evidence indicates the persistence of the CoV RNA in the nervous system after the infection’s acute phase has occurred and has already caused neuronal loss.",
            "Encephalitis leads to inflammatory lesions in the brain parenchyma that are caused by pathogens and include nerve tissue lesions and neuronal damage. This condition is characterized by its acute onset, and common symptoms include vomiting, high fever, convulsions, headache, and consciousness disorders (Ellul and Solomon 2018). Early diagnosis of the condition is critical for patient survival. A treatment team from the Beijing Ditan Hospital reported that during the ongoing pneumonia epidemic, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in the CSF of COVID-19 patients through genome sequencing. This presented clinical verification of the presence of viral encephalitis (Xiang et al. 2020) and offered clear indications for encephalitis caused by CoV.",
            "Infectious toxic encephalitis, also known as acute toxic encephalopathy, is related to a specific type of reversible brain dysfunction syndrome, which is a result of several factors including metabolism disorders, toxemia, and hypoxia experienced during the process of acute infection (Mizuguchi et al. 2007; Tauber et al. 2017; Young 2013). Cerebral edema is one of the basic pathological changes witnessed during this condition, although CSF analysis indicates no evidence of inflammation. The clinical symptoms of the condition are diverse and complex. Patients suffering from a mild course of the disease can develop mental disorders, headache, delirium, and dysphoria, whereas patients who are seriously affected can experience loss of consciousness, disorientation, paralysis, and coma (Dobbs 2011; Mizuguchi et al. 2007). Another significant cause of this condition is an acute viral infection, which has been exemplified by a respiratory infection caused by CoV. Severe viremia and hypoxia are often observed in patients suffering from COVID-19 (Guo et al. 2020), as they have the potential to lead to toxic encephalopathy. Additionally, almost 40% of patients with COVID-19 develop symptoms such as disturbed consciousness, headache, and other symptoms of brain dysfunction (Mao et al. 2020). Another autopsy study revealed that edema was detected in the brain tissues of COVID-19 patients (Xu et al. 2020b). Although detailed studies are urgently needed, these findings collectively indicate that infectious toxic encephalopathy can be caused by COVID-19.",
            "In one study, HCV-OC43 testing was used to investigate the notion that an infectious respiratory pathogen could infiltrate the CNS, ultimately leading to swelling and neuroinflammation. The study reported that the infection caused neuronal degeneration, which eventually led to neuronal apoptosis. After the inoculation of HCV-OC43 in susceptible mice samples, the mice developed acute encephalitis, with viral RNA present for several months in surviving animals leading to neural degeneration (Jacomy et al. 2006). Full-length HCV-OC43 RNA was recovered from the brain of an 11-month-old boy who exhibited symptoms of viral encephalitis and severe combined immunodeficiency after cord blood transplantation. The patient was unable to survive and died 1.5 months after transplantation. Two months after the onset of symptoms, RNA sequencing of a brain biopsy sample was obtained, and it exhibited the presence of HCV-OC43. This diagnosis was further confirmed by brain immunohistochemical analysis and real-time PCR (Morfopoulou 2016). After a 3-day history of fever, cough, and altered psychological status, necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalitis was found in a middle-aged woman affected by COVID-19. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) images of the head showcased symmetric hypoattenuation within the bilateral medial thalami. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) further demonstrated hemorrhagic lesions within the medial temporal lobes, bilateral thalami, and sub-insular regions (Poyiadji 2020). In yet another case, after experiencing fever, headache, and fatigue, a 24-year-old man presented with altered mental status and seizures, which further led to impaired consciousness. Laboratory and clinical evidence indicated viral meningoencephalitis, and detection of SARS-CoV-2 was determined in the RT-PCR analysis of the CSF. A brain MRI was conducted and showed alterations in the right wall of the lateral ventricle, the right mesial temporal lobe, and the hippocampus, indicating SARS-CoV-2 meningitis. Surprisingly, the results for SARS-CoV-2 were negative in the RT-PCR of the nasopharyngeal swab specimen, raising the possibility of COVID-19 independent mechanisms of neuropathogenesis (Moriguchi 2020). Conclusive evidence for establishing the relationship between COVID-19 and encephalitis is still needed, despite the postulated mechanisms of clinical reports and neuronal colonization.",
            "Substantial available evidence points specifically to respiratory-related infection as an independent risk factor for acute cerebrovascular disease (Elkind 2007; Warren-Gash et al. 2018). Data derived from an experimental mouse model indicate that ischemic brain injury can be aggravated by the influenza virus, which triggers a cytokine cascade and significantly enhances the risk of cerebral hemorrhage post-treatment with a tissue-type plasminogen activator (Muhammad et al. 2011). It has been widely reported that SARS-CoV-2 can cause cytokine storm syndromes, which might be one factor indicating that acute cerebrobasilar disease can be caused by CoV (Mehta et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2020d). A severe reduction in the platelet count and an increase in D-dimer levels are exhibited by critically ill patients severely affected by SARS-CoV-2. This can render patients vulnerable to different acute cerebrovascular events (Wang et al. 2020b). Hence, there is a significant likelihood that patients with a risk of developing cerebrovascular disease during CoV infections must be alert to the occurrence of acute cerebrovascular events.",
            "One of the lesser-known complications of viral CNS infections is stroke. In Singapore, out of 206 SARS-CoV patients, five patients were reported to have large vessel stroke. Out of the four patients who were reported to be critically ill, three eventually died. In two patients, significant hypotension occurred just prior to the onset of stroke, along with disseminated intravascular coagulation and cardiac dysfunction (Umapathi 2004). An observational report pertaining to patients who were critically infected with SARS-CoV found an increased incidence of venous thromboembolism among patients (Lew 2003). A case series in Wuhan reported the occurrence of 14 strokes among a total of 214 patients affected by COVID-19. The data revealed that patients who exhibited cardiovascular risk factors and severe systemic presentation were extremely likely to be affected by acute cerebrovascular disease (Mao et al. 2020). In another retrospective study, stroke occurred in elderly patients who were affected with COVID-19 and exhibited multiple cardiovascular risk factors. In all cases, the mechanism of vascular damage was documented as large vessel disease (Avula 2020). More recently, five cases of stroke were reported in the context of COVID-19. Various vascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were present in three of the younger patients. In all of these cases, evidence of large vessel occlusion was documented, and these vessels were treated with endovascular therapy. However, this association between stroke and COVID-19 is likely due to the similar risk factors shared by the two conditions. Adequate evidence is available that indicates the seriousness of COVID-19 infection in humans pertaining to the presence of different cardiovascular comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension and large vessel disease in the elderly (Guo 2020). A recent meta-analysis comprising eight studies from China covering 46,248 infected patients indicated that the highly prevalent comorbidities were diabetes (8%) and hypertension (17%), followed by heart conditions (cardiovascular diseases) (5%) (Yang 2020; Zhou 2020). In several cases where patients exhibited no substantial vascular risk factors, the highly significant cerebrovascular disease mechanism was the hypercoagulability induced by SARS-CoV-2 (Avula 2020; Panigada 2020). When it comes to COVID-19 infection, there is an increased risk of stroke in those patients who have exhibited an earlier history of different vascular risk factors (Guo 2020; Yang 2020; Zhou 2020). Additionally, there is a chance that such patients will face severe complications such as hypotension, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, shock heart failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. This could most certainly lead to large vessel occlusion, embolic mechanisms of stroke, and hypoperfusion (Wang et al. 2020c; Chen 2020d; Avula 2020; Zhou 2020; Oxley et al. 2020). In a detailed observational study that comprised 138 patients affected by COVID-19, 7.2% of the patients showed indications of the presence of acute cardiac injury, 8.7% of infected patients exhibited shock, and 16.7% showed symptoms of arrhythmia (Wang et al. 2020d). Another observational study conducted on 191 patients in China showed that 20% of the patients had septic shock complication, 17% had acute cardiac injury, 23% had heart failure, and 19% had coagulopathy (Zhou 2020). All these risk factors potentially predispose patients to stroke (Powers 2019). Further research is required to clarify the presence of specific viral factors that directly cause arteritis, hypercoagulability, and endothelial dysfunction that might eventually lead to brain bleeding or ischemic stroke (Powers 2019).",
            "Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an uncommon neurological condition in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks part of the PNS (the network of nerves located outside of the brain and spinal cord). GBS is also known as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), which can develop after a respiratory/gastrointestinal infection (Nguyen and Taylor 2020). It is supposed that a molecular mimicry mechanism of viruses, in which infecting viruses likely share epitopes similar to components of peripheral nerves (which activate autoreactive B or T cells), is accountable for its occurrence. The immune system produces antibodies, which are responsible to fight the virus cross-react and bind to components of the PNS, causing neuronal dysfunction. After SARS-CoV-1 infections both AIDP and acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) variants have been reported (Tsai et al. 2005). Cases of Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, AMAN, and AIDP have been reported in the setting of MERS-CoV (Kim et al. 2017). However, reports of GBS in patients with COVID-19 are emerging. In Italy, a case series reported five cases of GBS after COVID-19 infection (Toscano et al. 2020). In four cases, patients developed lower-extremity weakness and presented paresthesias. Patients developed symptoms a mean of 5–10 days after onset of viral symptoms. Electromyography studies showed that three patients had AMAN and two had AIDP. Additional case reports describe a patient from Italy with Miller-Fisher-variant GBS and a patient in Iran with AMAN (Gutierrez-Ortiz et al. 2020; Sedaghat and Karimi 2020). A clinical case of acute transverse myelitis was also reported from Wuhan, but related CSF and MRI findings were not available. The patient presented flaccid lower-extremity paralysis with loss of pinprick sensation and paresthesias below the T10 level, and was effectively treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids (Zhao et al. 2020a, b, c).",
            "Loss of taste (dysgeusia/ageusia) and perturbation of smell (hyposmia/anosmia) have been reported as one of the striking manifestations of symptoms in patients with COVID-19. However, there are several uncertainties involved, including the specificity of the symptoms and the frequency of the symptoms as a probable diagnostic clue for COVID-19 in comparison to other symptomatically similar ailments like influenza, and the implications for the understanding of the pathogenesis of the virus. Impairment of smell was noticeable in 5% of the 214 hospitalized patients, and a loss of taste was reported in 6% of the patients in the Wuhan COVID-19 series (Mao et al. 2020). As a result of incomplete evaluations in the hospitalized patients, it is probable that the frequency of these symptoms were underrepresented. A subsequent study was conducted on 31 patients, in which a loss of smell was reported in 81% of the COVID-19 patients (29% hyposmia, 46% anosmia, and 6% dysosmia), while impaired sense of taste was reported in 94% (23% hypogeusia, 45% ageusia, and 26% dysgeusia) (Beltran-Corbellini et al. 2020). As reported, the disorders pertaining to loss of smell and taste had an average duration of 7.1 ± 3.1 days. A European study conducted at multiple centers on 417 cases with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease revealed a similarly higher frequency (86%) of patients suffering from olfactory dysfunction, with 20% and 80% of the patients manifesting hyposmia and anosmia, respectively (Lechien et al. 2020). Within 8 days of the onset of symptoms, 70% of the patients had recovered.",
            "There have been suggestions that gustatory or olfactory dysfunction can indicate neuroinvasion and offers a route to the cardiorespiratory centers in the medulla from the oropharynx or the nasopharynx. These suggestions are based on studies conducted on transgenic mice infected by SARS-CoV and expressing the human SARS virus receptor (ACE2). At present there is no evidence to support host entry through this pathway in humans (Netlandet al. 2008). The direct infection from the virus and the subsequent killing of the gustatory and olfactory neurons in many patients may seem highly unlikely due to the transient nature of the dysfunction (Galougahi et al. 2020). Of the Wuhan COVID-19 series, 11% of patients reportedly exhibited evidence of skeletal muscle injury, which is defined as skeletal muscle pain and creatine kinase (CK) > 200 U/L (Mao et al. 2020). Patients with severe disease (19%) exhibited injury more commonly than patients with non-severe disease (5%) (p < 0.001). However, unfortunately, other than the presence of the associated muscle pain, there are virtually no clinical details available. Two subsequent reports point to the presence of rhabdomyolysis as a hallmark or a late complication of COVID-19 (Suwanwongse and Shabarek 2020; Jin and Tong 2020). One of the patients exhibited weakness along with limb pain, with peak myoglobin > 12,000 µg/L and CK of approximately 12,000 U/L, while another patient reported peak CK of 13,581 U/L. Although the mechanism of the injury is still to be determined, no muscle biopsy was performed on either of the patients.",
            "Amongst the extremely confusing hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 infection is that almost 80% of patients, especially young adults or children, either exhibit minor symptoms or are asymptomatic. Only 20% of COVID-19 patients experience notable symptoms of infection, with extremely varying degrees of harshness. However, a definitive understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis from the knowledge that we have gathered on SARS-CoV is elusive. The first line of defense for the suppression of various neurotropic viruses at the point of entry or distribution is the successful production of type I interferon (IFN) response. Suppression of the downstream signaling of type I IFN response by SARS-CoV occurs with the assistance of various mechanisms, which are closely related to the severity of the disease (Channappanavar and Perlman 2017). As there is overall genomic similarity of over 80% between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and they both use the same receptor, it is reasonable to expect that the innate immune mechanisms involved in pathogenesis are almost identical for the two viruses. Multiple strategies have been developed by SARS-CoV to optimize its replication ability and to evade the innate immune response (Nelemans and Kikkert 2019), and it seems that the same strategies are used by SARS-CoV-2. To exercise any control over the replication of the virus without actually causing any immunopathogenic injury, it is important to accurately calibrate the response of the immune system in front of SARS-CoV-2. A significant role is played by the hyperinflammatory response in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), where in a subset comprising children, it can lead to the development of a multi-system inflammatory disorder such as Kawasaki disease (Bryce et al. 2020).",
            "Elevated lung cytokine/chemokine levels along with the associated vascular leakage and lethal pneumonia results from rapid SARS-CoV replication and delay in IFN-I signaling, which is responsible for inflammatory monocyte-macrophage accumulation. This is in turn related to suboptimal T-cell response to SARS-CoV and reduction in the number of T cells (Channappanavar et al. 2016). Similar patterns were found in a study on 522 patients who were infected with COVID-19, which revealed that the total number of T cells, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ cells, were dramatically reduced, especially in patients who required ICU care. T-cell numbers were negatively correlated with serum IL-10, IL-6, and TNF-α concentrations. Conversely, patients who were in the period of disease resolution exhibited lowered serum IL-10, IL-6, and TNF-α levels as well as restored T-cell counts (Diao et al. 2020). These data were substantiated by other groups who witnessed a reduction in type I IFN response in patients who were severely affected (Qin et al. 2020; Trouillet-Assant et al. 2020). Moreover, there have been suggestions that delayed and reduced production of IFN-γ (“too little too late”) in the lungs and reduction in both CD4 and CD8 T cells can occur in combination, which may lead to viral injury by a reduction in the control of the replication of the virus and enhancement of pro-inflammatory cytokine upregulation, including IL-10, IL-6, and TNF-α (“cytokine storm”), and it may be the immune dysregulation as much or more than the direct viral infection that results in pulmonary epithelial cell injury. Similar mechanisms could be operative in the CNS (Pedersen and Ho 2020). Moreover, the probable mechanisms for the dysregulation of the immune system and whether they play any role in the neuropathogenesis of COVID-19 are unknown. Although there is still obscurity regarding the sources of cytokines that are found in the serum, it is possible that they can be produced by lung macrophages. As observed in the transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV, IL-6 can also come from neurons that are infected (Netland et al. 2008). In turn, lymphocytopenia can be caused by higher levels of circulating cytokines. TNF-α, which is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that interacts with the receptor TNFR1, can cause T-cell apoptosis and is reported to have increased expression in aged T cells (Aggarwal et al. 1999; Gupta et al. 2005). IL-6 contributes to host defense in response to infections, exhibiting both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. However, a key pathological role has been demonstrated through the continual synthesis of IL-6 in chronic infection and inflammation (Gabay 2006; Jones and Jenkins 2018). IL-10, which is an inhibitory cytokine and prevents the proliferation of T cells, can also lead to the exhaustion of T cells. Moreover, levels of the programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) and T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3) exhaustion markers are observed in the T cells of patients who have been affected by COVID-19 (Diao et al. 2020). Conversely, the cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is weakened by the reduced number of CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes in very extreme cases, thereby creating the scope for further replication of the virus. The use of corticosteroids can significantly compound this problem. Of note, in a study conducted on convalescent patients with SARS-CoV, responses of CD8+ T cells were extremely regular and of greater magnitude in comparison to CD4+ T cells (Li et al. 2008). Finally, histological features that indicate secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) were suggested through an autopsy series of COVID-19 patients. This condition is also known as macrophage activation syndrome, which is characterized by an imbalance in adaptive and innate immune responses, with aberrant activation of macrophages and a blunted adaptive immune response (Bryce et al. 2020). This dysregulated immune response may play a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 encephalopathy. An increase in the levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines can lead to alteration and confusion of consciousness. However, the elimination of virus-infected cells in the brain may not be possible due to the weakened T-cell response, which may further lead to neurological dysfunction. There is an urgent need of carefully conducted studies on T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 and the CSF cytokine profile, along with postmortem studies, including the muscle tissues and CNS, to better understand the neuropathogenesis of COVID-19. These studies will help to gain a better understanding of whether the therapeutic strategies which are intended to completely stop pro-inflammatory cytokines (including the IL-6 inhibitors sarilumab and tocilizumab) can exert any significant positive effect on the encephalopathy, or whether corticosteroids are contraindicated where the adaptive cellular immune response to the viruses has been dampened. As efforts are being made to identify medications that can counter the deleterious inflammatory stage that is triggered by SARS-CoV-2, the outcomes of COVID-19 in patients exhibiting neurological diseases such as myasthenia gravis or MS who have been treated with immunomodulatory therapies can offer valuable lessons. While our understanding of the biological complexity of SARS-CoV-2 is still only in the nascent stage, it is certainly evident that a significant threat is posed by COVID-19 to the entire nervous system via the multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms and worldwide prevalence (Fig.5). As we are striving for a vaccine or a cure to counter the virus, an important role will be played by neurologists in diagnosing, investigating, and treating several of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 (Table 1) (McArthur 2020).Fig. 5Putative mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis: SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenic effects are likely multifactorial, including, involvement of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and muscle, direct neuroinvasion of the central nervous system (CNS), manifestations of systemic disease, as well as through a post-infectious, immune-mediated mechanism.

            "The involvement of the human nervous system has been supported by several lines of evidence in MERS, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). It is still difficult to determine how the overall pathophysiology is related to the varied neurological features, that is, whether they result indirectly or directly from viral infections, or arise from further mechanisms such as sepsis, hypoxia, or MOF. One of the potential available mechanisms is through the immune-related pathway. It appears that COVID-19 possesses a pivotal immune component, as various studies have reported findings such as increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and lymphopenia in patients affected by the disease (Huang et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020c; Mehta et al. 2020). One uncommon but fatal complication in COVID-19 that has recently gained significant attention, especially in those who exhibit severe disease, is cytokine storm syndrome, which includes secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) (Mehta et al. 2020). Therefore, patients with severe COVID-19 are constantly monitored for increased levels of ferritin, which is indicative of hyperinflammation. It is worth noting that one of the studies reported lower platelet counts and lower lymphocyte levels in those COVID-19 patients who presented CNS symptoms as compared to patients who did not present with CNS involvement (Mao et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020a, b). An increase in D-dimer levels, which is a marker of endogenous fibrinolysis and a hypercoagulable state, has also been reported in patients with severe disease and can possibly explain why the development of acute cerebrovascular disease is extremely common in patients exhibiting symptoms (Mao et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020a, b). There have been suggestions that the risk of acute cerebrovascular disease can be reduced through the early targeting of anti-inflammatory pathways (Li et al. 2020a, b).",
            "The neurological connection in SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV infections is an ever-expanding area of interest for neuroscientists. There are several reports that advocate the neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Most importantly, numerous mechanisms, including post-infectious immune-mediated processes, direct virus infection of the CNS, and virus-induced hyperinflammation, are commonly involved in SARS-CoV-2 neuropathology. Furthermore, CNS and PNS diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and its variants, dysfunction of taste and smell, muscle injury, hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, encephalitis, and meningitis are reported to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Needless to say, what we have learned is just the tip of the iceberg, and much remains to be understood in this domain for proper therapeutic intervention. Finally, improving our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 neurobiology could enhance our understanding of neurological impairments with probable viral associations such as MS and viral encephalitis.",

            "Background: Olfactory training is the only evidence-based treatment for post-viral olfactory dysfunction. Smell disorders after SARS-CoV-2 infection have been attributed to neuroinflammatory events within the olfactory bulb and the central nervous system. Therefore, targeting neuroinflammation is one potential strategy for promoting recovery from post-COVID-19 chronic olfactory dysfunction. Palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin (PEA-LUT) are candidate anti-inflammatory/ neuroprotective agents.",
            "Objective: To investigate recovery of olfactory function in patients treated with PEA-LUT oral supplements plus olfactory training versus olfactory training plus placebo.",
            "Methods: Multicenter double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was held. Eligible subjects had prior COVID-19 and persistent olfactory impairment >6 months after follow-up SARS-CoV-2 negative testing, without prior history of olfactory dysfunction or other sinonasal disorders. Participants were randomized to daily oral supplementation with ultramicronized PEA-LUT 770 mg plus olfactory training (intervention group) or olfactory training with placebo (control). Sniffin’ Sticks assessments were used to test the patients at baseline and 90 days.",
            "Results: A total of 185 patients, including intervention (130) and control (55) were enrolled. The intervention group showed significantly greater improvement in olfactory threshold, discrimination, and identification scores compared to controls (p=0.0001). Overall, 92% of patients in the intervention group improved versus 42% of controls. Magnitude of recovery was significantly greater in the intervention group versus control (12.8 + 8.2 versus mean 3.2 + 3), with >10-fold higher prevalence of anosmia in control versus intervention groups at the 90-day endpoint.",
            "Conclusion: Among individuals with olfactory dysfunction post-COVID-19, combining PEA-LUT with olfactory training resulted in greater recovery of smell than olfactory training alone.",
            "Clinical Trial Registration: (Italian; Clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT04853836)",
            "Nearly two-thirds of patients with COVID-19 report at least transient anosmia or hyposmia [1-4], and there is growing public health concern regarding COVID-19 chronic olfactory dysfunction (COD). [5] While most of these individuals will spontaneously recover baseline function within weeks [2,3], 10-20% of individuals report persistence of impaired smell or taste long after the acute phase of illness has subsided [3,6]. Persistent loss is particularly common among individuals suffering from post-acute sequelae of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also term long-haul Covid [7]. The unmet needs of these long haulers are increasingly recognized as a looming public health crisis [8]. Several treatments have been investigated [9], but the results have generally been underwhelming, with treatment recommendations emphasizing safety counseling in anticipation of sustained impairment [10]. To date, the olfactory training is the only disease-specific intervention with consistent evidence of efficacy for treating post-viral olfactory loss, but significant recovery is achieved in fewer than 40% of patients [11, 12]. The rising tide of patients with olfactory loss and the limited treatment options available provide an impetus for novel therapeutic strategies. One potential strategy for achieving recovery of chronic olfactory function involves targeting neuroinflammation.",
            "The rationale for reducing neuroinflammation derives from observations regarding the pathogenesis of COD in patients with COVID. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, the olfactory bulb and higher olfactory centers demonstrate sustained neuroinflammation [13, 14]. Patients with COVID-19-induced anosmia or hyposmia exhibit activation of pro-inflammatory microglia and associated neuroinflammatory changes along olfactory pathways [11-15]. Although human pathological data are limited, this finding suggests that lingering neuroinflammation can impede olfactory recovery [16]. Olfactory training, which involves repetitive stimulation of peripheral olfactory neurons, relies on the regenerative capacity of superior olfactory pathways [13]. Therefore, counteracting neuroinflammation during olfactory training might support olfactory recovery. Inflammatory changes are potentially more amenable to intervention than permanent neuronal loss, but it is unknown to what extent COVID-19 COD beyond 6 months is reversible.",
            "Although several anti-neuroinflammatory therapies have been proposed for treating disorders of smell and taste [17], clinical data on efficacy of such therapies for COVID-19 COD are lacking. Our study, therefore, investigated a novel anti-neuroinflammatory strategy aimed at improving olfactory function in patients with persistent smell alterations after COVID-19. We hypothesized that administering the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agents palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and luteolin (PEA-LUT) in conjunction with olfactory training would improve olfactory recovery more than placebo plus olfactory training. PEA-LUT has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation by modulating microglia and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) [18, 19]. We previously reported results of a feasibility study [19] with a small enrollment and short follow-up period, in which patients tolerated the protocol well and showed improved olfactory recovery at one month.",
            "The objective of this study was to investigate whether the addition of PEA-LUT to olfactory training influences the course of olfactory recovery in patients with post-COVID-19 chronic olfactory dysfunction. In this multicenter double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized trial, patients were administered either PEA-LUT or placebo for 90 consecutive days, and both groups of patients received concomitant olfactory training. Olfactory function was assessed at baseline and 90 days.",
            "This study adhered to CONSORT guidelines for Clinical Trials (Fig. 1). We performed a multi-center double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial. All patients included were recruited, screened, treated, and followed in the otolaryngology clinic of all centers. The study was authorized by the Institutional Review Board of Humanitas University with number 3002 registered at Clinicaltrials.gov in April 2021 with number: 20112020PGFN. It was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients signed a written consent before the inclusion in the study.",
            "This multicenter double-blinded randomized-clinical trial was conducted in three referral hospitals (Fano, Naples and Sassari) from April 2021 to October 2021. To recruit patients, we used word of mouth communication among clinicians and calls through newspaper, television, and internet (mass media). All centers used the same procedures and protocols. Patients were included or excluded based on the following criteria:",
            "Outpatients, ages 18 to 80 years, with a confirmed history of COVID-19 (positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2), and anosmia/hyposmia confirmed with the extended version of the Sniffin’ Sticks psychophysical test (TDI score < 31), persisting ≥ 180 days (6 months) after subsequent negative COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab and receiving the signature of informed consent with the agreement to participate to the study.",
            "Previous history of olfactory-gustatory disorders, active chemotherapy or treatment with estrogen inhibitors (aromatase), impaired cognitive function, history of neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease), medical therapy with known detrimental effects on olfactory function, presence of active rhinological disorders (sinusitis, rhinosinusitis, sinonasal polyposis, atrophic rhinitis, allergy) at the moment of the enrollment, history or chemo-radiotherapy of the head and neck region, history of stroke or neurotrauma, severe nasal blockage from stenosis or deformity, severe psychiatric illness (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, olfactory hallucination), previous sinonasal or nasopharyngeal tumors, or taking corticosteroid therapy to treat olfactory dysfunction within the previous 30 days. Additionally, any patients who were using medications with anti-inflammatory or immune-modulating effects that could interfere with PeaLut were excluded from the study.",
            "For each patient, the following demographic data were collected: sex, age, major disease, tobacco/alcohol use, medications, prior treatment for olfactory disorder, and time elapsed since negative COVID-19 test. A medical record was created for each patient that included: patient’s general medical and family health history, details on COVID-19 illness (date and symptoms at the onset, date of positive and negative PCR testing, treatments used during the infection, persistent symptoms, treatments used after COVID-19 resolution), information about COVID-19 vaccination. To this medical history record, we added a section for recording detailed data on the identification of smell and taste alterations. After verbally explaining the differences between anosmia, hyposmia, parosmia, and phantosmia to patients, we clarified the difference between taste alteration and sense of smell/flavor. Patients were then queried about their own history. At the end of the study (three months after randomization and initiation of therapy), the data were extracted and analyzed by a statistician, following the procedures stipulated by the study coordinator (ADS).",
            "The two study groups were defined as follows:",
            "Daily treatment with PEA-LUT oral supplement and olfactory training. The supplement contained co-ultra-micronized PEA 700 mg and Luteolin 70 mg (Glialia®, Epitech Group SpA, Milano, Italy) and was administered as a single dose, 5-10 minutes before breakfast plus olfactory training. Olfactory training entailed stimulation using four 100% organic essences (Lemon, Rose, Eucalyptus and Cloves) administered three times every day for 6 minutes each session; stimulation consisted in smelling an odor for 4-6 seconds, then 40 seconds of relaxation, and then, new stimulation for 4-6 seconds with another essence. This short duration was used to avoid “saturation” of the olfactory receptors [12]. Subjects performed this regimen for 90 consecutive days.",
            "Daily treatment with placebo and olfactory training. Patients in the control group received olfactory training as noted for the intervention group plus a daily placebo supplement therapy (multivitamin, vitamin D (400 UI), and/or alpha-lipoic acid (120 mg). The 400 UI dosage of vitamin D and 120 mg of alpha-lipoic acid were selected based on an evidence-based literature review documenting that these dosages do not exert significant systemic anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, or antioxidant effects [20, 21].",
            "All patients, after adequate training with the physician, performed the olfactory training independently at home (self-administered rehabilitation). The initial training consisted of a face-to-face explanation on how to perform the sniffing exercise, practice performing the exercise, and a written description on how to prepare the sniffing essence. This instruction was reinformed by providing access to an instructional video, which explains in detail how to perform the steps of olfactory training, available on “YouTube” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri5YwM6EmWM). The video recommended the clinician was always the same, as previously identified by the study coordinator. Participants in the study were in frequent communication (1 contact every 15 days) with clinic staff and physicians to promote adherence to the study protocol, with interaction via phone calls, electronic communications, and office visits.",
            "All patients (control and intervention) underwent the following assessments at T0 (baseline) and T3 (90 days after treatment):",
            "• Nasal endoscopic examination",
            "• Evaluation of olfactory function using the extended version of the Sniffin’ Sticks test",
            "The T0 nasal endoscopic examination was evaluated for the presence of polyps, masses, anatomic blockage, or other pathology, any of which would result in exclusion from the study. All patients were evaluated for olfactory function by Sniffin’ Sticks (Burghardt®, Medisense, Winschoten, The Netherlands). This initial olfactory evaluation was performed at the outset of the study (T0), before initiating olfactory training, with or without supplement treatment.",
            "Patients in the intervention group were evaluated by Sniffin’ Sticks every 30 days; in this way, we obtained the following observation points: T1, T2, T3. The subjects in the control group were instead re-evaluated after 90 days only because this is the minimum time to observe variation/improvement in the olfactory ability using the olfactory training [12]. This observational point was called T3, because assessments were performed 3 months after treatment. The patients routinely underwent nasal endoscopy before the Sniffin’ sticks assessment to ensure consistency in the therapeutic protocol.",
            "The Sniffin’ Sticks battery was administered following a previously established protocol [18], using standard pen-like devices filled with odorants. Clinicians conducting the scoring were blinded to the experimental group of patients. Three score subtests were conducted to measure olfactory function:",
            "(1) detection threshold (“T”, the lowest concentration at which an odor can be perceived),",
            "(2) odor discrimination (“D”, ability to distinguish between odors), and",
            "(3) odor identification (“I” ability to assign names to odors).",
            "Possible scores ranged from 1–16 for the detection threshold subtest and 0–16 for both the discrimination and identification subtests. Adding these, the subtests yielded a composite threshold/ discrimination/ Identification Sniffin’ Stick score, the “TDI score.” Anosmia was defined as a TDI score of <17, hyposmia by a TDI score 17 to 30.75, and normosmia by a TDI score of ≥31.",
            "The TDI score was calculated based on the patients’ performance on 3 sub-tests. In the first subtest (detection threshold), the odor detection threshold was determined using a triplet option, yes-no staircase, and forced-choice procedure with the odorant n-butanol, as previously described [22]. Briefly, participants were presented with triplets of odorant pens and asked to identify the pen containing n-butanol when presented with two blank distractor pens. In the second subtest (odor discrimination), the discriminative ability was assessed using 16 triplets of odorants: within each triplet, two pens contained the same odorant, while the third pen contained a different odorant. In a forced-choice procedure, the participants were asked to detect the odd pen for each triplet. In the third subtest (odor identification task), participants were presented with 16 common odors. They were asked to select which of 4 odor labels matched the presented odor in multiple-choice answering format. In prior literature, an incremental improvement of 5 points was accepted as the minimum variance for identifying a clinically meaningful response to olfactory training, based on statistical variances in patient outcomes [12]. Therefore, we defined the “recovery score” as <5 points or >5 points to delineate not only mean and median differences between groups but also to compare patients with clinically meaningful recovery.",
            "The primary outcome was the change over the time in TDI scores for the control group versus intervention group. The change in TDI score for any individual was reported as positive if olfaction improved over the 90-day study period, negative if olfaction worsened, and zero if no change, with the caveat that change in TDI score of <5 points from baseline does not necessarily constitute a clinically meaningful difference. The link between months after COVID-19 resolution (based on negative test) and Sniff' score, demographic analysis in relation to olfactory recovery, and examination of the correlation between age and sex in relation to baseline scores or recovery were all secondary outcomes. Clinicians conducting the study were also instructed to alert the principal investigators to any adverse events in patients with attention to intolerance, gastrointestinal symptoms, excessive drowsiness, or heart palpitations.",
            "Patients were assigned a number at the time of recruitment, and this reference number was used for tracking during randomization and throughout the study protocol. Using a block randomization within each site, eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to achieve approximately twice as many patients allocated to the intervention group as the control group [23, 24]. Randomization with 2:1 (intervention: control) was intended to maximize detection of any adverse effects, assess feasibility across institutions, and reduce the costs of conducting the trial [25-28]. After patient counseling and consent, the physician used computer-generated randomization for the assignment of patients. Participants were assigned to oral supplements plus olfactory training or olfactory training with placebo (Fig. 1). Randomization was performed using an online random number generator, with participants sorted based on a random generation of odd or even numbers until there was a minimum of 55 participants in the control group.",
            "Patients were informed that the purpose of the study was to investigate approaches for treating persistent loss of smell after COVID-19. Patients were informed that after baseline assessment, the treatment would include performing olfactory training and taking a supplement that would remain unknown to them but that had no reported drug interactions or safety-related concerns. Patients were also told that after baseline assessment, they would have a repeat TDI assessment at 90 days, with up to two possible intermediary TDI assessments, with an individual schedule dictated by protocol. Patients were instructed that their participation was voluntary and that they could withdraw from the study at any time.",
            "The study was performed in a double-blinded manner. The patients did not know their status in the control or intervention group (patient-blinding), with both groups receiving treatment with olfactory training and oral supplement. A single physician at each center performed the endoscopy, and a second physician performed olfactory testing. The physician who performed olfactory testing remained blinded to experimental group throughout the study. The physician who performed the nasal endoscopy had knowledge of the experimental groups and did not participate in olfactory assessment. Having these separate physician roles ensured that individuals performing assessments of olfactory recovery were always blinded to the patients’ treatment arm. Patients were blinded throughout the study, as well, and unaware of whether they were in the PEA-LUT or placebo arm of the study. All scoring assessments were performed by a blinded clinician. Data obtained by the olfactory test were anonymized, and results were collected on a protected Excel sheet shared by all the centers [Google (Mountain View, California, USA)].",
            "The sample size was calculated as indicated by Wang and Ji [29] and it was specific for Randomized Clinical Trial. The calculation was performed on the https://riskcalc.org. The calculator verified that the proposed sample of 100 in the intervention group and 50 in the control group would suffice to achieve adequate sample size with alpha (α)=0.05 at a statistical power level of 80%, with our design of a superiority trial for answering to our clinical question: “Is daily oral supplementation with ultramicronized PEA-LUT 770 mg plus olfactory training (intervention group) superior to olfactory training with placebo (control) at 90 days based on the assessment of olfactory recovery by TDI testing.” The plan was to enroll to a cutoff of 55 patients in the control group to allow for possible attrition over the course of the study.",
            "One-way ANOVA for paired measures and Tukey post-hoc (Tph) tests were used to analyze statistical differences in TDI score within the experimental group at T0, T1, T2, T3. Between-group comparisons were performed between control (T0 and T3) and treatment (T0 and T3). These same tests were performed to evaluate any differences by age or sex, at T0 and T3 across groups. Chi-square test was performed to analyze the difference between the control and intervention groups for TDI recovery scores. Point biserial was performed to analyze the effect of sex on recovery scores (difference between T0 and T3). Spearman for correlation between age and recovery score. Finally, we used longitudinal linear regressions to analyze the total effect of the variables (age, sex, comorbidities, and months of olfactory impairment) on the recovery.",
            "Difference in TDI scores from T0 to T3 was defined as “recovery score” and compared between groups. Chi-square test was performed to analyze the difference between control and intervention groups for TDI recovery scores (>5 versus <5) and increase, decrease and unchanged scores. Analysis of association of sex with recovery scores (difference between T0 and T3) was analyzed by point biserial correlation; correlation between age and recovery scores was analyzed with Spearman correlation. Longitudinal linear regressions were performed to analyze the total effect of the variables (TDI baseline, age, sex, comorbidities, and months of olfactory impairment) on the recovery. Cohen’s d test was performed to evaluate the effect of different sample size on the outcome. Chi-Square analysis was used to review the distribution of TDI scores and the likelihood of improvement or worsening over the study period. Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to assess for normal distribution. Results are presented as mean and standard deviation (+).",

            "A total of 185 individuals who met the eligibility criteria were recruited for the study, and all completed the entire course of treatment, with 90-day follow-up (T3). In keeping with the 2:1 target randomization scheme and target recruitment (material and methods section), randomization yielded 130 individuals in the intervention group and 55 individuals in the control group. Groups’ characteristics are shown in Table 1.",
            "All patients had undergone one or more previous treatments for COVID-19 related persistent olfactory disorders: 44.8% (83) patients were treated with nasal steroids only (3 puff /day for 30 days), 7% (13 subjects) with oral steroids (25mg/daily for 7 days, then tapering up to 10 days). The remaining 89 patients (48.2%) performed traditional olfactory training as previously described [11,12] and some of them added oral supplement and vitamins, as described in Table 2. In all patients included in the study, olfactory loss had persisted beyond 6 months (180 days), in keeping with inclusion criteria.",
            "After 2:1 (intervention: control) randomization, the intervention and control groups were similar in the distribution of sex and comorbidities, with a predominance of women in both groups. None of the patients in the treatment or control group were under treatment with drugs expected to interact with the treatment regimens. PEA-LUT does not have known medication interactions, and no patients were receiving medications with systemic immunomodulant, anti-inflammatory, or antioxidant effects. Mean age was 5 years younger in the intervention group (p=0.04), corresponding to a small effect (Cohen d) on analyses. No patient safety or adverse effects were identified in either group. The data comparison between groups is shown in Figs. (2 and 3).",
            "The intervention group (n=130) was composed of 64% women and 36% men, with an average age of 42.1 +14.5 years. No differences were observed in the endoscopy findings between T0 and T3. Patients reported either hyposmia or anosmia with mean duration of 8.2 + 3 months (CI 95%: 6-16). Of the 130 patients in the group, from T0 to T3, 120 patients (92%) had improved (higher) TDI score, 9 patients (7%) had worsened (lower) TDI score, and 1 patient (1%) was unchanged. The mean TDI score increased from 20.6 + 7.9 at T0 to 29.8 + 7.5 at T3 (p=0.0001). 80 patients (66.7%) recovered by more than 5 points (mean 12.8 +8.2) of the TDI scores; 40 (33.3%) recovered 5 points or less (mean 3+1.9) (Fig. 4), including 7.8% of patients (10 people) with no recovery or worsening of score (mean point reduction of -3.8 +1.3). TDI scores recovered significantly from T1 to T3 in the intervention group (ANOVA: p< 0.00001). No statistically significant differences were observed between T0 and T1 (Tph: p=0.3), between T1 and T2 (Tph: p=0.2), or T2 and T3 (Tph: p=0.08). Statistically significant differences were observed between T0 and T2 (Tph: p=0.002), T0 and T3 (Tph: p <0.00001), T1 and T3 (Tph: p=0.0001) (Fig. 5).",
            "No statistically significant differences were observed by sex (Point Biserial: p=0.49); however, both women and men each showed statically significant recovery from T0 to T3 (ANOVA: p=0.0001). Age was also not correlated with smell recovery outcomes (Spearman: p=0.12). Prolonged olfactory dysfunction was positively statistically correlated with improvement after treatment (Spearman: p=0.00644).",
            "Multiple regression analyses showed that only TDI at the baseline affected the recovery scores (p<0.0001). None of the other variables influenced the recovery scores.",
            "The control group (n=55) included 69% women and 31% men, with average age of 47 + 14.6 years. No differences were observed in the endoscopy findings between T0 and T3. Mean duration of hyposmia or anosmia was 8.8 + 2.4 months (CI 95%: 6-12). Mean TDI scores did not differ from T0 (18.2 + 7.9) to T3 (19.5 + 7.3) (p=0.4). Within the group, 23 patients (42%) had an increase in the TDI score, 12 patients had a decrease in the TDI score (mean -1.3 + -1.4) and 20 (36%) were unchanged. Among those with an increase in TDI score (mean 3.25 + 3), 17 patients (73.9%) recovered 5 points or less (mean 1.8 + 1.5) and 6 patients (26.1%) had a mean recovery >5 points (8.1 + 1.6) (Fig. 4). No statistically significant differences were identified in demographic analyses.",
            "Multiple regression analyses showed that only the number of months of olfactory disorder influenced the recovery scores (p=0.01).",
            "The comparison among the groups showed statistically significant differences based on pre-and post- TDI scores (ANOVA: p < 0.00001) (F=13.23). No significant differences in TDI scores existed between the groups at baseline, T0 (Tph: p=0.7), but significant differences in TDI scores were present at the 90-day experimental endpoint, T3 (p <0.00001) (Figs. 4 and 6). Chi-square showed statistically significant differences (p <0.00001) in the likelihood of recovery to normal TDI score (>31) at T3, favoring the intervention group over control group, 56% and 10% respectively. Similar statistical differences were observed in “increase, decrease, or unchanged” TDI score among the groups. For analyses of the impact of the different sample sizes (control versus intervention), Cohen’s d was 0.8 (CI95%: 1.046-1.763) pre-treatment and 0.8 (CI 95%: -2.163 to -1.41) post-treatment. This result indicated that the different sample sizes did not affect the difference observed between the groups at T0 and T3.",
            "Although persistent olfactory dysfunction affects a growing number of patients with Long-haul COVID, progress in identifying effective therapeutic strategies has been limited. Several therapies, including administration of oral or topical corticosteroids, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, intranasal calcium buffers, and other treatments, are under study, but evidence of benefit is thus far insufficient to guide clinical care [11]. Treatments generally target COVID-19 smell impairment arising from either peripheral damage (injury to nasal neuroepithelium), central inflammation (injury to olfactory bulbs or higher olfactory centers), or both [29]. In this trial, individuals receiving PEA-LUT during olfactory training had a significantly higher likelihood of recovering olfactory function than those receiving placebo; an increase in TDI score was observed in 92.2 percent of those receiving PEA-LUT versus only 42 percent of those receiving placebo, with significantly lower rates of residual anosmia in the PEA-LUT group.",
            "Looking specifically at the quality of the recovery, 56% of patients in the interventional group recovered to a normal TDI (>31) versus 10% only in control (Figs. 4 and 6). Regarding TDI recovery scores, the difference between intervention and control groups was wide, both in terms of likelihood of improvement and magnitude of improvement, as measured by a gain of over > 5 points (66.7% treatment versus 26.1% control). In the control group, the instances of recovery > 5 points could be related to the beneficial effect of olfactory training as previously reported by other authors [11, 12], to a placebo effect, actual benefit of placebo supplements, or a chance result. Alpha lipoic acid has antioxidant properties and plausibly could confer beneficial effects, as could other supplements; however, the placebo used has not been shown to have immunomodulant, anti-inflammatory, or antioxidant effects in the dosages administered [30]. Future work might consider a more inert placebo to remove the possible confounder of subclinical effects.",
            "In the interventional group, some patients (<10%) failed to improve or even had a worsening TDI scores; this outcome could be related to lack of efficacy, nonadherence, permanent injury to olfactory structures, non-neuroinflammatory cause of olfactory loss, or variable pharmacokinetics of PEA-LUT metabolism among patients [31]. Further work is necessary to understand whether a different dosing regimen could benefit these patients. We are currently investigating whether increasing PEA-LUT dosage improves TDI in patients who had only slight recovery and significant residual olfactory loss. For the intervention groups, TDI changes were assessed monthly to guide future research endeavors. We observed that a trend toward efficacy appeared within 30 days of use but was not significant until 60 days, with maximal efficacy after 90 days. This observation raises the question of duration of treatment -- whether therapy extending beyond 90 days might achieve complete recovery and whether benefits persist after treatment cessation. At the end of the therapy, only 56% of patients recovered normal TDI, so additional studies extending the time of PEA-LUT administration over 6 months should be performed. In addition, recovery in the control group was limited during the 90-day period studied, suggesting not only a lack of efficacy of the control treatments but also a lack of spontaneous improvement in patients with post-COVID-19 olfactory impairment that exceeds 6 months’ duration.",
            "The mean age of patients was in the 40’s for both groups, and this relatively young population may have responded better to therapy than older populations for several reasons such as, i) the level of neuroinflammation is thought to be lower in younger individuals than in elderly individuals; ii) senescence of olfactory neurons and age-related olfactory loss is not present in this age range [32]; and iii) neuroregenerative capacity is greater at younger ages [33, 34]. The young age of this cohort limits the generalizability of these findings, and additional studies on elderly patients are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for chronic olfactory dysfunction. We also observed that patients affected by the smell alteration for a longer duration (>12 months) were equally likely to benefit from the PEA-LUT treatment, suggesting a role for intervention even after several months of refractory olfactory loss. Many patients had received olfactory training, nasal steroids, or other treatments prior to enrolling in the study at T0, which may explain why further olfactory training with placebo was associated with little improvement in mean scores. An unexpected finding was that the duration of anosmia was positively correlated with olfactory recovery. This result differs from prior studies, which have shown a decrease in the likelihood of recovery of smell over time [10]. Recovery from COD would be unlikely if anosmia were solely attributable to permanent neuronal death rather than neuroinflammation and SARS-CoV-2 related olfactory loss.",
            "The link between olfactory loss and inflammatory neurodegenerative disorders is well documented, and the effects of PEA-LUT in COVID-19 merit future investigation. The role of neuroinflammatory response in frontotemporal dementia is supported by recent studies linking genetic mutations in microglial activation and risk of dementia [35, 36]. Some studies have speculated that COD may portend future emergence of neurodegenerative disease [37, 38], but it will be years before such associations can be assessed. Nonetheless, the available data support the rationale for further study of PEA-LUT in this context. Assays of serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with dementia reveal elevated cytokines and pro-inflammatory markers [39]. Pre-clinical studies document that PEA-LUT achieves neuroprotection through control of neuroinflammation [40, 41], and clinical studies suggest that the components of PEA-LUT can suppress neuroinflammatory dysregulation, activation of microglia and astrocytes, and severity of neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and frontolateral dementia, [42-44]. Further studies are needed to understand whether targeting or modulating neuroinflammatory pathways might allow for partial reversal of COD.",
            "Studies of the olfactory system demonstrate that after SARS-CoV-2 enters the olfactory neuroepithelium, it can spread to the olfactory bulb and other areas of the central nervous system [45]. Even after recovery from acute infection, SARS-CoV-2 can persist in the olfactory bulbs of patients, contributing to prolonged olfactory deficits [46]. D’Ascanio et al. [3] reported persistent olfactory alteration in approximately 14% of individuals, although prevalence varies across studies [47]. Patients with altered smell may report headache or brain fog [5, 48-50], findings suggest brain inflammation as a common mediator of symptoms [51]. Studies with MRI have also documented inflammatory alterations to olfactory bulbs with COVID-19 [52, 53].",
            "Such observations are consistent with an integrated explanation involving neuroinflammation. SARS-CoV-2 induces pro-inflammatory microglia within the olfactory bulb [53], diffuse neuro-inflammation [46, 53], and spread to other parts of the brain [54] contributing to the constellation of neurological symptoms comprising long-COVID [6, 48]. The administration of PEA-LUT was intended to support regeneration during olfactory training by reducing degree of SARS-CoV-2 induced neuroinflammation [44, 55]. The PEA component modulates the polarization of microglia to M2 protective phenotype [56], supporting neural regeneration and recovery of smell. Luteolin, in turn, blocks the polarization of pro-inflammatory microglia, inhibiting neural cell degeneration [43]. Reducing neuro-inflammation with PEA-LUT may explain the differences in the outcomes observed among the groups if PEA-LUT complements olfactory training to improve regenerative capacity and neuroplasticity of the olfactory bulb [18].",
            "Very few randomized clinical trials on therapeutics for olfactory loss are available. To our knowledge, this trial is the first to systematically investigate oral supplements combined with olfactory training for post-Covid-19 anosmia or hyposmia. The literature reports the efficacy of olfactory training for treating other post-viral infection smell disorders [57, 58], but few data are specific to COVID-19. Most therapeutic clinical trials treating smell alteration in COVID-19 have focused on topical applications, primarily corticosteroid nasal sprays [59, 60].",
            "Although the results of this clinical trial are consistent with the hypothesis of a potential anti-neuroinflammatory effect of PEA-LUT, no evaluation of inflammatory biomarkers (blood/urine) was performed in this study. Therefore, the mechanism of olfactory recovery observed remains speculative and awaits further investigation.",
            "Several limitations should be considered when assessing the significance and generalizability of these findings. We hypothesized that neuroinflammation underlies persistent olfactory loss in this population, but we made no assessment of baseline or post-treatment neuroinflammation with biomarkers, nor did we establish dose-response relationships or conduct pharmacokinetic analyses; further work might incorporate neuroimaging, serological measures of inflammation, and detailed assessment of optimal dosing regimens. Second, since both groups received olfactory training, we cannot discern whether improvement in TDI scores in the intervention group was attributable to PEA-LUT alone or interaction with olfactory training, nor did we collect data on either qualitative disorders of smell (parosmia, phantosmia) or disorders of taste. Third, although the unequal randomization scheme increased the opportunities to detect any untoward effects and potential for therapeutic benefit, it added complexity to allocation with a small control versus intervention group and lower statistical power; the failure to detect any demographic associations should be interpreted accordingly. Also, although the mean age of both groups was young, the lower mean age in the intervention group may have improved response to therapy and increased the likelihood of spontaneous improvement. Fourth, patients in the placebo group were only re-evaluated by Sniffin’ Stick after 90 days, because this interval corresponds to the suggested minimum time for assessing the efficacy of treatments aimed at promoting olfactory recovery [11, 12]. To mitigate potential bias relating to the differential assessment schedule, we asked all patients to complete a diary of their treatment, and both groups had regular contact with the research team through follow-up calls and emails. Last, despite a strong treatment effect, the study had heterogeneity in outcomes within each group and had limited follow-up of 90 days, so it is unknown whether the adherence to regimen and recovery would be sustained with a longer duration of therapy. Future work investigating longer durations of therapy may benefit from tracking adherence at standard intervals, although frequent team interactions with subjects prevented attrition during the present study.",
            "This randomized trial found that oral supplementation of PEA-LUT, when combined with the olfactory training, is associated with improved olfactory recovery compared to olfactory training with placebo. PEA-LUT should be used for 60 days at least to prove statistically significant efficacy. The multimodal approach is intended to reduce neuroinflammation within the olfactory system and create a regenerative milieu conducive to olfactory recovery. The observation of olfactory recovery in patients with olfactory loss in excess of 12 months suggests that some SARS-CoV-2 related injury is reversible long after the acute illness has subsided. Further longitudinal studies are necessary to clarify the optimal timing and dosing parameters for patients with limited or absent recovery from COVID-19 associated olfactory loss, and to evaluate the effect of the molecule on neuroinflammation using specific neuroinflammatory biomarkers.",

            "COVID-19 patients can exhibit a wide range of clinical manifestations affecting various organs and systems. Neurological symptoms have been reported in COVID-19 patients, both during the acute phase of the illness and in cases of long-term COVID. Moderate symptoms include ageusia, anosmia, altered mental status, and cognitive impairment, and in more severe cases can manifest as ischemic cerebrovascular disease and encephalitis. In this narrative review, we delve into the reported neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19, as well as the underlying mechanisms contributing to them. These mechanisms include direct damage to neurons, inflammation, oxidative stress, and protein misfolding. We further investigate the potential of small molecules from natural products to offer neuroprotection in models of neurodegenerative diseases. Through our analysis, we discovered that flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and other natural compounds exhibit neuroprotective effects by modulating signaling pathways known to be impacted by COVID-19. Some of these compounds also directly target SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. Therefore, molecules of natural origin show promise as potential agents to prevent or mitigate nervous system damage in COVID-19 patients. Further research and the evaluation of different stages of the disease are warranted to explore their potential benefits.",
            "Patients presenting severe pneumonia by an unknown cause were reported in China in December 2019. By January 2020, Chinese authorities reported a novel coronavirus (CoV) as the cause of the illness [1,2]. This novel virus matched the lineage B of the genus betacoronavirus showing >85% identity with a bat SARS-like CoV [1]. Hence, this virus was included in the family containing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV (79% of genome identity), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV (50% of genome identity), and four other CoVs associated with the common cold [2,3]. Later, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2, and COVID-19 the disease caused by it [2,4]. By the end of January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared SARS-CoV-2 as a Public Health Emergency of international concern, and by March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic [4]. As of 15 March 2023, more than 760 million people worldwide have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, with approximately 6.87 million deaths [5].",
            "Since the beginning of the pandemic, different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 and multiple variants have emerged [6]. The appearance of variants with D614G mutation in the spike (S) protein quickly became dominant strains. This mutation allowed for better binding of the viral S protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, accelerating virus infectivity and spread [7]. To date, other variants with important clinical implications have appeared [8]. Such variants are classified according to the potential or known impact of the mutations on the effectiveness of health measures, the severity of the disease, and the ability to spread from person to person [5].",
            "The emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 are classified into variants of interest (VOI) and variants of concern (VOC). VOI have specific genetic markers associated with changes promoting increased virulence, reduced neutralization by antibodies generated by natural infection or vaccination, and the ability to evade detection or a decrease in the efficacy of vaccination. Eight VOIs have been described: Epsilon (B.1.427 and B.1.429); Zeta (P.2); Eta (B.1.525); Theta (P.3); Iota (B.1.526); Kappa (B.1.617.1); Lambda (C.37), and Mu (B.1.621) [9]. VOC are variants that meet the definition of VOI and that may be associated with one or more of the following: (1) increased transmissibility or detrimental change in the epidemiology of COVID-19; (2) change in the clinical presentation of the disease (more severe manifestations, including death); or (3) decreased effectiveness of public health and social measures [7]. The following VOCs have been described: Alpha (B.1.1.7); Beta (B.1.351); Gamma (P.1); Delta (B.1.617.2); Omicron (B.1.1.529) [9], with variants of the latter currently circulating [10].",
            "Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 range from asymptomatic to mild respiratory tract infections and influenza-like illness to severe illness with lung injury, multiple organ failure, and death. Within such a wide clinical spectrum, multiple varieties of neurological symptoms have been reported. In the present narrative review, we provide a detailed description of the neurological symptomatology in COVID-19 patients and their incidence, compiled from original articles, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews. Furthermore, we discuss the literature generated in the previous four years regarding the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 nervous pathogenesis. Finally, we present in vitro, in vivo, and clinical evidence showing that neuroprotective compounds reduce the effects of COVID-19 in the nervous system by targeting the molecular pathways supporting SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or neuronal damage.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with an approximate 60–140 nm diameter with spike projections that emerge from the virions’ surface, a characteristic of the Coronaviridae family [1,11].",
            "The initial 20 kb downstream the 5′ end of the viral genomic region is occupied by the open reading frame (ORF) 1a and 1b, which encodes the polyproteins (pp) 1a and 1ab that contain nonstructural proteins (NSPs). Polyprotein pp1a generates NSP1 to NSP11 whereas pp1ab comprises NSP1 to NSP16. Although NSPs are not included in the viral particle, they play an important role in RNA synthesis and processing, contributing to viral propagation [12]. The remaining 10 kb, preceding the 3′ end, code for four structural proteins (10): spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) [13].",
            "The S protein plays a key role in virus pathogenesis, infectivity, induction of immune response, and evolutionary mutation [14]. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein binds to ACE2, mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells [15,16]. Notably, protein S shows a high diversity, caused by selective pressures and adaptive changes over time, which determine a stabilizing interaction in the spike-ACE2 complex [17].",
            "After binding, early viral entry via membrane fusion is promoted by S protein cleavage between S1 and S2 domains by the host protease TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) [18]. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in multiple tissues, including lung, kidneys, small intestine, colon, brain, heart, liver, and blood vessels [19,20,21,22], making these tissues susceptible to viral infection. In cells expressing insufficient TMPRSS2, the ACE2-bound virus can be internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis in the late endolysosome, where the junction of S1–S2 subunits of the S protein is cleaved by endosomal proteases, especially cathepsin L [18,23]. After the S1 subunit is shed, the S2′ site is cleaved, either by TMPRSS2 on the surface cell or by cathepsins in endosomes, activating membrane fusion [18].",
            "TMPRSS2 inhibitors and cathepsin inhibitors reduce virus infection with different efficacy, indicating that both entry routes are active and cooperate. Thus, the combined treatment with TMPRSS2 inhibitors and cathepsin inhibitors further reduces virus infectivity [15,24]. Accordingly, ACE2 [24], TMPRSS2 [25], and cathepsin L [26] are host-based targets for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies.",
            "After RNA release into the host cells, multiple NSPs control RNA transcription, translation, and protein synthesis required for viral replication; thus, such proteins have been targeted for therapeutic development. For example: (i) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, also known as Nsp12) is a crucial component of the genome replication/transcription complex of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) helicase (Nsp13) can unravel double-stranded (ds) DNA and RNA along the 5′–3′ direction and is vital to viral replication; and (iii) Mpro (also known as 3CLPro) and PLPro (papain-like protease) participate in the viral replication through proofreading and excision of the polyproteins [27].",
            "Detailed reviews of SARS-CoV-2 structure and biology have been published recently [28,29].",
            "SARS-CoV-2 affects homeostasis, which can lead to life-threatening systemic complications. In the critical SARS-CoV-2 infections, the routes of viral spread in blood vessels are lymphatic, hematogenous, direct invasion of adjacent tissues, and pathogenic implantation. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in oral and nasal mucosa, stomach, heart, small intestine, colon, lymph nodes, blood samples, thymus, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain [30,31]. SARS-CoV-2, as SARS-CoV, causes pneumonia with severe lung damage in the worst cases, but SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible due to a higher basic reproductive rate and drives more severe illness [32]. SARS-CoV-2 enters the lung from the mouth and throat [33]. Since the lung has a large surface area, it has increased susceptibility to inhaled viruses. In addition, its high vascularization allows the rapid spread of viral particles.",
            "Direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells has been described. For example, ACE2 is expressed in the type II alveolar epithelial cells [34], ciliated columnar epithelial [35], and AT2 (alveolar stem cells) [36]. These types of cells express multiple functional genes associated with the viral life cycle including TMPRSS2 [34,37]. SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells is accompanied by the infiltration of inflammatory cells, endothelial and inflammatory cell death, alteration of intracellular endothelial junctions, cellular swelling, and cell detachment from the basement membrane [38]. Therefore, pulmonary COVID-19 can be subdivided into four morphological stages, which include: (i) an early stage (day 0–1) with the presence of edema, initial epithelial damage and capillaritis/endothelialitis; (ii) diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) (days 1–7); (iii) the organizing phase (type II pneumocyte hyperplasia) (1 to several weeks); and iv) fibrotic stage of DAD (weeks to months) [39]. Detailed reviews of the pathogeny of severe pneumonia by SARS-CoV-2 infection were published previously [40,41,42,43].",
            "As mentioned before, other organs/tissues can also be infected and damaged by SARS-CoV-2. For example, impaired kidney function has been reported in 13–14.4% of COVID-19 patients [44,45]. SARS-CoV-2 infects the kidney by binding to ACE2 in podocytes. Then, the virus could reach the apical membrane of the proximal tubule either by accessing the tubular fluid or during proximal tubule cell injury in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) [46]. AKI in COVID-19 patients could be mediated by innate immune system over-activation, cytokine release, complement activation, angiotensin II (Ang II) hyperactivity, development of a hypercoagulable state, hypovolemia secondary to excessive diuresis, and/or increased venous pressure secondary to high positive pressure at the end of expiration [45,47].",
            "A detailed review of the SARS-CoV-2 target organs and the local pathogenesis mechanisms are available in [48].",
            "A comprehensive exploration of neurological disorders conducted by specialists from the World Federation of Neurology reports that SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and skeletal muscle [49]. Neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients (Figure 1), which are more frequent in severely ill patients (45.5%) [50], include: -Taste and olfactory dysfunctions (ageusia/anosmia). These are the most common PNS neurological symptoms of COVID-19. They develop in the early stages of the disease and can precede most symptoms; thus, they are considered useful diagnostic markers [51].-Headache: Headache is the most common nonspecific neurological symptom, with an estimated combined prevalence of 14.7% [52].-Altered mental status/confusion/delirium: Acute confusion/delirium may be a primary manifestation and the only presenting symptom of COVID-19 without evident lung disease [53]. The combined prevalence of altered consciousness/altered mental status is around 9.6% [52].-Dizziness: Its combined prevalence in patients with COVID-19 is 8.77%, according to a systematic review [54].-Stroke: The prevalence of acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with severe infections reaches approximately 6% [50]. In a retrospective study of 221 patients, 11 (5%) had ischemic stroke, one (0.5%) had cerebral venous thrombosis, and one (0.5%) showed cerebral hemorrhage [55]. Elderly patients with COVID-19 either with vascular risk factors or concomitant diseases such as hypertension or diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of developing cerebrovascular complications [55,56,57]. COVID-19 patients with acute ischemic stroke report visual deficits including hemianopia [58].-Epilepsies and seizures: COVID-19 lowers the seizure threshold in patients with existing seizure disorder and may also worsen a controlled condition [59]. SARS-CoV-2-associated seizures can also occur because of meningitis/encephalitis [60]. Several studies have reported that the incidence of acute symptomatic seizures due to COVID-19 is low compared to SARS or MERS. Two large studies each with >4000 COVID-19 patients from Iran or New York reported an incidence of <1% [61]. However, the prevalence might be higher in COVID-19 patients with preexisting or other comorbidities [61,62].-Encephalitis: A systematic meta-analysis study found that the incidence of encephalitis as a complication of COVID-19 is <1% for all patients but rises to 6.7% in those with severe disease. In addition, the mortality rate of patients with encephalitis as a complication of COVID-19 is 13.4%, almost four times that of the general population of COVID-19 patients [63].-Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS): COVID-19 patients with GBS can present weakness and paraesthesia of the lower extremities, progressing over several days and that can lead to generalized tetraparesis or tetraplegia [64]. Most of these patients have a demyelinating electrophysiological subtype corresponding to acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy [65]. In addition, acute motor axonal neuropathy and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy have been reported in COVID-19 patients [66,67].-Cognitive damage: COVID-19 can cause a cognitive deficit, mainly in attention and executive function, and verbal learning; and the incidence is associated with the severity of COVID-19 [68,69]. The prevalence of cognitive impairment due to COVID-19 infection is not well determined. Reported studies have been limited by sample sizes or suboptimal measures of cognitive functioning [70]. Some of the post-COVID cognitive symptoms may be associated with other systemic symptoms [37]. However, systematic reviews analyzing COVID-19 patients show that cognitive impairment ranges from 2.6% to 81% before or at 12 weeks of infection. After 12 weeks, cognitive decline ranged from 21% to 65% [34,71]. Another meta-analysis study that included 27 studies with 2049 individuals found impairment in executive functions (16%), attention (10%), and memory (24%) in post-COVID-19 patients [70,72]. Consistent results have been reported, even in recovered COVID-19 patients, showing lower overall cognition compared to healthy controls up to 7 months post-infection [72].-Impaired cranial nerves: Cranial nerve symptoms are more frequent and severe in COVID-19 than in previous SARS and MERS outbreaks, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 has a more neurotrophic and aggressive neuroinvasion. Multiple cranial nerve abnormalities in COVID-19 patients have been reported [73]. Although most olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) do not express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [74,75], there is evidence that sustentacular cells can serve as a vehicle for the virus, through transcytosis or exosomes, to infect OSNs and reach the brain. Moreover, the virus can impair the OSN renewal process by sustentacular cells in the olfactory epithelium or cause direct damage to CNS neurons. Another possible mechanism is that stem cells in the olfactory epithelium expressing ACE2 are infected with virus from sustentacular cells, and when these cells mature in OSNs they can carry SARS-CoV-2 to the CNS [74,76].",

Moreover, the virus can impair the OSN renewal process by sustentacular cells in the olfactory epithelium or cause direct damage to CNS neurons. Another possible mechanism is that stem cells in the olfactory epithelium expressing ACE2 are infected with virus from sustentacular cells, and when these cells mature in OSNs they can carry SARS-CoV-2 to the CNS [74,76].",
            "Since the prevalence of hyposmia/anosmia (27.2%) and hypogeusia/ageusia (30.8%) is high in several studies, it is likely that the most frequently involved cranial nerves are I, VII, IX, and X [77]. However, if these common symptoms are produced by virus damage to the CNS or systemic immune response, it can be expected that other cranial nerves are affected [78].",
            "In addition, it is known that the neurons of the terminal nerve (cranial nerve “0”) enter the brain through the cribriform plate and connect the nasal epithelium with the brain centers’ caudal to the olfactory bulb, the medial forebrain (septum), the preoptic area, and the hypothalamus. Although they are rare in humans (in contrast to the greater numbers found in marine mammals), they innervate blood vessels and are in direct contact with the subarachnoid space. These characteristics make it an almost ideal conduit for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to the caudal centers of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and the vascular system [76].",
            "Skeletal muscle symptoms: COVID-19 patients present fatigue, myositis, myalgia, and skeletal muscle injury. Most coronavirus infections can cause functional defects and myalgia or generalized weakness in skeletal muscles with elevated levels of creatine kinase [79]. In SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, several cases report skeletal muscle symptoms, including back pain, dyskinesia, and lower limb paresthesia [80]. Myalgia prevalence varies widely between studies, from 3.36% to over 64%, with an estimated combined prevalence of around 19.3% [52].",
            "An investigation of 213 COVID-19 cases indicated that 85.2% of patients had significantly elevated serum creatine kinase [81], which can be caused by skeletal muscle injury [79]. Likewise, cases of rhabdomyolysis have been described [82].",
            "Both direct or indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the central nervous system can contribute to neurological and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 [83]. In the following sections we review the underlying mechanisms.",
            "SARS-CoV-2 can reach the CNS via the olfactory tract [84]. The human olfactory epithelium is a pseudostratified epithelium composed of Bowman’s glands, horizontal and globose basal cells, microvillar cells, sustentacular cells, and olfactory sensory neurons that extends a single axon towards the olfactory bulb in the brain. Sustentacular cells in the olfactory epithelium exhibit high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [75] and a study in hamsters showed SARS-CoV-2 active infection in those cells [85]. In agreement, autopsies of COVID-19 patients revealed that the olfactory sensory epithelium was severely damaged [75]. Despite the absence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the olfactory sensory epithelium, the olfactory nerve tissue was found to be positive to SARS-CoV-2 in post-mortem examinations of COVID-19 patients [86]. Thus, it is possible that the replication of virions in the olfactory epithelium leads to infection in the olfactory bulb as blood vessels and pericytes in this brain region express both proteins [87,88]. These neurotrophic properties of SARS-CoV-2 explain the onset of anosmia as a prior symptom [89]. Interestingly, in mice, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the olfactory epithelium increases with age [75,90], suggesting a possible mechanism by which older patients are more vulnerable to the disease and neurological complications.",
            "Furthermore, the virus can reach brain tissue by the hematogenous route, in which endothelial cells or leukocytes are infected by the virus that passes from the bloodstream to the CNS [75] across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) [91,92] or by transmigration of peripheral immune cells, following the “Trojan horse” mechanism [93,94]. For example, brain vascular cells and choroidal barrier cells robustly express several genes that are relevant for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain [95]. SARS-CoV-2 infects and crosses an in vitro model of the BBB comprising primary brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes [96]. Infection of ACE2-overexpressing primary human endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 induces the overexpression of coagulation factors, adhesion molecules, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the formation of multinucleated syncytia and endothelial cell lysis [97]. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 alters the function and integrity of the BBB, which contributes to viral encephalopathy [98,99].",
            "Furthermore, ACE2 receptors have been found in glial cells of the brain and spinal neurons, so SARS-CoV-2 can adhere, multiply, and cause direct damage to neuronal tissue [100]. Neuronal infection has been associated with neurodegeneration and neurovascular remodeling [101], causing cerebral vascular/endothelial dysfunctions that can generate cerebral circulatory disturbances [102]. Helms et al., using perfusion imaging, demonstrated in patients with COVID-19 that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion causes bilateral frontotemporal hypoperfusion, demonstrating cerebral circulatory impairment [103]. As consequences of cerebral hypoxia, COVID patients can show cerebral vasodilation, brain cell swelling, interstitial edema, obstruction of cerebral blood flow, and even headache due to ischemia and congestion [104].",
            "Exacerbated inflammation participates in the damage to nervous tissue, as in other target organs. SARS-CoV-2 elicits an exacerbated and deregulated immune response of soluble immune mediators, termed a “cytokine storm” [105]. Multiple immune mediators, such as IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL10, TNFα, and other diverse cytokines are produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and have been associated with functional alterations or tissue damage in different organs, including the brain [106].",
            "In addition, elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines could participate in aggravating neuropathies during critical COVID-19 illness. The overproduction of systemic inflammatory factors (cytokines, nitric oxide, and oxygen radicals) has been associated with the malfunction of peripheral nerves [107] as well as microvascular disorders and electrical and metabolic (channel) disturbances in muscle cells [108].",
            "In addition, chronic damage to other systems can also damage the CNS through ischemia, metabolic dysfunction, and hormonal dysregulation [109]. Coagulopathy and endotheliopathy triggered by cytokine storms are potential mechanisms causing ischemic stroke in COVID-19 patients [110,111]. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients have elevated levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen, VWF activity, and factor VIII [112], leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, increased partial thromboplastin time, and low levels of antithrombin activity [113]. COVID-19 patients are at an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation [114].",
            "Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) can be caused by the hypercoagulable state in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may be triggered by endothelial dysfunction that predisposes vessels to thrombus formation, platelet dysfunction, hypoxia, and/or alterations of the complement system [115,116]. CVT may cause generalized neurological deficits [117] and there are multiple reports of its association with SARS-CoV-2 infection [118,119].",
            "Moreover, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) can contribute to the appearance of brain damage and systemic hyperinflammatory state in COVID-19 patients [120,121]. It has been reported that during SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) the local levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) increase, acting on angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT1), and thus increasing arterial pressure; (2) there is endothelial dysfunction in the cerebral vessels in the CNS, which increases the risk of cerebral hemorrhage; and (3) the generation of Ang (1–7) decreases, preventing the vasodilator, neuroprotective, and antifibrotic effects of Ang (1–7)/Mas receptor signaling [122,123].",
            "An overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the deprivation of antioxidant mechanisms are known to be crucial for viral replication and subsequent virus-associated disease, as shown by increased ROS levels and impaired antioxidant defense during SARS-CoV-2 infection [124]. The viral protease Mpro activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB)-mediated transcription, which correlates with increased levels of intracellular ROS [125]. In addition, Mpro causes a significant increase in ROS production in HL-CZ cells, which, in turn, induces cellular apoptosis. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 increases oxidative stress in nervous tissue, which contributes to neuronal cell death [126,127]. A post-mortem case study showed that 37 of 43 COVID-19 patients had astrogliosis and 34 had microglial activation in the brainstem and cerebellum [128]. In a preclinical trial, neuronal microgliosis in the brain has been observed to persist beyond SARS-CoV-2 clearance [129].",
            "Protein misfolding and aggregation have also been reported in COVID-19. Interactions between the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor ACE2 favor the spread of cytosolic prions and tau aggregates [130].",
            "The RBD domain of the S1 subunit from SARS-CoV-2 S protein (RBD SARS-CoV-2 S1) binds heparin and heparin-binding proteins, accelerating the pathological aggregation of brain proteins, including Aβ (amyloid beta), α-synuclein, tau, prion, and TDP-43 RRM [131]. In addition, SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters develop microgliosis in the olfactory bulb and selective accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and α-synuclein in the cortex after virus clearance, indicating that proteinopathies can be generated in neurons post-infection [129]. Although further studies are required, this evidence suggests that protein misfolding may play a role in the neurological symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
            "Neurotrophins are growth factors acting as regulators of neuronal survival, development, function, and plasticity [132]. Neurotrophins include nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) [133]. In addition to their classical functions, they regulate axonal and dendritic growth and guidance, synaptic structure and connections, neurotransmitter release, and long-term potentiation, a cellular mechanism underlying memory and learning [134]. The circulating levels of BDNF [135] and NGF [136] are reduced in adult COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals. BDNF reduction is higher in patients > 60 years of age [137], indicating age-dependent effects. Reductions in serum BDNF correlate with the severity of the disease [137,138] and cognitive impairment after recovery [139]. Interestingly, adult COVID-19 patients that required supplemental oxygen had even lower BDNF serum concentrations [135], showing an interplay between deregulated BDNF levels and viral hypoxia. These findings support the role of neurotrophins in regulating neurological outcomes in COVID-19 patients. However, further studies are required to define the extent of their participation and the mechanisms involved, especially in the long-lasting effects of this disease.",
            "Neurodegenerative diseases are triggered by a combination of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors [140]. These diseases share mechanisms of neural damage with COVID-19 described above (Figure 2). Since such mechanisms have been studied for several decades, they may provide a starting point for the identification of specific neuroprotective agents with COVID-19 application.",
            "For example, oxidative stress, the formation of free radicals, and/or a dysfunction of the antioxidant system causes brain damage due to its high oxygen demand and its abundance of lipid cells susceptible to peroxidation [141]. This, in turn, induces altered intracellular signaling that can lead to a dysregulation of the inflammatory response [142] and/or cellular damage by altering the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [143]. Thus, reducing ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and protein oxidation, and modifying the release of mitochondrial factors are desirable goals in the therapeutic intervention of neurodegenerative diseases [144,145].",
            "Similarly, neuroinflammation is a feature of neurodegenerative diseases. Innate immune cells within the CNS (microglia and astrocytes) as well as infiltrating immune cells are chronically activated in multiple sclerosis (MS) [146]. The accumulation of inflammatory cells and soluble mediators sensitizes neurons to further insults, triggering neurodegeneration by inducing apoptosis, necroptosis, neuronal autophagy, retrograde degeneration, and demyelination [147]. Accordingly, altering the concentration of chemokines and inflammatory cytokines, as well as the activation of astrocytes and microglia have been pointed to as goals of therapies in neurodegenerative diseases [144,145].",
            "The death of neuronal cells is an important mechanism of neurodegenerative pathogenesis and is associated with alterations in the signaling cascades of cell death such as apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy-associated cell death. Aberrant activation of cell death pathways results in an unwanted loss of neuronal cells and function [148]. These processes can be triggered by intracellular or extracellular stimuli and inflammatory processes [149].",
            "Excitotoxicity of neuronal cells (cell death due to excessive exposure to glutamate or overstimulation of NMDA glutamatergic receptors), is also common in neurodegenerative diseases [150]. Because of that, therapeutic goals include the modification of caspase activation and expression of proapoptotic proteins [144,145], and reduction in excitotoxic [151].",
            "Finally, aberrant protein misfolding, aggregation, and accumulation are hallmarks and pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases such as prion diseases, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and Parkinson’s disease (PD) (see [152] for a review). Reducing the formation of dysfunctional proteins caused by misfolding and agglomeration is a desirable effect in those neurodegenerative diseases [144,145].",
            "However, only a few drugs have shown efficacy in neurodegenerative diseases and have clinical application. For example, AD is treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine), which improves cholinergic neurotransmission [153], and/or the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine [154], which prevents excessive continuous activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, reducing excitotoxicity [155]. Thus, new potential pharmacological agents, with these or other relevant activities, are currently being sought [154].",
            "Evidence suggests that a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet rich in bioactive compounds reduces the risk of developing CNS pathologies [156]. Multiple compounds from natural sources, mainly from medicinal plants, have been identified as modifiers of the pathogenic causes for various neurodegenerative disorders [157,158,159].",
            "In this section we review the use of bioactive natural compounds as neuroprotective agents and discuss the evidence that suggests that they may be useful in COVID-19 treatment. Our literature search identified natural compounds with evidence of neuroprotection from common chemical classes, mainly flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids. Furthermore, some of those compounds with neuroprotective activity may elicit direct effects on the SARS-CoV-2 viral cycle, as reported for multiple compounds from natural sources [160,161,162], making them more attractive candidates for adjuvant therapies.",
            "Flavonoids are an important group of polyphenols with a wide range of biological activities. Flavonoids have been shown to be particularly effective in blocking pathological pathways associated with aging and neurodegeneration [163]. Bioactive flavonoids have good bioavailability and stability in circulating plasma and many of them reach the CNS [164,165,166], exerting their protective/restorative capacities in different neuronal populations.",
            "Flavonoids can elicit two different effects that may be beneficial in COVID-19 patients: neuroprotection, mainly because of their antioxidant activity, and modulation of inflammation. For example, the flavone apigenin reduces AD-associated memory impairment, prevents oxidative stress, decreases Aβ plaque load [167], inhibits inflammatory stress, limits apoptotic cell death, and reduces neuronal hyperexcitability [96,168,169]. Furthermore, apigenin attenuates microglial activation and neuroinflammation, counteracting dopaminergic neuronal loss, improving locomotor ability in a PD model [170,171].",
            "Quercetin, a flavonoid ubiquitous in fruits and medicinal herbs, has been widely studied for its neuroprotective effects. It antagonizes neuronal toxicity due to oxidative stress, suppresses neuroinflammation by down-regulating the activation of proinflammatory pathways mediated by NF-kB and iNOS, stimulates neuronal regeneration, and inhibits Aβ aggregation and tau phosphorylation [172]. Epicatechin is a flavonol found in blueberries, tea, cocoa, and grapes. It crosses the BBB [173] and exhibits neuroprotection through anti-apoptosis and anti-mitophagy effects in a model of Parkinson’s disease (PD) [174]. The combination of quercetin and epicatechin synergistically reduces ischemic neuronal cell death, preserves mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and confers protection against hypoxic-ischemic brain damage [175].",
            "Hesperidin and neohesperidin, flavonoids present in citrus, enhance the content of glutathione (GSH) and the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in animal models of ischemic stroke [176], and activates the Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway to inhibit oxidative stress and protect brain damage induced by cerebral artery occlusion [177].",
            "Furthermore, we identified multiple flavonoids that display a direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect (Figure 3A and Table 1), which may be further beneficial for COVID-19 patients. The direct antiviral activity of flavonoids is not new and has been extensively reported [178,179,180]. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of flavonoids was proposed at the beginning of the pandemic by computational experiments using SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a target and confirmed later by crystallography (Figure 3D). Quercetin, baicalein, and luteolin show anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and share structural features with reported Mpro inhibitors from natural sources (Figure 3E), suggesting they target viral proteins in addition to the neuroprotective actions. Subsequent preclinical evaluations confirmed a direct inhibition of viral entry and/or replication, as well as attenuation of systemic inflammation.",
            "Luteolin is a flavone widely distributed in the plant kingdom. Luteolin protects hippocampal damage and prevents learning defects in a rat model of AD [181]. Interestingly, luteolin attenuates microglial activation and excessive production of TNF-α, nitric oxide, and superoxide [182] and can reduce the activation of the TRIF-dependent signaling pathway of Toll-like receptors [183]. In addition, in SHSY human neuronal cells, it inhibits the transcription of β-secretase 1 (BACE-1), responsible for generating Aβ peptides [184]. It also reversibly inhibits human butyrylcholinesterase [185], which is one of the neuroprotective strategies of approved drugs. Luteolin has been shown to be an allosteric modulator of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 [186] and inhibitor of Mpro [187].",
            "Kaempferol is a flavonol present in various vegetables such as green tea with reported antiviral, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant effects [188,189]. Kaempferol can overcome the blood–brain barrier (BBB) with a single dose, reaching the hippocampus, frontal cortex, striatum, and cerebellum [190]. It has shown in vivo neuroprotective activity by attenuating the activation of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway in LPS-activated microglial cells [191]. Kaempferol modulates the antiepileptic target synaptic vesicle transporter 2A (SV2A) [192], inhibits 5-HT 3A receptors [193] involved in memory and cognitive functions, and blocks acetylcholinesterase (AChE) [194] implicated in cognitive dysfunction and memory loss associated with AD. Kaempferol decreases epileptic seizures in a rat model of chronic epilepsy, comparable to the control antiepileptic drug [192]. Kaempferol interacts with active sites of RdRp and Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 [195,196].",
            "Several alkaloids alter the pathophysiology of AD by functioning as muscarinic receptor agonists, antioxidants, acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors, α-synuclein aggregation inhibitors, anti-amyloid, and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors [197]. For example, galantamine is an AChE inhibitor that improves cholinergic neurotransmission, which is impaired in AD [198]. Piperine, a major alkaloid found in long pepper (Piper longum), showed efficacy in attenuating oxidative stress and improving cognition in the rat model of AD [199]. In the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced parkinsonian rat model, it decreased the inflammatory markers IL-1β and TNF-α [200]. In epilepsy, piperine delays tonic-clonic seizures by raising the cortical and hippocampal level of serotonin and GABA [201]. Others, such as harmaline, were shown to offset the toxic effects of dopamine oxidation in brain mitochondria, and together with harmine, increased antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and GSH peroxidase [202].",
            "As for flavonoids, we identified alkaloids that, in addition to a neuroprotective effect, may display anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (Figure 3B and Table 1). Berberine is an isoquinoline present in Tinospora cordifolia and roots, rhizomes, and stem bark of several medicinal plants of the Ranunculaceae, Rutaceae, and Berberidaceae families [203]. Berberine effectively crosses the BBB, which allows it to elicit neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects [204]. These effects are associated not only with its antioxidant action, but with the modulation of enzymes, neurotransmitters and molecular targets involved in neuropathology [205,206,207,208,209,210]. For example, berberine directly reduces ROS [211,212] and activates antioxidant mechanisms by regulating key signaling pathways, such as the P13K/AKT/Bcl-2 pathway and the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway [213]. Berberine is reported as an inhibitor of BACE1 and prevents Aβ 1–42 aggregation to delay the pathological process in AD [214,215,216]. It also improves motor stability and reduces dopaminergic neuron loss in PD [217] and reduces the deposition and aggregation of mutant huntingtin in HD, improving the coordination of movement and motor function [218].",
            "Berberine reduces SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication through direct interaction with the virion in Vero E6 cells and in human nasal epithelial cells [219,220]. In silico studies indicate that it may inhibit the function of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [221,222]. Through molecular docking and network pharmacology, it was found that berberine inhibits pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 pneumonia by reducing TNF-α, IL-6, STAT3, and CCL2 [223]. Likewise, berberine/NIT-X nanoparticles inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the expression of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes in the human lung epithelial cell line infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [81]. In a clinical study, berberine reduced circulating inflammatory mediators in patients with severe COVID-19 [96].",
            "The monoterpenoid carvacrol exhibits neuroprotective activities against cerebral infarction and the associated neurological deficits [224]. Those effects can be mediated by the reduction in inflammation caused by NF-κB inhibition, and inhibition of apoptosis through TRPM7 suppression and promotion of the PI3K/Akt pathway [225,226]. Celastrol (Figure 3C and Table 1), showed its neuroprotection in ischemic stroke by inhibiting the JNK/NF-κB pathway to suppress the inflammatory cascade in the ischemic brain [227]. Rotenone reduces apoptosis in a model of Parkinson’s disease by preventing the increase in ROS and the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential [228].",
            "Gallic acid and caffeic acid are phenolic acids with reported neuroprotective effects [229,230,231]. Gallic acid restores mitochondrial dysfunction [232] and improves the outcome of post-stroke depression treatment [233]. Caffeic acid improves neurological dysfunction and decreases infarct volume after focal cerebral ischemia in rats, with the inhibition of NF-κBp65 expression and reduction in malondialdehyde content through the downregulation of 5-lipoxygenase [234].",

            "Resveratrol, a stilbenoid widely used as an antioxidant, has neuroprotective activity in ischemic stroke [275,276]. Such an effect might be related to the activation of AMPK and the NAD + dependent deacetylase SIRT1, which participates in the adaptation to conditions of energy depletion [277].",
            "Curcumin, the major polyphenolic compound extracted from Curcuma longa plants, is an herbal medicine with antitumor, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antiviral activities. Using in vitro models, the antiviral/anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin against SARS-CoV-2 have been evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), showing an antiviral effect against the DG614 strain and Delta variant. It was also found that pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8) released by PBMCs decrease after treatment with curcumin. The results suggest that curcumin affects the replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle and exhibits virucidal activity with a variant/strain-independent antiviral effect and immunomodulatory properties [278].",
            "Curcumin has several desirable properties as a neuroprotective drug, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-protein aggregation activities, with potential for the prevention of neurological diseases such as AD, PD, Huntington’s, head trauma, aging, and stroke [279]. Curcumin decreases the production of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules in the brain of cerebral ischemic patients [280]. Since anti-inflammatory molecules are employed to protect COVID-19 patients from neurological disorders and severe organ-level damage, curcumin treatment could play an important role as a neuroprotector.",
            "Although the bioactive component of turmeric derived from curcuma has a variety of pharmacological activities, its use has been limited by its low solubility, poor bioavailability, rapid metabolism, physicochemical instability, and poor pharmacokinetics [281]. However, the encapsulation of curcumin into nanoformulations has been used to improve its pharmacokinetics, systemic bioavailability, and biological activity. Many nanoformulations have been approved for therapeutic use following the conclusion of preclinical and human clinical trials [282].",
            "At present there are multiple therapeutic alternatives for COVID-19 treatment. However, the precise effects of those therapies in the neurological effects of the disease are unclear or have not been studied yet, especially in the long-term onset. The evidence discussed in this review shows that molecules of natural origin with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and/or cytoprotective activities reduce neuronal damage and improve cognitive function. Thus, those molecules are attractive candidates to be further studied in the management of COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms. Importantly, the molecules discussed here have key characteristics that support clinical analysis: (i) they are cheap and easily accessible; (ii) they have good safety profiles and biodistribution to the CNS; and (iii) they have shown efficacy in models of other neurodegenerative diseases, in some cases, validating their use in traditional medicine. Still, there are multiple areas of opportunity in the field. For example, clinical trials designed to test the efficacy of neuroprotective compounds in COVID-19 patients are required. In those studies, pharmacokinetic analysis should include evaluation of the bioavailability to show that concentrations effective for neuroprotection are reached after oral administration. However, those trials may be difficult to run given that worldwide vaccination has reduced the number of patients with relevant clinical pictures.",
            "A subset of neuroprotective compounds also inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication or virus–host interaction. Studies analyzing the structure–activity relationship would allow the design of new molecules with selective or enhanced activities and potential clinical translation. Molecules showing anti-SARS-CoV-2 and neuroprotective activities may improve the prevention and/or mitigation of damage to the CNS induced directly or indirectly by SARS-CoV-2, offering additional benefits to COVID-19 patients.",
