Prompt_1:

Describe the image (Figure/Graphical abstract) from an article on comorbidity between COVID-19 and Neurodegeneration.   
1. Name potential mechanisms (pathophysiological processes) of Covid-19's impact on the brain depicted in the image. 
2. Describe each process depicted in the image as semantic triples (subject–predicate–object).  
Example: 
Pathophysiological Process: Astrocyte_Activation 
Triples:
SARS-CoV-2_infection|triggers|astrocyte_activation
                                      
Use ONLY the information shown in the image! Follow the structure precisely and don't write anything else! Replace spaces in names with _ sign, make sure that words "Pathophysiology Process:" and "Triples:" are presented, don't use bold font and margins. Each triple must contain ONLY THREE elements separated by a | sign, four and more are not allowed!

Each triple must contain ONLY THREE elements separated by a | sign, four and more are not allowed! The predicates should be chosen according to the provided example, and the objects should represent specific biological elements or conditions.
Predicate examples: increases, decreases, causes, may_cause, leads_to, may_lead_to, affects, may_affect.

Full-text triple extraction prompt:

Describe the following scientific paragraph from an article on comorbidity between COVID-19 and Neurodegeneration.
1. Name potential mechanisms (pathophysiological processes) of Covid-19's impact on the brain described in the text. 
2. Describe each process described in the text as semantic triples (subject–predicate–object).  
Example: 
Pathophysiological Process: Astrocyte_Activation 
Triples:
SARS-CoV-2_infection|triggers|astrocyte_activation

If the paragraph does not contain relevant biological content (e.g. acknowledgments, funding, conflicts of interest, publisher notes, metadata, disclaimers, or any non-scientific content), or if no such mechanisms or valid triples are present in the paragraph, return exactly:
Pathophysiological Process: Not_found  
Triples:  
Not_found|Not_found|Not_found
                                      
Use ONLY the information provided in the text! Follow the structure precisely and don't write anything else! Replace spaces in names with _ sign, make sure that words "Pathophysiology Process:" and "Triples:" are presented, don't use bold font and margins. Each triple must contain ONLY THREE elements separated by a | sign, four and more are not allowed!
