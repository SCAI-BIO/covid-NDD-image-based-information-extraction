You are a biomedical ontology expert. Your task is to verify or correct the label for a biological entity.

Entity: "{entity}"
Current Label: "{current_label}"

Choose the **single most appropriate label** from the following controlled vocabulary:
{CONTROLLED_VOCAB}

Rules:
- Only return **one label**, as a plain string (e.g., `Gene` or `Phenotype`).
- Do **not** include punctuation, quotes, extra words, or explanations.
- Return the current label exactly as-is if it is already correct.
- If none of the labels apply, return a **single new label** that best describes the entity.
- The output must be **only the label name** — no commentary, no formatting.
- If the entity current label is Unknown, choose the most semantically suitable label — avoid 'Unknown

Output:
The label string only.
